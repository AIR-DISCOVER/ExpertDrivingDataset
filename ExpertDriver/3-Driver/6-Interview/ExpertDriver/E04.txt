**Transcript:**

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, let's get started. We will review the video you recorded with the glasses you wore. The purpose of this interview is to understand your driving habits and behaviors. If you have any specific points you want to discuss while we watch the video, feel free to interrupt me. I will also have some questions for you, and our data will be kept confidential.

**Speaker 2:**
Sure, no problem.

**Speaker 1:**
What type of car do you usually drive? Gasoline, electric?

**Speaker 2:**
Mostly gasoline cars.

**Speaker 1:**
And what about the type of vehicle? SUV, sedan, sports car, off-road?

**Speaker 2:**
I've driven all types, but mostly sedans. I usually drive for my superiors. Have you driven cars with any autonomous driving features, like automatic parking?

**Speaker 2:**
Not full autonomous driving, but some assistive features.

**Speaker 1:**
Which assistive features have you used?

**Speaker 2:**
Cruise control, for example. Does that count? It's quite basic and commonly used. Another one is lane departure warning.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, those are assistive features.

**Speaker 2:**
I don't know the exact term, but it alerts you when you drift out of your lane. It's quite useful.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you use these features often?

**Speaker 2:**
Cruise control is used more on long trips. I don't really use automatic parking. I find it unnecessary for me, but it might be helpful for some people, like new drivers or those less familiar with parking.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you find these features not very necessary for experienced drivers like yourself?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you mostly drive in the city or do you often go on long trips?

**Speaker 2:**
Mostly city driving.

**Speaker 1:**
How was your experience driving our car?

**Speaker 2:**
Are you referring to the car itself?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, the driving experience.

**Speaker 2:**
It felt normal.

**Speaker 1:**
Nothing special?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was quite normal.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, let's take a look at the video.
Speaker 1: How do you feel about your driving?

Speaker 2: I feel it's normal.

Speaker 1: Hmm, nothing special?

Speaker 2: Yes, it's quite normal.

Speaker 1: Let's take a look at this video. This red dot here is the area you're focusing on.

Speaker 2: Yes, wherever you look, it will reflect on the screen.

Speaker 1: Earlier, you were exiting the parking lot, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, just like that point earlier. Even though you're turning right, you still need to check the left side.

Speaker 1: So, do you usually check the right side first or the left side?

Speaker 2: Typically, I think it's the right side because when you're turning right, you need to check the left side first to ensure it's clear.

Speaker 1: Hmm, almost. You might have noticed it earlier.

Speaker 2: It also depends on the road conditions. If you're turning right, you definitely check the right side first. But in this case, since there's a curve right after the turn, you might need to check the left side more.

Speaker 1: When you turn, do you have any specific habits or things you pay special attention to?

Speaker 2: When turning, it varies for everyone. For me, I always check both sides. Sometimes, I make a general judgment in advance. I don't always rely on the mirrors, but I have an 80% judgment about whether there's a car or not. When you approach the road, you already have a mental note of the surroundings.

Speaker 1: Can you describe your judgment process?

Speaker 2: As you move forward, you assess the situation on your right front side.

Speaker 1: Do you intentionally focus on specific areas or just glance quickly?

Speaker 2: I just glance quickly.

Speaker 1: So, you make an early judgment?

Speaker 2: Yes, it's an early judgment.

Speaker 1: When you enter a side road, do you have any specific driving habits?

Speaker 2: When entering a side road, you must be cautious and pay attention to pedestrians because side roads are not main traffic lanes.

Speaker 1: In the second part of the video, you seemed to drive faster. Was it more challenging?

Speaker 2: Actually...
Speaker 1:
If you don't mind, could you tell me about your experience driving back quickly? Was it stressful?

Speaker 2:
Actually, under normal circumstances, you should prioritize yielding to non-motorized vehicles, right?

Speaker 1:
Yes, motor vehicles should yield.

Speaker 2:
But earlier, they came over to this side, right?

Speaker 1:
For example, when you see a vehicle ahead, how do you usually handle it? Especially when you need to be precise.

Speaker 2:
In such situations, I usually want to let them pass first. Normally, I would signal, but if I notice they aren't moving after a couple of seconds, I proceed slowly. 

Speaker 1:
In such cases, how do you judge the intentions of other drivers? For instance, in the situation you just described, you waited to see if they would move.

Speaker 2:
Yes, when I approached, the car ahead was stationary. Normally, it would move slowly forward or come from the main road, but it stayed still. When I got closer, it was still not moving. It was hard to judge whether it was going to move or not. I wanted to let it pass, but since it didn't move, I proceeded slowly. It wasn't about competing with them; I just wanted to be cautious.

Speaker 1:
Do you often check your rearview mirror in such situations?

Speaker 2:
Yes, when merging onto the main road, I always check for vehicles on the main road. In China, the habit is to look to the left, right?

Speaker 1:
Do you have any specific habits when merging?

Speaker 2:
It depends on the situation. If there are no vehicles, I might merge quickly. If there are vehicles, I definitely check for them.

Speaker 1:
Do you always anticipate the need to make a U-turn?

Speaker 2:
If I need to make a U-turn, I usually follow the traffic signals. If there's a dedicated U-turn signal, I follow it. If not, I check for oncoming traffic and pedestrians. If it's safe, I proceed; otherwise, I wait.

Speaker 1:
I have another question. When you were about to make a U-turn, you were already in a forward position, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I was.
Speaker 1:
I have another question. When you first saw the dog on the road, you were already in a relatively forward position, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I was trying to maneuver around it because the car is a bit long, and itâ€™s not easy to make a sharp turn. I thought I could move a bit forward and then turn right. Even if I couldn't make it in one go, the area ahead wasn't restricted by any barriers. I wanted to go around it, but there were other cars coming, so I had to adjust my plan.

Speaker 1:
So, you felt it was better to move a bit closer to the front?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. If there were no cars, I would have moved forward a bit more. Even if I couldn't make the turn in one go, I would have tried. That was my thought process.

Speaker 1:
Oh, so you couldn't make the turn in one go. Did you check the left side and behind you?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I checked behind me. There was a median strip, so I mainly focused on the cars behind. If there was no median, I would have also checked the front. You have to be aware of oncoming traffic, right?

Speaker 1:
Then, during the driving process, especially when accelerating in a straight line, do you have any habits?

Speaker 2:
It's pretty straightforward. I don't have any special habits.

Speaker 1:
What speed do you usually maintain?

Speaker 2:
Around 60 km/h, maybe 62 or 63, but never exceeding 65. I try to stay within the speed limit.

Speaker 1:
So, you follow the current speed limit?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I try to stay within the traffic regulations.

Speaker 1:
If you exceed the speed limit, what happens?

Speaker 2:
Generally, there's a 10% tolerance. For example, if the limit is 60 km/h, you shouldn't exceed 66 km/h. So, I try to stay within that range.

Speaker 1:
What about on the highway?

Speaker 2:
On the highway, the limit is usually 120 km/h, but I might go up to 130 km/h.

Speaker 1:
How do you maintain a safe following distance?

Speaker 2:
I always try to keep a safe distance. This might sound a bit vague, but I want to have enough space to react in case the car in front stops suddenly or there's an emergency. I don't like to follow too closely.

Speaker 1:
You don't like tailgating?

Speaker 2:
Exactly. If the car in front stops suddenly, you need space to maneuver. You don't want to be stuck without an escape route.

Speaker 1:
Let's simulate a situation where there's a sudden stop in front. How would you react?
Speaker 1: You mentioned that you couldn't pull out the lever, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, that's correct. We might need to simulate this situation later if we have a video from the front.

Speaker 1: We can take a look at it. The key is to maintain a longer distance. In case of an emergency, it's less likely to result in a rear-end collision.

Speaker 2: Exactly. And if the car in front breaks down, you can maneuver out and change lanes safely.

Speaker 1: Yes, that's a good point. 

Speaker 2: I always pay attention to the right side.

Speaker 1: On our usual route, we noticed fewer cars on the auxiliary road today. How do you handle the transition in such cases?

Speaker 2: I usually let the other vehicles pass first.

Speaker 1: It's mostly a temporary adjustment process.

Speaker 2: Yes, especially when it's not during peak hours.

Speaker 1: When making a right turn, you mainly focus on the right side, correct?

Speaker 2: Yes, but I might not have checked the right side thoroughly earlier. Ideally, I should have, but I was also mindful of the passenger next to me. I didn't want to keep turning my head too much.

Speaker 1: Do you usually rely on the rearview mirror?

Speaker 2: Yes, I do.

Speaker 1: Did you encounter any traffic issues during your drive today?

Speaker 2: No, I didn't.

Speaker 1: In crowded areas like school entrances or hospitals, you need to slow down and be cautious.

Speaker 1: Were there any specific areas you paid extra attention to for safety during your drive?

Speaker 1: For instance, how do you handle sudden lane changes by other cars?

Speaker 2: If a car in front looks like it's about to make a U-turn, I slow down.

Speaker 1: You need to move forward a bit more.

Speaker 1: Earlier, you mentioned a large vehicle parked by the roadside.

Speaker 2: Yes, large vehicles can create blind spots. If someone suddenly appears, it can be dangerous.

Speaker 1: You seem very cautious about blind spots while driving.

Speaker 2: Absolutely. I pay extra attention in such areas because you never know when a cyclist, child, or animal might appear. 

Speaker 1: This car has been on this road for quite some time, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, it has.
Speaker 1: So, do you think this car has been on this road for a long time?

Speaker 2: Yes, it seems like it has been here for quite a while.

Speaker 1: I thought it suddenly appeared at the entrance. Maybe we need to be cautious at this intersection. Have you noticed that this is an intersection without traffic lights? This is actually a very important part of our experiment. For example, right now, there are no traffic lights.

Speaker 2: I understand what you mean. We need to proceed carefully.

Speaker 1: Exactly. Let's take it slow. Before we start, can you describe how you would handle an intersection without traffic lights?

Speaker 2: If you are turning right and I am turning left, in a situation without traffic lights, I would be more cautious and slow down. There are too many unpredictable factors. With traffic lights, it's more straightforwardâ€”you just follow the green light. But without traffic signals, cars can come from any direction, and you can't predict their speed. So, in such cases, it's better to be slower than if there were traffic lights.

Speaker 1: Besides slowing down, what else would you do?

Speaker 2: I would observe more carefully. I need to watch all four directions and be aware of pedestrians and other vehicles.

Speaker 1: What specific aspects would you observe?

Speaker 2: Well, if I'm going straight, I would first observe the left side because cars from the left would be the first to meet me. If I'm turning right, I would still check the left side first because those cars are the closest to me.

Speaker 1: So, you would check both the left and right sides?

Speaker 2: Yes, at an intersection, you need to be aware of both sides. If it's an open road, you can just glance left and right quickly. But in a more complex intersection, you need to be more thorough.

Speaker 1: Do you think there are any blind spots?

Speaker 2: Yes, that's quite normal in such situations.

Speaker 1: How about the distance to the car in front? Should we keep a certain distance?

Speaker 2: Yes, we should maintain a safe distance. In city traffic, you can't be too close. It should be closer than on a highway but still safe.

Speaker 1: Specifically, how many car lengths would you keep?

Speaker 2: About one car length.
**Speaker 1:**
How close do you usually keep to the car in front of you?

**Speaker 2:**
About one car length.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you maintain about one car length, even in the city or on the highway?

**Speaker 2:**
It depends on the speed and the specific situation. On smaller roads with a speed limit of around 60 km/h, I keep about one car length.

**Speaker 1:**
What about on the highway?

**Speaker 2:**
On the highway, the distance is longer.

**Speaker 1:**
For example, on the highway, there are markers for 50, 100, and 200 meters. Do you follow those distances?

**Speaker 2:**
Honestly, I don't have a precise concept of those markers. I just keep a safe distance within my control.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you don't keep too far or too close, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, not too far but not too close either.

**Speaker 1:**
Here, we need to turn right, and the left side has a green light. Do you observe the road conditions when turning?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I adapt based on the road conditions. I try to be flexible.

**Speaker 1:**
It seemed like you were checking the left side earlier.

**Speaker 2:**
In this case, I was mainly looking to the right.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, because we are turning right.

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly, we don't need to worry about the left side. We focus on the right turn.

**Speaker 1:**
There are more policies on the right side. Do you pay more attention to the road conditions?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I pay close attention to the road conditions and the traffic.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you focus on to ensure safe driving?

**Speaker 2:**
I focus on the cars and pedestrians on the road.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it's not just the road conditions but also your driving and safety measures?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I also check the car for any issues, like warning lights or other abnormalities. It's not just about the road but also the vehicle itself.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you think you can drive more safely?

**Speaker 2:**
First, ensure the car is in good condition. Then, observe the road carefully and maintain a steady speed according to the road conditions. Especially at intersections, slow down and be extra cautious.
**Speaker 1:**
When we need to make a left turn, can you describe the process?

**Speaker 2:**
For a left turn, you need to be aware of traffic from both directions. Yes, both left and right.

**Speaker 1:**
There are usually fewer left turns, but the road conditions are unknown. So, you mainly check the left side first, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Even if thereâ€™s no traffic, you still need to be cautious and proceed carefully.

**Speaker 2:**
Actually, it might also be related to my personality. If someone else is in the car, I might behave differently. When I'm alone, I check both sides thoroughly. But with someone else, I might not look as much.

**Speaker 1:**
You feel a bit awkward looking to the right, donâ€™t you?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, thereâ€™s a bit of that.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it.

**Speaker 2:**
But generally, I do check both sides. Itâ€™s a normal practice for me.

**Speaker 1:**
Have you ever encountered any situations while driving that made you particularly scared?

**Speaker 2:**
Well, I havenâ€™t really faced many such situations. Also, Iâ€™m quite familiar with my car, so I donâ€™t get overly nervous. Some people might get very anxious, but I stay calm. Even if itâ€™s a new car, I adapt quickly. Itâ€™s like riding a bike for me. In unexpected situations, I stay composed and donâ€™t panic. I donâ€™t slam on the brakes suddenly; I handle it smoothly.

**Speaker 1:**
I see.

**Speaker 2:**
Everyone has to deal with unexpected situations, but I remain calm. Some people might get startled, but I donâ€™t. I handle it with a steady mindset and use the brakes appropriately.

**Speaker 1:**
I wanted to ask about your braking technique. How do you handle sudden stops or emergencies?

**Speaker 2:**
Iâ€™ve never had to slam on the brakes. I always brake smoothly and gradually.

**Speaker 1:**
Not necessarily slamming, but how do you react to sudden loud noises or unexpected events?

**Speaker 2:**
In such cases, I remain calm and handle the situation without panicking.
Speaker 1:
Not a sudden stop, for example, just now we heard a loud noise, and suddenly someone appeared. I want to ask about your evaluation of this situation.

Speaker 2:
In such cases, I would say the key word is stability. It's about maintaining control.

Speaker 1:
By stability, do you mean the car's assistant systems?

Speaker 2:
Including the brakes. It's not about slamming the brakes hard. It's more about controlled braking, not a sudden, harsh stop. It's about braking within a short period but not abruptly.

Speaker 1:
So, it's about braking within a short time but not in one go.

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly.

Speaker 1:
Is it about gradual braking?

Speaker 2:
Yes, gradually.

Speaker 1:
Do you use the steering wheel to avoid obstacles?

Speaker 2:
I don't usually rely on the steering wheel.

Speaker 1:
You typically slow down to avoid obstacles?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I might slightly adjust the steering wheel, but I won't make sudden, sharp turns. It's more about slight adjustments.

Speaker 1:
So, your main approach is to slow down?

Speaker 2:
Yes, slowing down. I might slightly adjust the steering wheel, but I won't make sudden, sharp turns because there might be something on the side.

Speaker 1:
So, you're not afraid of these situations, but you pay special attention to them?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I usually anticipate and make judgments in advance.

Speaker 1:
What are some specific situations you pay special attention to?

Speaker 2:
For example, when there are cars in front or obstacles blocking the view.

Speaker 1:
Obstacles blocking the view?

Speaker 2:
Yes, when there are cars or other obstacles in front, you need to slow down.

Speaker 1:
So, you slow down when there's a blind spot?

Speaker 2:
Yes, and also at intersections without traffic lights.

Speaker 1:
Hmm, I see.

Speaker 2:
Other situations might include curves or when going downhill, where the view is not straight. In such cases, you need to be prepared and stay highly focused.

Speaker 1:
So, it's not about being scared, but being cautious?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly.

Speaker 1:
Look at this entrance; there are quite a few cars here.

Speaker 1:
Can you describe a situation where you saw a lot of vehicles on the road?
Speaker 1:
Take a look at this entrance; there are actually quite a few cars here.

Speaker 1:
Can you describe your experience? We see a lot of fast-moving cars on the road. Please recall your experience.

Speaker 2:
Sure, I always check if there are any cars. If there aren't any cars or people, I tend to drive faster. If the situation allows, I accelerate through.

Speaker 1:
So, you accelerate through, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I quickly pass through if the conditions allow.

Speaker 1:
I want to ask, what are the conditions for you to accelerate through?

Speaker 2:
The condition is that there are no cars or people. If the road is clear, I accelerate.

Speaker 1:
If there are cars or people, what do you do?

Speaker 2:
If there are cars or people, I definitely wait.

Speaker 1:
Today, do you think there are many cars and people? Based on your standards, would you accelerate through?

Speaker 2:
No, I wouldn't accelerate through.

Speaker 1:
So, you would slow down. I noticed you turned into the middle lane without much consideration. Do you usually do that?

Speaker 2:
Yes, but only if there are no cars. Yesterday, there were no cars, so I turned directly.

Speaker 1:
Are you aware that we can adjust this activity? Also, I have a couple more questions. Do you often overtake other cars?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I do have a habit of overtaking.

Speaker 1:
Can you describe your overtaking habits?

Speaker 2:
If the car in front is blocking the lane, I definitely overtake because it can cause more traffic behind. In Beijing, the pace is fast, and there are many cars, so everyone tries to move forward. If you drive slowly, others will cut in front of you. So, I try not to leave too much space in front of me.

Speaker 1:
Oh, you try not to leave space. If the car in front is slow, you overtake, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I prefer to overtake on the left because the visibility is better.

Speaker 1:
That's allowed, right?
Speaker 1:
Have you ever had to overtake another vehicle?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I have. But I try to overtake from the left side whenever possible because the visibility is better.

Speaker 1:
The visibility is better on the left side.

Speaker 2:
Yes, that's the main reason. However, it also depends on the situation. Sometimes, the right side might be more suitable, depending on the road conditions.

Speaker 1:
So, you do overtake from the right side sometimes?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I do. It depends on the situation.

Speaker 1:
When overtaking from the left, what kind of situations make you decide to overtake? What do you look out for?

Speaker 2:
If the car in my lane is moving slowly and the left lane is faster, I will consider changing lanes to overtake. I always check my rearview mirror to see if there are any cars behind me and also check the side mirror to ensure it's safe to overtake.

Speaker 1:
What are some of your bad driving habits that might be dangerous?

Speaker 2:
Sometimes, I glance at my phone, which is not a good habit. Also, when I look to the right, it might make others uncomfortable because they might think I'm not paying attention. But I'm actually checking the right-side mirror. Other than that, I don't think I have many bad habits.

Speaker 1:
So, when you look to the right, it might make passengers feel uneasy?

Speaker 2:
Yes, they might feel uneasy because they think I'm not paying attention. But I'm just checking the mirror. Also, I try to avoid looking at my phone to stay focused.

Speaker 1:
What makes you feel uncomfortable when you're a passenger in someone else's car?

Speaker 2:
I feel uncomfortable when the driver accelerates or brakes suddenly. It feels unsafe.

Speaker 1:
Yes, sudden acceleration and braking can be unsettling. Safety is important.

Speaker 2:
I also feel uneasy when the driver is going too fast, especially near intersections or when there are other cars around.

Speaker 1:
Do you pay attention to your passengers' comfort when you drive?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I do. I try to make sure they are comfortable.

Speaker 1:
Can you give some examples of how you ensure passenger comfort?

Speaker 2:
It depends on the passenger. Some prefer a faster ride, while others prefer a slower pace. Some might want the windows open. I try to accommodate their preferences.
**Speaker 1:**
So, regarding driving, some people prefer to drive fast, while others prefer to drive slowly. Some might want to open the window, or listen to music. In normal circumstances, if no one asks, the windows remain closed.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, driving should primarily follow road safety and traffic laws, with passenger comfort being secondary.

**Speaker 1:**
Is this related to your job?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, safety comes first, followed by passenger comfort. Safety is always the priority.

**Speaker 1:**
Are you an administrative driver?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, more or less. Actually, I am a dedicated driver for a leader.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you specifically drive for a leader and pay close attention to their needs?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I try to gauge their comfort based on my intuition.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you ensure the leader's comfort? Do you rely on your intuition?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I try to understand their preferences in various aspects.

**Speaker 1:**
When driving the leader, do you take any special measures to ensure their comfort?

**Speaker 2:**
Sometimes I ask them directly.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you ask proactively?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, sometimes I do.

**Speaker 1:**
In your driving, do you take any special care to ensure their comfort?

**Speaker 2:**
Regardless of who it is, I always aim to ensure the passenger's comfort. My driving style is generally fast but stable. I make sure to take turns and stop smoothly, so the ride is comfortable and not jerky.

**Speaker 1:**
So, when driving the leader, you also drive quickly but ensure stability?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the overall travel time is short, but the ride is stable.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think you have any bad driving habits that might make passengers uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really.

**Speaker 1:**
Or when you are a passenger, what kind of driving makes you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Jerky driving, like sudden braking or rapid acceleration.

**Speaker 1:**
Jerky driving during starts and stops?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, and during turns as well.
Speaker 1: The car was jerking a lot, with sudden braking and abrupt starts.

Speaker 2: Yes, it was jerking during starts and stops.

Speaker 1: Was it also jerking during turns? Does that mean the turns were too sharp?

Speaker 2: Yes, some turns were too sharp, and it also happened when stopping or entering a corner.

Speaker 1: When you take a turn, do you maintain a steady speed?

Speaker 2: Whether I'm stopping or moving, I always try to be very steady. It feels almost like sitting on a trainâ€”very smooth.

Speaker 1: So, you take turns smoothly?

Speaker 2: Yes, I take turns very smoothly.

Speaker 1: How do you maintain that smoothness? What elements do you consider?

Speaker 2: I usually reduce the car's speed and take wider turns instead of sharp ones.

Speaker 1: Oh, you prefer wider turns.

Speaker 1: I have another question. What do you think makes a good or professional driver? What should a professional driver aim to achieve?

Speaker 2: Are we talking strictly about driving?

Speaker 1: Yes, about driving.

Speaker 2: I think safety is the most important. Drive slowly and steadily. It's better to be cautious and smooth.

Speaker 1: In sudden situations, like the ones you encounter while driving professionally, what do you think you need to do?

Speaker 2: Well, if we're just talking about driving, my job involves more than just driving. Driving is a small part of it. The rest involves dealing with people and situations. But when it comes to driving, no matter who the boss is, they prefer a steady and safe ride. It makes them feel secure.

Speaker 1: What do you think is the biggest difference between a professional driver and a new driver?

Speaker 2: I think the difference lies in experience on the road.

Speaker 1: Can you give a specific example?

Speaker 2: For instance, in unexpected situations, a new driver might panic because they haven't encountered it before. They might get flustered.

Speaker 1: And an experienced driver?

Speaker 2: An experienced driver would remain calm and composed. They know how to handle such situations better.

Speaker 1: With the development of autonomous cars, what do you think are the aspects where they can never match human drivers?

Speaker 2: I think...
**Speaker 1:**
Many self-driving cars are in development. What do you think about them?

**Speaker 2:**
I think no matter how advanced they get, they can never fully replace humans. They can only serve as an aid, but not a 100% replacement. That would go against some fundamental principles.

**Speaker 1:**
In what aspects do you think they fall short?

**Speaker 2:**
At least in terms of handling unexpected situations. For planned routes and tasks, they might be fine. But for sudden changes, like altering the route midway or making spontaneous decisions, humans are more flexible. For instance, if I decide to go somewhere else or return home for some reason, a human can adapt more directly to these sudden changes.

**Speaker 1:**
For example, in what situations?

**Speaker 2:**
For instance, detecting obstacles is not an issue because of advanced sensors and technology. They might even detect things that humans can't see. But for spontaneous human decisions, like changing destinations or tasks, self-driving cars can't match human adaptability.

**Speaker 1:**
So, for sudden plans, like deciding where to go or making quick decisions?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. Whether it's deciding to stop somewhere or changing plans midway, these are areas where machines have limitations. They are still rigid compared to human flexibility.

**Speaker 1:**
They can't handle these sudden changes.

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly, especially when it comes to unexpected situations on the road.

**Speaker 1:**
On the road, do you think they can handle it?

**Speaker 2:**
On the road, as long as there are no unexpected obstacles, they should be fine.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you judge the intentions of other drivers or pedestrians while driving? Like predicting how a car will move or how a person will walk?

**Speaker 2:**
It's difficult to predict accurately. In areas with children playing, for example, it's important to drive slowly and keep a safe distance. You can't always predict their actions, so it's better to stay cautious and keep your distance.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you don't deliberately try to predict their behavior?

**Speaker 2:**
I do try to predict, but there's always uncertainty. So, it's best to stay cautious and keep a safe distance.

**Speaker 1:**
What about other cars?

**Speaker 2:**
With other cars, it's somewhat easier, but still, you need to be cautious and maintain a safe distance.
Speaker 1:
So, how do you make judgments while driving?

Speaker 2:
Well, it depends on the situation. For instance, today, it's better to keep a safe distance, right?

Speaker 1:
What about the car itself?

Speaker 2:
The car? It's manageable. You just need to control it properly.

Speaker 1:
How do you make judgments?

Speaker 2:
The car has various systems, like lane-keeping and speed limits. You just need to follow normal driving procedures. If there's an unexpected situation, you need to handle it accordingly.

Speaker 1:
Let me give you an example. Suppose there's a car parked on the side of the road. It might suddenly move or stay put. In such cases, we don't consider the usual traffic rules, right?

Speaker 2:
In such situations, it's best to slow down and pass cautiously. Just reduce your speed and proceed carefully.

Speaker 1:
What if we encounter a traffic signal and some cars have stopped? Should we let them go first or proceed ourselves?

Speaker 2:
In such cases, I usually let others go first. If they don't move, then I proceed.

Speaker 1:
So, you prefer to let others go first?

Speaker 2:
Yes, that's generally my approach.

Speaker 1:
But what if you're unsure whether the other driver will let you go?

Speaker 2:
In uncertain situations, it's best to be cautious and proceed slowly. You need to gauge the other driver's intentions.

Speaker 1:
So, you move slowly to show your intentions and see how the other driver reacts?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. You proceed slowly and observe the other driver's actions.

Speaker 1:
It's hard to describe this feeling precisely.

Speaker 2:
Yes, it's something you learn with experience. You need to be flexible and adapt to the situation.

Speaker 1:
It's difficult to explain. For example, when we focus on a car's movement, we pay attention to its speed and direction. How do you judge its intentions?

Speaker 2:
You can observe the car's behavior at intersections. If it's moving slowly, you can proceed a bit faster.

Speaker 1:
So, if the other car is moving slowly, you speed up to pass it?

Speaker 2:
Yes, that's right.
Speaker 1:
If the car in front is moving slowly, you should speed up a bit.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I would just overtake it. If the car is moving fast, I would adjust my speed to avoid a collision.

Speaker 1:
Earlier, you mentioned a situation where you were making a left turn, and there was a car going straight on the left side and another car making a left turn on the right side. In such a scenario, if both of you slow down and stop to let each other pass, but then neither of you moves, what would you do?

Speaker 2:
If the conditions allow, I would proceed. If not, I would wait.

Speaker 1:
Can you specify what conditions you consider to determine if you can proceed?

Speaker 2:
For example, if the other car stops and there is enough space for me to pass, I would go ahead. It's all about the available space.

Speaker 1:
So, it's mainly about the space.

Speaker 2:
Yes, to avoid congestion.

Speaker 1:
You mentioned overtaking to avoid congestion. Do you usually speed up or overtake in such situations?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I do.

Speaker 1:
Besides motor vehicles, there are also many non-motorized vehicles on the road. How do you judge their movements?

Speaker 2:
I observe and ask questions if needed.

Speaker 1:
When you observe, what do you look for?

Speaker 2:
For example, with delivery vehicles, I try to maintain a safe distance.

Speaker 1:
How do you judge their movements?

Speaker 2:
I try to keep a safe distance from them, especially in areas with a lot of non-motorized vehicles. If I can avoid them, I will.

Speaker 1:
Do you pay attention to the movements of both motorized and non-motorized vehicles?

Speaker 2:
Yes, especially in residential or commercial areas where vehicles are likely to turn or stop. On main roads, I don't pay as much attention to them unless necessary.
Speaker 1: When driving normally, especially in areas like intersections, residential neighborhoods, or commercial zones, we often encounter situations where we need to avoid conflicts with other vehicles and pedestrians, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, exactly. In such scenarios, we don't always have to give way to others if we're on the main road. We just need to be cautious and not overly concerned about them.

Speaker 1: But sometimes, we do encounter vehicles going the wrong way.

Speaker 2: Yes, wrong-way driving does happen, but it's less common on main roads.

Speaker 1: Actually, it happens quite often, even on main roads.

Speaker 2: Really? I thought it was more common on side roads. In any case, we need to be courteous and give way to non-motorized vehicles as per traffic regulations.

Speaker 1: Yes, especially when dealing with wrong-way drivers.

Speaker 2: There's not much we can do about it. We just have to be as accommodating as possible.

Speaker 1: For instance, I wanted to ask about how to judge the behavior of other drivers or pedestrians, especially when there are no clear rules.

Speaker 2: We definitely need to make judgments in such situations.

Speaker 1: Right, but how do we make accurate judgments? It's hard to describe.

Speaker 2: We rely on our eyes to observe the overall situation.

Speaker 1: For example, when you see a pedestrian or another vehicle, how do you determine their next move?

Speaker 2: You have to look at the overall context. It's not about focusing on one specific point.

Speaker 1: So, you mean observing their general direction and movement?

Speaker 2: Yes, for pedestrians, you might look at where their head is turned to gauge their direction.

Speaker 1: It's challenging to describe these observations.

Speaker 2: This is just my personal approach. Everyone might have different methods.

Speaker 1: We hope to understand these methods better.

Speaker 2: Some people might focus on different cues, like foot movement. It's all about what works for you. For non-motorized vehicles, it's similar; you observe the person controlling it.
Speaker 1: When it comes to non-skill-based driving, it's similar. The driver controls the vehicle, but you can't see inside. You can only see the driver turning the wheel and the direction of the front wheels, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, you can only see the direction the wheels are turning. It's hard to judge anything else. It's like trying to explore the unknown.

Speaker 1: What time did you have lunch today?

Speaker 2: Today, I had lunch around 12:30 PM before coming here. I arrived around 1 PM.

Speaker 1: Did you have any coffee?

Speaker 2: No, I don't usually drink coffee or any other beverages like that.

Speaker 1: Do you smoke?

Speaker 2: No, I don't smoke. I also don't take any medication regularly.

Speaker 1: This is relevant to today's test, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, it might affect the demonstration.

Speaker 1: So, there's no influence from caffeine or any other stimulants?

Speaker 2: No, none at all. No caffeine or any nerve-related medications.

Speaker 1: Okay, and we're still recording.

Speaker 2: Yes, that's fine.

Speaker 1: If you need to write something down, feel free.

Speaker 2: It feels a bit like playing a game.

Speaker 1: Are you comfortable with this?

Speaker 2: Yes, I think I'm mentally prepared for it.

Speaker 1: You know what to expect.

Speaker 2: Yes, I'm aware of the situation. We're working on autonomous driving technology, right? We're combining research with practical applications.

Speaker 1: Exactly.

Speaker 2: We've been testing simple prototypes for years now. The cars are the same color.

Speaker 1: This isn't based on Beijing time, is it?

Speaker 2: No, we don't need to add that. If it's clear, it's fine.

Speaker 1: If you can make it clear, then...

Speaker 2: No need to add it. I'll just write "none." I'm not currently working.

Speaker 1: That's fine.

Speaker 2: It doesn't matter if I sleep or not. The tax deduction isn't significant. I understand what you mean.

Speaker 1: After the 27th...

Speaker 2: He might be worried about being seen by someone.

Speaker 1: You were in the wrong lane earlier. You should have been in the other lane.

Speaker 2: Where? I didn't notice.

Speaker 1: It might have been something you learned earlier. Let's move on to the next part.
Speaker 1:
You might be referring to the one we just talked about.

Speaker 2:
Where did you see it? Not sure, right?

Speaker 1:
It could be something we just learned about, or maybe the next one.

Speaker 1:
Starting at the eleven-minute mark.

Speaker 1:
It can't be the Land Rover and YY.

Speaker 1:
There are three minutes left.

Speaker 1:
Click on this one as we pass by.

Speaker 1:
Oh, it might be this one, not going abroad. Yeah, it's possible. Actually, the points passengers consider are quite similar.

Speaker 2:
Some people might think so.

Speaker 1:
Because he didn't do much, he just came to give you feedback.

Speaker 2:
Then he checks if there is anything.

Speaker 1:
Yes, the points he focuses on might be different. Interaction is fine.

Speaker 1:
Oh, right, making a U-turn. Maybe during the dispatch process, we might not see the full video, but we should get a general idea. This must be during the marketing review process. Okay.

Speaker 1:
So, I'll drop you off there.
