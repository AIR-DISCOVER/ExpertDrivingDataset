Speaker 1:
Today's session is divided into two parts, with one part above.

Speaker 1:
Oh, right, I didn't bring that manual. It's on the driver's side, and then give me both of those because there's also that old form that needs to be filled out. So, give me both of those.

Speaker 1:
Okay, no problem. Are you going to sit for a while? Just wait a bit, and after the two of them arrive, I'll start driving. No problem.

Speaker 2:
No problem, no rush. Yes.

Speaker 1:
In the evening, you'll see this screen with a 360-degree full-angle video. Yes, it captures everything around you. I might ask you some questions about your usual driving habits and your actions at that time. We can watch the video and discuss why you made certain decisions. Yes, exactly.

Speaker 1:
Hello, what's up? Where's that manual? Is it on the shelf? On the shelf with the folders, doc? It's not in your hand today? Didn't I give it to you? Maybe it's in the car; I didn't take that manual later.

Speaker 1:
Alright, so should we test this microphone?

Speaker 1:
Bring it closer, let me see. Got it, yes, hello, okay.

Speaker 1:
We can look at this screen. Is this the official start of our interview? Okay, my name is Chang Xiang, and I'll be responsible for the final interview session today. We'll watch a video recorded with the panoramic camera on the car roof, and explore your driving habits. We can pause the video anytime to discuss any interesting or extra judgments or actions you made. Feel free to stop and discuss at any time, and I'll do the same. Just think of it as a casual chat, no need to be nervous. If I ask any questions you don't want to answer or find sensitive, just let me know, and I won't ask further. All the records today will be handled anonymously, and we won't disclose your personal information. Let's start with some simple questions since you are a professional driver. What types of vehicles have you driven? Gasoline cars, electric cars, and SUVs?
**Interviewer:** Let's start with some basic questions. Since you are a professional driver, could you tell me what types of vehicles you have driven? For example, gasoline cars, electric cars, SUVs, sedans, off-road vehicles, etc.

**Driver:** I've driven almost all types of vehicles, from large buses with 50 to 60 seats, 12-meter-long buses, to both automatic and manual cars. I've driven brands like Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Bentley, and Rolls-Royce. Basically, all kinds of vehicles.

**Interviewer:** Have you driven electric cars in recent years?

**Driver:** Yes, I have driven electric cars, but not as frequently. I have driven fewer electric cars compared to gasoline cars.

**Interviewer:** Which electric cars have you driven?

**Driver:** Just some basic models from popular brands. I haven't driven many electric cars.

**Interviewer:** Were these electric cars for your job or personal use?

**Driver:** They were mostly personal or friends' cars, not for my job.

**Interviewer:** I see, so you've driven them less frequently. In your many years of driving experience, have you driven cars with advanced driver-assistance systems? For example, adaptive cruise control, automatic start-stop, lane-keeping assist, etc.

**Driver:** Yes, I have driven cars with all those features.

**Interviewer:** Can we talk about your experience using these features? Maybe you can share a specific instance that left an impression on you.

**Driver:** For example, the Mercedes S450 I currently drive has features like automatic start-stop and active braking. It has an active braking system.

**Interviewer:** Active braking means it detects when you're too close to the car in front and automatically applies the brakes, right?

**Driver:** Yes, if you don't react in time, the main camera detects the distance and automatically applies the brakes. However, for experienced drivers like me, I find these features somewhat redundant. My habit now is to turn off the automatic start-stop as soon as I get in the car.

**Interviewer:** Why do you turn off the automatic start-stop?

**Driver:** Because I don't think it saves fuel, and I believe it wears out the starter motor more quickly.

**Interviewer:** Wait, what do you mean by it doesn't save fuel?

**Driver:** The purpose of automatic start-stop is supposed to be fuel-saving and environmentally friendly, right? That's the initial design intention, I believe.

**Interviewer:** I understand automatic start-stop as a feature that turns off the engine at red lights to save fuel.

**Driver:** Yes, it turns off the engine when the car stops and restarts it when you move again. It's meant to save fuel and reduce emissions. But in my experience, it doesn't really save fuel.
Speaker 1: One reason is that it doesn't consume fuel quickly, and it doesn't cause pollution or emissions. I think that was the original intention, but for us, I feel that automatic start-stop doesn't save much fuel and can significantly damage the car's starter. The starter is frequently activated, which consumes a lot of power. So, for us older drivers, we usually turn off the automatic start-stop feature as soon as we get in the car. For example, in my S450, I also turn off the active braking system.

Speaker 2: Why do you turn off the active braking system?

Speaker 1: The reason we turn off the active braking system is that experienced drivers like us can accurately judge the distance to the car in front and the pedestrians around us. We can make our own decisions based on the road conditions. However, if you don't turn off the active braking system, it can suddenly activate without warning, startling both the passengers and the driver. This can lead to rear-end collisions because the car behind you doesn't expect you to brake suddenly.

Speaker 2: Exactly. The system's judgment criteria are much stricter than what most people would consider reasonable.

Speaker 1: For example, if I'm driving and there's a car or an electric bike coming towards me from five or six meters away, I can use my driving experience to avoid it or slow down slightly. But the system might interpret this as me not taking any action and will suddenly apply the brakes very forcefully. This can be very uncomfortable and can easily cause a rear-end collision. I once asked the dealership if they could permanently disable this feature for me, but they said it can't be turned off permanently. You have to manually disable it every time you start the car. They also mentioned that the rate of rear-end collisions is quite high for cars with this feature.

Speaker 2: Are there any other features like this?

Speaker 1: Yes, like cruise control and lane-keeping assist.

Speaker 2: Have you used them before?

Speaker 1: I use cruise control when I'm driving long distances on the highway, but I don't use lane-keeping assist.

Speaker 2: Why don't you use lane-keeping assist?

Speaker 1: It's just a personal habit. If you rely on too many automated features, it can make you feel more fatigued.
**Speaker 1:** Based on our personal habits, if you use all the features, it can completely free you up, but that can easily lead to fatigue.

**Speaker 2:** I understand.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, because when you completely relax, you don't need to be active. Actually, we don't use cruise control much, just occasionally.

**Speaker 2:** Some drivers have shared with me that they find driving an automatic can make them sleepy, while a manual keeps them more alert.

**Speaker 1:** That's true. With a manual, as long as you're operating it, your hands and feet are always moving. Understand?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, got it. So, do you usually drive more short distances or long distances?

**Speaker 1:** Mostly short distances, but I do drive long distances quite often. I'm from Shandong, so I drive back home a few times a year during holidays. So, I drive frequently.

**Speaker 2:** After this driving experience, how do you feel about our vehicle? How does it drive?

**Speaker 1:** The vehicle itself feels fine. It's a high-end car, so there's not much to complain about. However, the dashboard indicates that it needs maintenance. Also, when driving, the glasses...

**Speaker 2:** They can be a bit obstructive.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, especially with a hat on.

**Speaker 2:** It pulls from the back, but it's manageable. You don't need to make big head movements, but the glasses can still obstruct your view.

**Speaker 1:** Understood. Have you had any traffic accidents? This might be a sensitive question.

**Speaker 2:** No problem. Honestly, over the years, I haven't had any accidents where I was at fault. From my time in the military to now, I drive about 60,000 kilometers a year on average, and I've never had a major accident. The biggest accident I had caused about 10,000 yuan in damage, and it wasn't my fault.

**Speaker 1:** Was it a rear-end collision?

**Speaker 2:** No, it was a head-on collision. I was going straight, and the other driver made a left turn and hit me.

**Speaker 1:** So, they hit your left front side?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:** Since you're a professional driver, can you share some experiences of driving important passengers?

**Speaker 2:** Sure, driving important passengers...

**Speaker 1:** From your resume, I see you started in the military, then worked for a team leader, and after leaving the military, you continued driving for leaders or...

**Speaker 2:** Yes, for bosses. Now, I'm a business driver. What aspect of being a business driver are you interested in?
Speaker 2:
As a chauffeur for executives, I understand you might want to know about different aspects of this role.

Speaker 1:
I'm particularly interested in what you pay special attention to when driving important passengers.

Speaker 2:
Are you more interested in the driving aspect or the service aspect? Essentially, which side of the service are you focusing on?

Speaker 1:
By service, I mean everything beyond just driving.

Speaker 2:
Including the journey itself, right?

Speaker 1:
Yes, our focus on service is more about...

Speaker 2:
The driving experience, correct? As a chauffeur for executives, you can't drive like a taxi driver or an ordinary driver. The first priority is to be cautious. When driving, especially with an executive on board, you need to drive smoothly. If the executive isn't in the car, you might drive faster, but with them, you must drive steadily. This includes starting, stopping, lane changes, and turns. The key is to be smooth.

Speaker 2:
Additionally, you need to plan your route in advance. Know where you're going, the best route to take, and any specific characteristics of the roads. This requires careful planning and analysis. Driving for an executive demands attention to detail. It's about how you interpret and apply these principles over the years.

Speaker 1:
Regarding specific driving operations, for instance, when an executive or important passenger is on board...

Speaker 2:
As I mentioned, you need to drive smoothly. Accelerate and brake gently. When turning or changing lanes, do it slowly to avoid any jerky movements that might make the passenger uncomfortable. The main goal is to ensure a smooth ride.

Speaker 1:
Alright, let's look at the video from our experiment today. I'll start by asking you about your usual driving habits. For instance, can you tell me about your habits when making a turn? Let's start with right turns since we often begin with those.

Speaker 2:
When making a turn, you need to be aware of the surroundings. For a right turn, I always check the pedestrian crossing to see if anyone is coming, and I also check the left side for any oncoming vehicles. This ensures a safe turn into the new lane.
Speaker 1:
First, check if there are any cars coming from the left because I need to make a right turn and enter the lane in front of the pedestrian crossing. Yes, I need to see if there are any cars coming from the left.

Speaker 2:
Yes, you should first check the pedestrian crossing, then look to the left after that. Check the left side of the motor vehicle lane to see if any cars are coming.

Speaker 1:
Right, exactly. In this area, there are barriers separating the lanes, so I don't need to check for oncoming traffic from the opposite side. But if there were no barriers...

Speaker 2:
There might be cars turning left.

Speaker 1:
Yes, you need to check for that. Normally, you should have already checked everything.

Speaker 2:
Yes, and you should also check the right corner for pedestrians.

Speaker 1:
Do you check for pedestrians at the corner?

Speaker 2:
Yes, definitely.

Speaker 1:
And what about the side mirrors? When do you check them?

Speaker 2:
I stop checking them once I start turning. But during the turn, I need to check if there are any pedestrians or vehicles coming from the right.

Speaker 1:
So, the sequence is to first check the pedestrian crossing, then look for oncoming traffic from the left.

Speaker 2:
Yes, once I see that there are no cars on the pedestrian crossing and from the left, I start to make the right turn. While turning, I also check if there are any vehicles or pedestrians coming from the right.

Speaker 1:
So, when you start moving, you check if there are any non-motorized vehicles on the right.

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. I check simultaneously.

Speaker 1:
This was our first right turn after leaving the parking lot. Can you describe how you handled it?

Speaker 2:
When approaching this area, the first thing to check is the zebra crossing. Look for pedestrians on both sides. If there are no pedestrians, proceed slowly. When you reach the main road, check for pedestrians and cyclists on both sides.

Speaker 1:
Yes, exactly.

Speaker 2:
Basically, you should be in a near-stop state, allowing others to pass and observing the surroundings. When your car's front end comes out, pedestrians and cyclists on the right will usually yield because they are going against the flow. However, electric bikes on the left side usually won't yield. They almost never do.

Speaker 1:
Because...

Speaker 2:
They think they have the right of way and that you are slow. Even if they curse, they will still try to get ahead of you. So, you need to move slowly and be ready to yield.

Speaker 1:
So, you move slowly and be ready to yield at any moment.

Speaker 2:
Yes, move slowly and be prepared to brake at any time.

Speaker 1:
Got it.

Speaker 2:
Yes, because if you don't yield, they will squeeze past you.
Speaker 1:
So, today you were driving behind another car, and several non-motorized vehicles gave way to you.

Speaker 2:
Not exactly. It's not that they gave way; there was enough distance between us. I had enough space to maneuver, you understand?

Speaker 1:
So, they didn't compete with you for the road.

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. Based on the speed of both vehicles, I could tell if I could pass or not.

Speaker 1:
So, you judge your speed and the speed of the oncoming non-motorized vehicles.

Speaker 2:
Yes, to see if I can make the turn.

Speaker 1:
You assess if you have enough time to complete the turn. If you do, you proceed without worrying about them.

Speaker 2:
Yes, if they are faster than me, I let them go, like those delivery guys who ride very fast. Even if they seem far away, their speed means you can't compete with them. In such cases, you stop and let them pass.

Speaker 1:
When their speed is too fast, even if they are far away, you still give way.

Speaker 2:
Yes, you judge based on their speed whether you can pass or not.

Speaker 1:
So, the time window is very short. How do you handle oncoming non-motorized vehicles going the wrong way?

Speaker 2:
I slightly move to the right, checking if there are pedestrians or electric bikes on my right.

Speaker 1:
If there aren't any, you can move slightly to the right.

Speaker 2:
Yes, but not too much. Just enough to let them pass.

Speaker 1:
I noticed you are very good at judging the distance on your left.

Speaker 2:
Yes, it's very close.

Speaker 1:
I really think so.

Speaker 2:
Your perspective from outside the car is different from mine inside the car. The viewing angles and distances are different.

Speaker 1:
So, there's still a few centimeters of distance.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I make sure to leave enough space for them to pass. It might look close, but there's actually a decent gap. Also, there are electric bikes on your right. You can't squeeze them out of the way. In such situations, I usually flash my headlights.

Speaker 1:
You flashed your headlights earlier.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I should have flashed my headlights.

Speaker 1:
So, from the oncoming vehicle's perspective...

Speaker 2:
They can't see the headlights. When there's an oncoming vehicle going the wrong way, I usually flash my headlights to alert them. They then move to the side, and I adjust accordingly.

Speaker 1:
Even during the day, you flash your headlights?

Speaker 2:
Yes, definitely. 

Speaker 1:
Why do you choose to use headlights instead of the horn?

Speaker 2:
Because headlights are more noticeable when we are facing each other.
**Speaker 1:**
Even during the day, you would use your high beams, right? Why do you choose to use high beams instead of the horn?

**Speaker 2:**
Because high beams are the most noticeable. When we are approaching each other, the high beams are the most visible. The horn might not be heard, especially if the other person is riding an electric bike with a helmet on, or if there's wind noise. The high beams are more effective and provide a more direct warning.

**Speaker 1:**
Oh, I see. Got it. Let's continue. So, you mean when you were approaching, you flashed your high beams?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I flashed my high beams and slightly moved to the right. The other person would instinctively move to the right as well.

**Speaker 1:**
I noticed you moved to the right, but it seemed like you were steering to the left.

**Speaker 2:**
That's because the other vehicle was already coming, and since it was going to turn right, I anticipated it.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you moved to the left to avoid being in its path?

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly. There's no need to follow it closely; you need to anticipate its movement.

**Speaker 1:**
And then there's an intersection where you enter the main road. What is your usual habit when merging from a side road to a main road?

**Speaker 2:**
I use the turn signal, slow down, and check the rearview mirror. In such situations, the rearview mirror might not show if there's a car coming because of the bushes blocking the view.

**Speaker 1:**
Because the bushes are blocking the view?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, so you can't just turn sharply. You need to gradually merge and be cautious.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you mean you can't just turn sharply here?

**Speaker 2:**
Correct, you can't just turn sharply.

**Speaker 1:**
You need to move forward a bit and then gradually merge.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, move forward a bit and then gradually merge. This way, you can clearly see if there's a car behind you.

**Speaker 1:**
At that moment, there was a bus behind you, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, a bus.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you let it pass, or did you decide to merge?

**Speaker 2:**
If I could merge safely, I would gradually merge.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it. And this section is a straight road with good conditions. What is your usual habit when driving on such a road? Do you maintain a steady speed or accelerate?

**Speaker 2:**
I follow the speed limit.

**Speaker 1:**
The speed limit here is 60.

**Speaker 2:**
I usually don't exceed 40. I maintain a speed of around 40, which is below the speed limit. I keep an eye on the side mirrors, even if the left side is just a barrier.
In the given scenario, the driver maintains the maximum speed limit and consistently checks the side mirrors, even though the left side only has a barrier.

Speaker 1:
You habitually check both sides?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I mainly check the right side to see if any car is trying to overtake me.

Speaker 1:
If a car tries to overtake you, what do you do?

Speaker 2:
I maintain a constant speed. If there's space ahead, they can overtake me.

Speaker 1:
You don't intentionally slow down to let them pass?

Speaker 2:
No, there's no need to slow down intentionally because there's plenty of space ahead.

Speaker 1:
You use the left mirror to check the distance between your car and the one behind you?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I use the left mirror to see if a car is following closely behind.

Speaker 1:
And the right mirror to check if a car is trying to overtake you?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. 

Speaker 1:
I noticed you tend to drive on the left side of the lane. Why is that?

Speaker 2:
It's a habit. It gives me a sense of security because the left side has a barrier and no pedestrians, unlike the right side. If I drive too close to the right, it might give the impression that I'm about to change lanes.

Speaker 1:
So, you don't want other drivers to think you're changing lanes?

Speaker 2:
Yes, that's correct. I prefer to stay close to the left side to avoid any confusion.

Speaker 1:
You feel safer driving close to the left because of the barrier?

Speaker 2:
Yes, the barrier and the median strip make it feel safer. Also, it leaves more space for other cars on the right, especially in narrow city lanes. If a large vehicle like a bus comes from behind, I prefer to stay on the left to give them more room.

Speaker 1:
What if you're in the middle lane?

Speaker 2:
In the middle lane, I make sure not to drive on the lane lines. I stay within my lane because driving on the lines can affect cars in adjacent lanes and make them uncomfortable.

Speaker 1:
Why do you avoid driving on the lane lines?

Speaker 2:
Driving on the lane lines can confuse other drivers about your intentions and make them uncomfortable. It can also affect their driving.

Speaker 1:
So, you always drive at the speed limit?

Speaker 2:
Yes, as long as there are no cars in front of me.
**Speaker 1:**
So, you tend to drive at the speed limit regardless of the road conditions?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, as long as there are no other cars, I drive at the speed limit. If the limit is 60, I drive at 60. If it's 85, I drive at 85.

**Speaker 1:**
What kind of following distance do you usually maintain at different speeds?

**Speaker 2:**
I try to keep a distance of one to two car lengths when I'm not actively adjusting my speed.

**Speaker 1:**
At what speed do you maintain this distance?

**Speaker 2:**
If the speed limit is 40 km/h, I keep about a 10-meter distance, which is roughly two car lengths.

**Speaker 1:**
And at 60 km/h?

**Speaker 2:**
At 60 km/h, if there aren't many cars, I extend the distance to about 20 meters to allow enough reaction and braking time. I don't tailgate because it's too stressful and dangerous. If the car in front suddenly brakes, I need enough time to react.

**Speaker 1:**
What about at 80 km/h or even 100 km/h, like on Beijing's ring roads?

**Speaker 2:**
At those speeds, I maintain an even longer distance, at least 50 meters, because everyone is driving fast. I haven't calculated it exactly, but it feels about right.

**Speaker 1:**
On highways, the recommended distances are 50, 100, or 150 meters.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, on highways, if I'm driving over 100 km/h, I keep at least 100 to 200 meters distance. It's crucial for safety.

**Speaker 1:**
Now, we're approaching a U-turn. Can you tell me about your usual habits when making a U-turn?

**Speaker 2:**
In heavy traffic, I follow the flow of cars closely. If there's a risk of someone cutting in, I keep a tighter distance, but still leave about half a car length to prevent accidents.
Speaker 1:
So, you maintain half a car length distance from the car in front to prevent others from cutting in?

Speaker 2:
Yes, because everyone is in line and doesn't like others cutting in. So, I keep a close distance. If it's a solid line, I don't mind if someone tries to cut in because they'll get fined if caught. But if it's a dashed line, I'll follow more closely to prevent others from cutting in.

Speaker 1:
I see. So, if it's a solid line like here, you don't worry about others cutting in and keep a longer distance. But if it's a dashed line, you follow more closely, right? How close do you get?

Speaker 2:
At most, two meters. We keep a distance that we feel we can react to in time.

Speaker 1:
So, today, the solid line distance might be a bit longer, around three to four meters?

Speaker 2:
Honestly, I'm driving more cautiously today because of this interview. Normally, I'm more relaxed, but today I'm a bit nervous.

Speaker 1:
But you're not too nervous today, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, but I still need to be more careful.

Speaker 1:
When you reverse or make a U-turn, do you pay extra attention?

Speaker 2:
Yes, for a U-turn, I first check if I can legally make the turn. If I can make it in one go, that's great. If not, I try to move to the right a bit and make a wider turn. If I know I can't make it even after moving right, I just adjust based on the space available.

Speaker 1:
So, your judgment today was that you couldn't make the turn?

Speaker 2:
Yes, because there were cars in front, and I could see it wasn't possible.

Speaker 1:
So, you didn't try to move to the right?

Speaker 2:
I didn't deliberately move to the right. On my second attempt, I did move a bit to the right, but it still didn't work. It was just not possible.

Speaker 1:
I understand. Normally, you would try to move to the right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I would try to make the turn in one go because reversing is dangerous and time-consuming.

Speaker 1:
I noticed you did try to move to the right.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I tried to move as much as possible because moving too far to the left makes it difficult. Ideally, I should have moved forward to the dashed line area to make the turn, but crossing the solid line is not allowed.
Speaker 1:
You can only make a U-turn at this spot because it's a dashed line. Crossing the line here is not allowed.

Speaker 2:
I noticed you left a pretty wide gap when making the U-turn. Actually, you might have been able to make it in one go today.

Speaker 1:
If I couldn't make it, I couldn't make it. The length of the car makes it difficult in this space. I didn't want to take the risk of hitting the curb. It's too close.

Speaker 2:
This section doesn't have any cars. Did you complete any lane changes or overtaking during the test? 

Speaker 1:
No, the official test didn't include lane changes or overtaking.

Speaker 2:
No, because there wasn't much traffic on this road.

Speaker 1:
I couldn't see your actual overtaking maneuvers. So, can you tell me about your usual driving habits for lane changes and overtaking?

Speaker 2:
Under normal circumstances, when I overtake, I first check my left side and behind to see if there are any cars.

Speaker 1:
You check the left rear side.

Speaker 2:
Yes, if there are no cars, I proceed smoothly and accelerate. If I need to return to my original lane, I first check the distance to the car in front of me and the speed and distance of the car on my right.

Speaker 1:
For example, if there's a car in front of you in your lane and you need to overtake it, you check the distance to the car on your left and the speed of the cars on both sides.

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly.

Speaker 1:
Do you check anything else when overtaking?

Speaker 2:
Not really. As long as there are no cars behind me or if the car behind is at a safe distance and speed, I can overtake. If I can overtake, I make a decisive move.

Speaker 1:
I have a small question. When you switch to the left lane, do you check the car on your right and the road ahead?

Speaker 2:
Yes, because I need to merge back.

Speaker 1:
Right, you need to merge back. So, if the distance between the car you're overtaking and the car in front of it is not enough, what do you do?

Speaker 2:
Then I don't merge back. I stay in the left lane until it's safe to merge back.

Speaker 1:
Understood. Now, when you make a right turn, how do you assess the situation on the side road?

Speaker 2:
When making a right turn, I check the surroundings carefully.

Speaker 1:
You also check the bushes and other obstacles.

Speaker 2:
Yes, so I slow down and look to the right to ensure it's safe before proceeding.
Speaker 2:
Yes, so when driving in this area, the speed is relatively slow. When you reach this point, you need to turn your head to the right to check if there are any cars. If there are no pedestrians, you can proceed. As you approach the main road, you should also check the left side for any oncoming vehicles or pedestrians.

Speaker 1:
I understand.

Speaker 1:
At this point, he wants to park, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, but it seems like he is just stopping.

Speaker 1:
It feels like you are driving over the dashed line on the right side.

Speaker 2:
That's because the car coming from the opposite direction is driving over the line.

Speaker 1:
So, naturally, I have to move to the right.

Speaker 2:
Exactly.

Speaker 1:
When did you realize that the other car was over the line?

Speaker 2:
When I reached this point. You can see it better if you rewind a bit.

Speaker 1:
It seems like you anticipated it early and started moving to the right.

Speaker 2:
Yes, because at this point, the two lanes merge into one. The car ahead was trying to overtake a right-turning vehicle, so it was coming towards me.

Speaker 1:
So, from that distance, you decided to stick to the right side.

Speaker 2:
Yes, there was no need to stay on the left and face the oncoming car.

Speaker 1:
How far were you from the intersection at that point?

Speaker 2:
Not very far. It looks far from this angle, but when you're in the car, it's not that far.

Speaker 1:
Was it about 100 meters?

Speaker 2:
No, more like 50 meters. In a car, 50 meters is not a long distance. You can cover it quickly.

Speaker 1:
So, you returned to the center of the lane, right? And then there was a right turn ahead.

Speaker 2:
Yes, and there was a red light. Since you are participating in an experiment, to ensure safety during the experiment, were there any specific areas you paid extra attention to while driving?

Speaker 2:
During the experiment?

Speaker 1:
Yes.

Speaker 2:
Throughout the experiment, I paid attention to road signs, markings, and traffic lights.

Speaker 1:
Were there any specific signs or markings you were particularly cautious about?

Speaker 2:
Actually, the most important thing was watching out for pedestrians and electric bikes, especially when turning. They are more unpredictable than traffic lights, which are straightforward. Pedestrians and electric bikes can be more dangerous, as we saw earlier.
Speaker 1:
Because traffic lights are clear and visible, I can see them. But as we just drove through this section, we noticed that pedestrians and electric bikes, especially electric bikes, pose the greatest danger.

Speaker 2:
There are no electric bikes here, so you should just go through. What other areas do you focus on besides traffic lights, signs, and pedestrians?

Speaker 1:
Well, today’s route passes through residential areas, workplaces, and schools. So, whenever I pass by these places, I make sure to check in advance if there are any people or cars coming out.

Speaker 2:
Do you slow down?

Speaker 1:
I don't slow down, but I do ease off the accelerator.

Speaker 2:
So, you just release the gas pedal.

Speaker 1:
Yes, I stop accelerating and lift my foot off the gas pedal.

Speaker 2:
When driving, do you recognize whether the road is within a residential area or a workplace? For example, do you identify if there are residential buildings or office entrances on both sides?

Speaker 1:
If I'm driving in the city, I always watch both sides. If there are crosswalks or gaps in the sidewalk, it usually means there are entrances or exits. If you are familiar with the area, it’s not a big deal because you know where everything is. But if you are not familiar, you might not see a gap because of trees or other obstructions. However, if there is a gap or a crosswalk, it indicates there are doors on both sides.

Speaker 2:
Got it. So, do you want to switch to the left lane or take a detour?

Speaker 1:
Yes, I want to take a detour. I always check early to see if there are any pedestrians, non-motorized vehicles, or other cars that might enter my lane. If I see a pedestrian, I take action to avoid them well in advance.

Speaker 2:
Is that so?

Speaker 1:
Yes, it should be at least 50 meters away.

Speaker 2:
On this type of road, if there are no other people or vehicles, you have the space to avoid them. But if there are many people or oncoming vehicles, what do you do?

Speaker 1:
In such cases, I don’t need to slow down; I just gently steer to avoid them. I can also lightly honk the horn to alert the pedestrian.

Speaker 2:
So, you lightly press the horn twice to remind the pedestrian.

Speaker 1:
Yes, and if the pedestrian moves to the left, I adjust accordingly.

Speaker 2:
Exactly, and non-motorized vehicles usually move to the left as well.
Speaker 1: So, you were reminding the pedestrian.

Speaker 2: Yes, and the pedestrian was moving to the left.

Speaker 1: Did you signal? As long as there is this kind of situation...

Speaker 2: Yes, non-motorized vehicles tend to move to the left, but we just ease off the accelerator.

Speaker 1: Right, I might not brake, but I would ease off the accelerator because there's no need to brake if you can avoid it, right?

Speaker 2: At this point, I was staying close to the left side.

Speaker 1: Because there were electric bikes and bicycles on that side.

Speaker 2: Yes, because there were bicycles, so I stayed close to the left.

Speaker 1: And you kept to the left to maintain a safe distance.

Speaker 2: Yes, you see, there was also a vehicle going the wrong way ahead.

Speaker 1: Yes, I see. Even though you knew you were far from it, you still moved to the left to give yourself more reaction time.

Speaker 2: Yes, to give myself more reaction time for safety.

Speaker 1: During this drive, were you paying attention to any other safety aspects?

Speaker 2: Not particularly.

Speaker 1: You didn't feel the need to focus on anything else?

Speaker 2: No, I felt it was a pretty normal drive.

Speaker 1: How do you think driving can be made safer? Or do you think there's room for improvement based on this drive?

Speaker 2: Given the road conditions, there wasn't much complexity.

Speaker 1: The road conditions weren't too complicated.

Speaker 2: Yes, I think to ensure safety, you need to handle road situations with foresight.

Speaker 1: Foresight?

Speaker 2: For example, if I'm 200 meters from a traffic light, I can see the light and the countdown. If I see the light just turned red or has been red for a while, I can decide whether to stop or go. Nowadays, with automatic transmissions, it's easier. In the past, with manual transmissions, if you saw a red light 200-300 meters away, you'd shift to neutral and coast. You wouldn't need to brake; you'd just glide forward. When the light turned green, you'd shift back into gear and go. This foresight prevents abrupt stops, which are uncomfortable for passengers and bad for the car. Especially when driving for executives, smooth driving is essential. With automatic transmissions, you can just ease off the accelerator and glide forward. There's no point in accelerating towards a red light.

Speaker 1: Yes, handling road situations with foresight.

Speaker 2: Exactly, and not just for traffic lights.
Speaker 1:
When you see an oil light, no matter how much you press the accelerator, you won't get through. Yes, it's about anticipating and handling the road conditions.

Speaker 2:
Yes, besides traffic lights, what other situations do you handle on the road?

Speaker 1:
For example, if I see a pedestrian ahead.

Speaker 2:
Or if there's a wrong-way light, or a turn signal. When you see these from a distance, you should lift your foot off the accelerator and start braking in advance. This kind of proactive approach ensures safety.

Speaker 1:
Can you recall a driving experience? What situations do you find particularly frightening?

Speaker 2:
I'm particularly afraid of electric bikes running red lights. For instance, when I'm making a right turn at an intersection, the light might be green for me, but pedestrians are crossing, so I have to yield. By the time the pedestrians have crossed, the light turns red again, and then it turns green for the other direction, bringing more pedestrians. It's really hard to make a right turn in such situations.

Speaker 1:
I understand, but even when the light is green...

Speaker 2:
I still can't turn.

Speaker 1:
So, in this scenario, the lane next to you and the crosswalk make it difficult, right? If you try to turn right on a red light...

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. You have to inch forward slowly and yield when necessary. But the real danger comes from those going the wrong way or running red lights. Even when I have a green light and I'm going straight, I still slow down and check for anyone running the red light or going the wrong way because sometimes you just can't see them.

Speaker 1:
Besides non-motorized vehicles and pedestrians running red lights, what other situations concern you?

Speaker 2:
Other than that, nothing really scares me. The unpredictable nature of these situations is what's frightening. Sometimes you just can't see them coming.

Speaker 1:
And you don't have control over these situations.

Speaker 2:
Exactly. No matter how much space you leave, if someone cuts in front of you, you might not see them in time. That's what's really scary.

Speaker 1:
Got it. Now, let's move on. We're approaching a left turn. This should be the first left turn of the experiment. Can you describe your approach to making a left turn here?

Speaker 2:
Before this point, there was another left turn...
Speaker 1: Could you describe your experience with the first left turn in the experiment? This was the first left turn, right?

Speaker 2: Actually, there was a left turn before this one.

Speaker 1: No, this is the first left turn.

Speaker 2: Oh, you mean the right turn before this?

Speaker 1: Yes, the right turn before this. Exactly.

Speaker 2: Yes, we made a figure-eight turn here.

Speaker 1: Right, could you describe your experience with the left turn? Previously, we only discussed the right turn.

Speaker 2: Sure, for the left turn, as I approached the intersection, there were two cars going straight. I had to stop and yield to them. While yielding, I checked to see if there were any cars coming from the right. Since I had already slowed down or stopped, I looked to the right to ensure no cars were coming. Once those two cars passed and there were no more cars behind them or coming from the right, I proceeded. The visibility was very good. I noticed a tricycle on the right side.

Speaker 1: Where was the tricycle?

Speaker 2: It was behind the car. Yes, I saw it clearly.

Speaker 1: So, did you plan to yield to the tricycle as well?

Speaker 2: No, because it was moving slowly and I was moving faster.

Speaker 1: The tricycle was still quite far away.

Speaker 2: Yes, and when I made the turn, it hadn't even reached the intersection yet.

Speaker 1: So, there was nothing particularly frightening about the situation?

Speaker 2: No, nothing particularly frightening.

Speaker 1: Do you think you have any bad driving habits?

Speaker 2: If I'm in a good mood, no. But if I'm in a bad mood, I tend to press the accelerator a bit harder.

Speaker 1: You press the accelerator harder when you're in a bad mood?

Speaker 2: Yes, especially when I'm driving alone. I learned to drive in the military and drove military vehicles for many years. Back then, military vehicles had a certain privilege on the road. We didn't exactly follow traffic rules strictly; we drove as we pleased.

Speaker 1: Because traffic regulations weren't as strict back then?

Speaker 2: Not exactly. It's just that there weren't as many surveillance cameras, and the police weren't as strict, especially with military vehicles. We didn't drive recklessly, but we had more freedom. Nowadays, it's different. Military vehicles have to follow the rules just like everyone else.
Interviewer: How do you usually drive? 

Interviewee: I used to drive very aggressively, always overtaking any car in front of me. Back then, as a soldier, I was always in a hurry. But now, things have changed, and military drivers are more disciplined and cautious.

Interviewer: When you're a passenger, what driving behaviors make you feel nervous or uneasy?

Interviewee: Oh, there are many, haha.

Interviewer: It's because you're not in control of the steering wheel.

Interviewee: Exactly. When I'm driving, I feel confident about overtaking or changing lanes. But when someone else is driving, even if they think the same way, the experience is different. Your view and control over the gas pedal are not the same.

Interviewer: And your perception of speed is different too.

Interviewee: Right. The driver might think it's safe to go, but as a passenger, you might feel anxious and wish they would slow down. That's why passengers often say, "Slow down, slow down," because they aren't the ones driving.

Interviewer: What specific behaviors make you feel tense and unsafe?

Interviewee: Speeding. For example, when I'm in the car with my partner, driving in the city, there are electric bikes and other vehicles around. My partner doesn't have as much driving experience as I do, so their reactions aren't as quick. Men tend to be more daring but also careful.

Interviewer: By "reactions aren't as quick," do you mean they don't anticipate as well?

Interviewee: Yes, they lack foresight. For instance, some people will speed up even when they see a red light, only to brake hard at the last moment. They don't handle situations in advance.

Interviewer: They don't anticipate.

Interviewee: Exactly. They don't slow down gradually when they see a red light. Instead, they rush and then brake suddenly. Also, driving for a leader and driving for oneself are completely different experiences.

Interviewer: How so?

Interviewee: It depends on the person. If someone is meticulous and disciplined in their daily life, it shows in their driving. They observe and react carefully. But if someone is careless and hasty, their driving reflects that too. You can probably relate to this.

Interviewer: Specifically, what driving behaviors make you feel unsafe? You mentioned overtaking and sudden acceleration.

Interviewee: Yes, sudden acceleration and sharp turns.
**Interviewer:** What specific behaviors make you feel unsafe while driving? You mentioned overtaking earlier, right? And also sudden acceleration.

**Interviewee:** Yes, sudden acceleration and sharp steering.

**Interviewer:** Sharp steering?

**Interviewee:** Yes, very quick steering. Whether it's changing lanes or turning, we usually do it gradually. But some drivers just make abrupt moves.

**Interviewer:** They just make a sudden turn, right? And then quickly correct the direction.

**Interviewee:** Yes, they make sudden moves, which makes you feel uneasy as a passenger.

**Interviewer:** Anything else?

**Interviewee:** It's really about driving habits. For example, we had a driver in our team who used to drive a bus. Many people complained about him, saying he should be replaced. When I asked why, they said he made them feel sick because of his driving style. We had a project in the mountains, and the roads were winding. You need to drive smoothly in such conditions.

**Interviewer:** Especially on mountain roads, sharp steering can be dangerous.

**Interviewee:** Yes, when you turn sharply on mountain roads, the car sways from side to side. You can't see the oncoming traffic, and if you drive too fast, passengers feel very unsafe. Also, he would brake suddenly, not just at red lights but in any situation.

**Interviewer:** Okay, let's get back to our video. This intersection is a crucial part of our test route. It doesn't have traffic lights, so you might need to recall what happened there.

**Interviewee:** This intersection is on a major north-south road with a lot of traffic and pedestrians. The other roads have less traffic.

**Interviewer:** So you need to be extra careful?

**Interviewee:** Yes, especially since my vision is limited by the mirror and the hat I was wearing. I couldn't turn my head much, so I had to rely on my peripheral vision to check for safety. There were many people and cars at this intersection, so I had to be very cautious when turning.

**Interviewer:** We were making a right turn at that time, right?

**Interviewee:** Yes, a right turn.

**Interviewer:** How did you handle the right turn?

**Interviewee:** When making a right turn, I first checked for any oncoming traffic.
Speaker 1: So, you couldn't turn right at that moment?

Speaker 2: When I was turning right, I first checked if there were any oncoming vehicles from the opposite direction because they would be coming into my lane. I had to be cautious about that, even though it wasn't exactly a blind spot.

Speaker 1: You mean oncoming traffic from the opposite direction?

Speaker 2: Yes, exactly. I checked for any oncoming vehicles. Then I looked to the left to see if there were any pedestrians or cars.

Speaker 1: And the pedestrians and cars were quite far from you, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, they were far enough. So, I proceeded to turn right smoothly.

Speaker 1: At that point, you had already prepared to turn right?

Speaker 2: Yes, because I was approaching the right turn.

Speaker 1: Got it.

Speaker 1: Then there was another right turn, which was the actual turn onto the main road. This should have been done at a controlled speed.

Speaker 2: At that point, I intended to yield to a pedestrian, but...

Speaker 1: Which pedestrian? The two over there?

Speaker 2: No, the middle-aged woman who was not walking towards us. 

Speaker 1: Ah, we were too far away. We should have...

Speaker 2: No, I remember. 

Speaker 1: You remember? Even from that distance?

Speaker 2: Yes, not that far, but on that road, in that city.

Speaker 1: So, when you were approaching, you saw her and intended to yield?

Speaker 2: Yes, I wanted to yield to her.

Speaker 1: But she...

Speaker 2: She was walking slowly. I understood that she was still some distance away, so I proceeded. Actually, she was already close to my car.

Speaker 1: I see. Now, I want to ask about your usual driving habits. You mentioned that you often drive important passengers, so I believe you pay attention to their experience. What aspects do you focus on to ensure a comfortable ride for your passengers?

Speaker 2: The most crucial aspect is the comfort of the ride.

Speaker 1: How do you improve the comfort of the ride?

Speaker 2: From the start, it's about smooth acceleration and braking. When starting, you need to be steady. During the drive, it's about maintaining a balance between speed and stability. For us, it's about being fast yet stable. It's not about driving slowly, but how to ensure both speed and stability.

Speaker 1: How do you ensure both speed and stability?

Speaker 2: If you're driving at 60 or 80 km/h and need to slow down, you should decelerate gradually. You shouldn't let the passengers feel the deceleration or the lane changes or turns. Of course, it's impossible for them to feel nothing, but ideally, if a passenger is dozing off, they shouldn't even realize when the car stops. They should just wake up and find that they've arrived.
If the passenger is resting with their eyes closed, they might not even notice when the car stops. 

Speaker 2:
So, if the passenger isn't asleep, how do I gradually bring the car to a stop? Even when waiting at a red light, I need to stop slowly. When stopping, you might be paying attention to other cars. If you see another car stop abruptly, causing a jolt, my car would barely feel it. 

Speaker 1:
So, there's no back-and-forth jolting.

Speaker 2:
No, you barely feel it, especially with this Mercedes 450 I'm driving now. It has air suspension, which is softer than the mechanical hydraulic suspension in regular cars. Hydraulic suspension is stiffer, so even a slight hard press on the brake won't feel as soft. But with air suspension, it's different.

Speaker 1:
It's softer, so it can cause more swaying.

Speaker 2:
Yes, with air suspension, it sways more. If you brake hard, it sways noticeably. When you go over a speed bump, hydraulic suspension goes "thump-thump" and it's over. But with air suspension, it sways gently over the bump. You need to ensure passengers don't feel the bump too much.

Speaker 1:
So, what should you do to make sure passengers don't feel the speed bump?

Speaker 2:
You need to slow down as much as possible.

Speaker 1:
Slow down, right.

Speaker 2:
You should feel the front wheels touch the speed bump and then slowly go over it, rather than just bumping over it quickly. It's all about comfort, especially when driving important passengers.

Speaker 1:
I noticed you moved the steering wheel to the left and crossed the dashed line. Why was that?

Speaker 2:
Because the right turn is still far ahead, and a large vehicle was coming out. So, I moved to the middle lane. 

Speaker 1:
I see, so you moved to the middle lane because of the distance and the large vehicle.

Speaker 2:
Yes, my speed was faster, and the other vehicle was slower, so I moved to the middle lane.

Speaker 1:
And then you moved back. 

Speaker 2:
Yes, I moved back because the next turn is a right turn. 

Speaker 1:
Do you think you have any bad driving habits that might make passengers uncomfortable?

Speaker 2:
Honestly, I don't think so. Over the years, I haven't noticed any.

Speaker 1:
When you ride in someone else's car, what driving habits make you uncomfortable?

Speaker 2:
It's the opposite of what I mentioned earlier. Sudden acceleration when starting and hard braking when stopping make me uncomfortable.
**Speaker 2:**
The discomfort I mentioned earlier comes from abrupt acceleration when starting and sudden braking when stopping. It's not exactly slamming the brakes, but it's not smooth either. Since I'm used to driving for my boss, I naturally expect the same smoothness when I'm a passenger. If others don't drive that way, it feels uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
I understand. We've also collected data from passenger handles, which they press when they feel uncomfortable. Would you be interested in seeing where passengers press the handle?

**Speaker 2:**
Sure, I can take a look. As I mentioned, I might not notice it when I'm driving, but it's important to consider others' feelings.

**Speaker 1:**
Exactly. After we watch the entire video, I'll show you the data.

**Speaker 2:**
Alright.

**Speaker 1:**
You mentioned earlier that you pay attention to certain things while driving. Today, since you had passengers in your car, were you more attentive to their comfort?

**Speaker 2:**
Honestly, I was a bit cautious and nervous because this is an experimental study, not because of the passengers. If I were driving my boss or important clients, I would be more attentive. Today, my focus was mainly on the experiment itself.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it. In your opinion, what makes driving more comfortable for passengers, aside from what you mentioned earlier?

**Speaker 2:**
I think I've covered most of it. It's about smooth driving.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright. The next question might be a bit challenging and requires some thought. What do you think makes a good or professional driver? What qualities should they have?

**Speaker 2:**
Having driven for many years and managed drivers, I believe a professional driver should first be familiar with their vehicle. They should know the car's performance well, almost inside out. For example, they should check if the car has enough fuel and perform all necessary checks before driving.
Speaker 2:
Before you start driving, you need to check if your car has fuel and perform all necessary inspections.

Speaker 1:
Besides these checks, I mean in terms of driving skills.

Speaker 2:
Once you are familiar with the car's performance, you will know how to drive it more comfortably, making the ride more pleasant for passengers. Essentially, it comes down to the driver's character and how they approach their responsibilities. A good driver naturally knows how to be competent.

Speaker 1:
What makes a competent driver? Since you have managed drivers before, what are your evaluation criteria?

Speaker 2:
From a management perspective, the first thing is to ensure that the car is well-maintained.

Speaker 1:
I mean, mainly in terms of driving.

Speaker 2:
In terms of driving, the first rule is to follow traffic regulations. You can't be violating rules every day. Additionally, when driving, you need to ensure the ride is comfortable for passengers, especially for important passengers like leaders. This means no sudden movements and smooth driving.

Speaker 1:
I want to discuss in more detail what you mean by comfort.

Speaker 2:
Comfort, especially for passengers, means a smooth ride. This includes smooth acceleration and braking, and making sure there are no sudden jerks. The goal is to avoid any discomfort for the passengers. This is the most direct way to ensure a comfortable ride.

Speaker 1:
What do you think is the biggest difference between experienced and new drivers?

Speaker 2:
Experience. Experienced drivers can anticipate and handle various situations on the road better.

Speaker 1:
Can you be more specific?

Speaker 2:
For example, I can foresee potential issues on the road and react in advance, whereas a new driver might not know how to anticipate or maintain a safe distance. They might not know what to expect.

Speaker 1:
They might not know what could happen.

Speaker 2:
Exactly.
Speaker 1:
He doesn't know how to calculate the timing, and he doesn't know how far in advance to maintain a safe distance.

Speaker 2:
Right, and we might need to adapt to any car we drive. We need to understand the car's condition, how much pressure to apply on the brake to stop smoothly and comfortably. But a novice driver can't feel that. They don't know how much force to use to make the braking comfortable.

Speaker 1:
Got it. Let's look at this video again. Earlier, there was a small electric vehicle, so you moved to the left lane, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. I moved to the left lane in advance.

Speaker 1:
I noticed you stayed in the left lane for quite a while before moving back. Why was that?

Speaker 2:
First, I was overtaking the small tricycle. Second, there was an intersection ahead. Also, there was a car in front. You can see it if you look ahead. Not this car, but another small car. Yes, this one. And there was a minibus too. So, it wasn't feasible to return to the original lane immediately.

Speaker 1:
When you borrow the left lane and drive against traffic, do you feel nervous or slightly unsafe?

Speaker 2:
No, because first, I check if there are any oncoming cars. Second, I observe if there are people in the cars and if they might open their doors.

Speaker 1:
Understood. Now, back to this intersection. Do you find left turns or right turns more difficult?

Speaker 2:
Left turns are definitely more difficult. And there are clearly more cars now compared to earlier.

Speaker 1:
Yes, there are more cars.

Speaker 2:
I had to drive close to the oncoming lane to avoid the right side because I couldn't see the cars coming from the right when turning. But I could see the left side.

Speaker 1:
You moved more to the left to avoid the right side, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, when I make a left turn, I usually...

Speaker 1:
You almost drive over the line, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, because I can't see the right side.

Speaker 1:
Is it because of your glasses?

Speaker 2:
Partly, and also because I'm not familiar with this car. It's not my own car, so I can't see if there are cars coming from the right. So, I try to avoid them as much as possible. Even if there are cars on this side, they can still pass, and I can avoid them.

Speaker 1:
Is that horn sound from your car?

Speaker 2:
No, our horn isn't that loud. Let me reply to this message.

Speaker 1:
Alright.

Speaker 2:
That's it.
**Speaker 1:**
Hey, is this the horn? I mean, isn't it?

**Speaker 2:**
Our horn isn't this loud. Let me reply to this message. Okay.

**Speaker 1:**
Just like that.

**Speaker 2:**
Wow, it's already been an hour.

**Speaker 1:**
We only have a few questions left. After watching this video, you can just take a look at the handle. Alright. So, I want to ask you, this might be a bit difficult, but in what aspects do you think autonomous cars can never match human drivers?

**Speaker 2:**
Well, I don't know about the speed of autonomous driving. For example, when we drive, we can adjust the throttle based on the situation ahead. I can lift my foot off the gas pedal, and the car will still move forward. Can autonomous driving do that?

**Speaker 1:**
Exactly.

**Speaker 2:**
It always maintains a constant speed.

**Speaker 1:**
So, can it move without pressing the gas pedal? Yes, it can.

**Speaker 2:**
It should be able to.

**Speaker 1:**
It only relies on road friction to decelerate, which is entirely possible. Right.

**Speaker 2:**
I don't know much about autonomous driving. I've only seen those cars running around in Yizhuang.

**Speaker 1:**
So, do you think there are aspects of your driving that autonomous cars can never match? Because I think you're a very professional driver. At least for now, autonomous cars can't reach your level. Are you worried about being replaced by autonomous cars in the future?

**Speaker 2:**
Cars? That's normal, definitely. 

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think there are certain driving characteristics that autonomous cars can't replicate?

**Speaker 2:**
If it's just about driving, they will definitely replace us. But when it comes to things beyond driving, they can't do it.

**Speaker 1:**
Beyond driving?

**Speaker 2:**
I mean various services. If it's just about operating the car, autonomous driving can definitely do it. It can handle road conditions for sure. 

**Speaker 1:**
Let's look at this right turn. What was the situation when you observed it? Because I can't see it clearly from here.

**Speaker 2:**
For this right turn, first, I had already reached this point. I checked that there were no pedestrians on the left. This is a side road. On the main road, I saw a taxi, but it was far behind me. So, I turned slowly, let the taxi pass, and then accelerated. I moved to the left and let them go.

**Speaker 1:**
Here, still...

**Speaker 2:**
Continue to the left, yes, keep going left.
Speaker 1:
In that situation, I accelerated and moved to the left, and I managed to avoid them.

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. I kept moving to the left because I needed to make a U-turn. I continued to steer left.

Speaker 1:
Got it. Oh, I have two more questions. One is, how do you judge the intentions of pedestrians, non-motorized vehicles, and motor vehicles while driving? Let's start with pedestrians since you mentioned earlier that it's important to be predictive. How do you make these predictive judgments? Let's start with how you predict the intentions of pedestrians, then non-motorized vehicles, and finally motor vehicles.

Speaker 2:
Starting with pedestrians, no matter which intersection I approach, I need to determine if the pedestrian intends to cross the road or just walk alongside my car. First, I would tap the brake to see their reaction. If they intend to cross, I will yield to them. If they don't respond or move, and I have enough space and time, I will proceed.

Speaker 1:
So, you would accelerate and pass them?

Speaker 2:
Not exactly accelerate, but I would proceed normally. However, if it's a situation involving a crosswalk, I would yield to pedestrians. If they don't move, I might honk or gesture for them to go. If they still don't move, then...

Speaker 1:
Right, if you encounter a crosswalk, you should yield to pedestrians. If you stop or slow down and they don't move, you can gesture for them to go. What else were you going to say?

Speaker 2:
If it's not a crosswalk, it's usually clear whether a pedestrian intends to cross or not. On the road, their intentions are generally obvious. If they want to cross, they will; if not, they won't. It's straightforward. But yielding is essential for me.

Speaker 1:
No matter what, you should always...

Speaker 2:
I will always yield. I will tap the brake to give them a chance. If they proceed, then fine. For non-motorized vehicles, it's similar. If I'm turning and there's a non-motorized vehicle approaching, I will consider its speed, my speed, and the surrounding traffic to decide whether to yield or go first.

Speaker 1:
So, you pay close attention to the speed of non-motorized vehicles.

Speaker 2:
Yes, because...

Speaker 1:
If they are fast, you assume they won't yield; if they are slow, you assume they will.

Speaker 2:
If they are slow and far away, I have enough time and space to proceed.
Speaker 1:
When a vehicle is moving fast, you feel it won't slow down, right?

Speaker 2:
If it's moving slowly and is far from me, I have enough time and space to pass, so I will go.

Speaker 1:
But if it's moving too fast, you...

Speaker 2:
If it's moving very fast and might compete with me, I will definitely let it go. It's too dangerous otherwise.

Speaker 1:
So you won't...

Speaker 2:
I won't compete. I will definitely let it go.

Speaker 1:
Is it relatively simpler with motor vehicles?

Speaker 2:
Yes, it's somewhat simpler with motor vehicles, but it also depends on my speed, the other vehicle's speed, and the distance. I also need to see if it's turning or going straight to make a judgment.

Speaker 1:
If it's turning...

Speaker 2:
If a motor vehicle is turning, its headlights will usually be on. More than 90% of the time, they will signal. It's rare for them not to.

Speaker 1:
Okay, one last question. Imagine a scenario where there's an intersection without traffic lights, and there are pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles crossing the road. You also need to pass through this intersection. How would you handle this situation? How do you judge the intentions of the pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles?

Speaker 2:
In the absence of traffic lights, before entering the intersection, I would first check for pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles. If they are present, I would judge whether they intend to cross or not. As I mentioned earlier, I would let them go first. Once they have crossed and if conditions allow, I would proceed. That's generally how I drive.

Speaker 1:
So, if they don't cross, you would go. Right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, or if they are far from me, even if they are at the intersection, but it's a large intersection or they are at a distance, and I have enough time to pass, I would go directly.

Speaker 1:
What if there's a crosswalk, and after you stop, someone is there, and you both see each other and try to let each other go?

Speaker 2:
I would definitely stop and let them go.

Speaker 1:
So, you wouldn't speed up after seeing them let you go?

Speaker 2:
No, I would still let them go. This might be a personal preference, but I would let them go. I would wave them on.

Speaker 1:
Because sometimes people and cars both try to let each other go, and then both move forward at the same time.

Speaker 2:
That's when problems can easily occur. If you see them letting you go and you decide to go, but they also decide to go, it can lead to a collision, especially if the distance is short. So, in such situations, I would wave them on to go first. If they are determined not to go...
Speaker 1:
The speed is fine, but if you're too close, it's easy to bump into something. This happens quite often. So, in such situations, I usually wave them on. If they don't go, then I proceed because it's safer that way. Understood?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I understand. That's what I'll do. Alright.

Speaker 1:
Let's finish watching this last video. Yes, and after that, I'll show you the controls. Did you have to wait long at the green light?

Speaker 2:
No, it was already green. I didn't have to wait for the left turn signal.

Speaker 1:
So, when you switch to the side road, do you enter the left turn waiting area first? 

Speaker 2:
No, I don't. I just turn directly because I don't need to make a left turn.

Speaker 1:
The panoramic video is split into two parts, so it's hard to see everything. When does the panoramic view start?

Speaker 1:
I just saw the timestamp, 15:56:15. That's the start time of this segment. Let's check the first one.

Speaker 1:
No problem. Let me see which position Controller 1 is in. Okay, 16:15:51, right? Alright, May 16th, 15:51:32. This is the start time. So, 15:51:32, and it starts 4 minutes before that. Is that correct?

Speaker 1:
Yes, that's right. The passenger was looking at the time during the U-turn. Should we consider it during the U-turn?

Speaker 2:
Yes, because before the U-turn, we were just waiting. There was nothing to be nervous about. The tension came during the U-turn and reversing.

Speaker 1:
These are all fractions of a second, so it shouldn't be the original case. It's during the reversing. Yes, that's right. It was only during the reversing that he felt nervous.

Speaker 2:
Alright, that's the only time he pressed the button.

Speaker 1:
Yes, he pressed it at that moment.

Speaker 2:
Both handles were pressed at that moment.

Speaker 1:
Yes, exactly. Alright, there's nothing else. Our interview is over. Thank you. Here's something for you.
Speaker 1:
Alright, is there anything else you would like to add? No? Okay, our interview is now complete. Great. I have something for you here.

Speaker 2:
Yes, you can check it on your phone in advance if needed. If not, that's fine.

Speaker 1:
I just need you to sign here.

Speaker 2:
Sure, I can do that.

Speaker 1:
No, no, it's one, two, three, four, five, six. Yes, exactly. Because our finance department at Tsinghua will handle it directly for you.

Speaker 2:
Oh, writing this is quite a hassle. Can I...
