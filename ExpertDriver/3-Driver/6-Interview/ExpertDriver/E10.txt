**Transcript:**

**Speaker 1:**
So, I need to share my screen, right? Yes, share your screen and then start recording.

**Speaker 2:**
This thing.

**Speaker 1:**
What is it stuck on?

**Speaker 1:**
Why did my computer also get involved? Are you switching machines?

**Speaker 1:**
T19A01, for 2. Hmm, it didn't drop, it's over 60%.

**Speaker 1:**
Hello, can you say a few words to test?

**Speaker 2:**
Hello, you can.

**Speaker 1:**
P19.

**Speaker 1:**
Why? Don't scare me. Are you holding B? Can you check if B is there?

**Speaker 1:**
It takes some time to import because the eye-tracking video we recorded is being imported. This way, you don't have to take the test, right?

**Speaker 2:**
From ChatGPT, you mind you tomorrow.

**Speaker 1:**
I know because I only have one computer, so I can turn on both the speaker and the microphone. Let's listen carefully to see if we can hear the sound from the eye-tracking.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, this red dot is the point of view. Right.

**Speaker 1:**
The red dot is where your eyes were looking at the time. Hmm, no, UG.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, can you look at it? Then, does the video I'm sharing have sound? Hmm, you can check a bit. Please ensure both the driver and passengers fasten their seat belts and adjust the seatbacks to a comfortable position. Drivers, please avoid resting your head on the seatback as much as possible so we can better monitor the brainwave device. Did I miss any steps? I feel like I might have caused the meeting room upstairs to be locked down. Then, look, hmm, go to the 12th floor, press a button quickly, lift it up, and press it down firmly. Can you hear the sound of it being pressed? This helps us record and synchronize your voice.

**Speaker 2:**
Please do not make any adjustments or operations on the device during recording to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data collection. Is that clear? Everyone can now place their hands on the red button on the wristband, and you will soon hear the sound of the collection starting.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, let's prepare for the final interview session. Hmm, I'll adjust this to the point when we start. Hmm, yes, then move it a bit further back. Okay, let me introduce myself. My name is Chang Xiang, and I am the researcher responsible for your final interview stage.

**Speaker 1:**
Hmm, during many interview stages, we will review the video recorded during the experiment. Hmm, we will explore your driving habits together. Hmm, at any point you find interesting, or if I find something interesting, we can discuss it anytime.
Speaker 1:
Alright, let's start with some simple questions. Over the years, as a professional driver, what types of vehicles have you driven? For example, gasoline cars, electric cars, off-road vehicles, SUVs, sedans, etc. What kinds have you driven?

Speaker 2:
In terms of vehicle types? Basically, I've driven everything except for commercial buses. I've driven business-class vehicles, off-road vehicles, commonly known as SUVs, and MPVs, which are also business-type 7-seaters.

Speaker 1:
Electric cars too?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I own an electric car.

Speaker 1:
Did you buy it recently?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I bought it last year from a BAIC dealership in South China. Before that, I also owned gasoline cars, including sedans, SUVs, and even a pickup truck.

Speaker 1:
Have you ever driven a car with assisted driving features?

Speaker 2:
I know what you mean. Since around 2017, cars have been equipped with features that can be classified as Level 1 to Level 2 autonomous driving.

Speaker 1:
So, they have some basic functions?

Speaker 2:
Yes, older cars didn't have smart features; they had something called ACC, which stands for Adaptive Cruise Control. You could set a fixed speed.

Speaker 1:
Can you adjust the following distance?

Speaker 2:
No, the older systems only allowed you to set a fixed speed.

Speaker 1:
Fixed speed?

Speaker 2:
Yes, but with the next generation of adaptive cruise control, which we call Level 1.5 to Level 2, you can adjust the following distance. The factory settings support full-speed range adaptive cruise control.
**Speaker 1:**
So, what we refer to as L1.5 to L2 level is basically ACC, which is Adaptive Cruise Control. You can adjust the following distance, and if the factory-installed software supports full-speed range, it means there's no upper speed limit. Some manufacturers might set a limit, for example, one might cap it at 150 km/h, while another might cap it at 120 km/h.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, you can set it directly. Beyond that, you have L2.0, which includes intelligent assistance. It not only has the ACC function but also manual coordination. It can correct the driving route.

**Speaker 1:**
That's the lane-keeping function, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it can intelligently intervene using big data. If your device supports it, you don't need to constantly adjust the steering; it will automatically keep you centered.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you just need to hold the steering wheel lightly, and it will correct itself. You can set a general following distance, and if you want to change lanes, it supports automatic lane changes when you signal.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you just need to signal, and it will handle the lane change if the distance is appropriate. Do you use these features in your daily life?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I use them regularly, including on city roads, ring roads, and in traffic jams.

**Speaker 1:**
That's smart. Can you share which car models you use, or do you compare several?

**Speaker 2:**
The first one I used was a Lynk & Co.

**Speaker 1:**
Lynk & Co 01, right? That's an SUV, a small one.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, an SUV. I used its app for long-distance, suburban, and city driving, including automatic parking. It could park itself and exit parking spots. I also used company cars, which are more business-oriented and have stricter functionalities.

**Speaker 1:**
Like a Mercedes?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, for example, a Rolls-Royce is very expensive, but it has these functions.

**Speaker 1:**
It should have cruise control and automatic braking.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it does.

**Speaker 1:**
But it might not have automatic parking, right? Those features are more common in new electric or hybrid smart cars.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the control is more stable in new energy vehicles. I think the intelligence in new energy vehicles, including brands like Bentley, is more advanced.
**Speaker 1:** What type of car do you drive?

**Speaker 2:** My current car is a BAIC Jihu 2.

**Speaker 1:** Jihu 2, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, that's correct. I also have an iOS sedan.

**Speaker 1:** The sedan S model?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it's a high-performance version.

**Speaker 1:** Did you buy the performance package for it?

**Speaker 2:** No, I didn't buy the performance package. I opted for the two-wheel drive version. In Beijing, it's quite popular because it comes with three laser radars and many sensing hardware components, which almost fully enable high-precision navigation.

**Speaker 1:** So, what features do you find most useful in your car?

**Speaker 2:** The automatic parking feature is quite useful. As an experienced driver, I also appreciate the remote control driving feature. For instance, if the parking spaces are too tight, I can use the remote control on my key or phone to park the car.

**Speaker 1:** So, you use the remote control to drive the car into tight spaces?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I can park the car remotely and then get in once it's parked. It's very practical. The remote parking feature is also quite handy.

**Speaker 1:** How does remote parking differ from remote driving?

**Speaker 2:** Remote driving allows you to control the car's movements in all directions, similar to using a game controller. Remote parking, on the other hand, generates an interface that shows available parking spaces, and you can select one for the car to park itself.

**Speaker 1:** So, the car automatically identifies a parking space and parks itself?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it identifies a space and parks itself. With remote driving, you have more control over the car's movements.

**Speaker 1:** Are there any other features you frequently use?

**Speaker 2:** Other than the driving-related features, I often use the intelligent driving assistance. It's quite handy for everyday use, especially for longer trips.

**Speaker 1:** Do you drive more in the city for short trips or on longer journeys?

**Speaker 2:** I mostly drive medium to long distances.
Speaker 1:
So, do you usually drive more short distances within the city or longer distances?

Speaker 2:
I actually drive both short and long distances. Recently, I’ve been driving around 200 to 300 kilometers a day.

Speaker 1:
Got it. How do you feel about driving our vehicle today? Does it feel different or uncomfortable in any way? Are there any operations that might feel unusual?

Speaker 2:
Actually, this car is quite good. There are no issues with the vehicle itself. The main thing is adjusting the seat and getting used to the car. For the first 30 to 50 meters, you need to get a feel for the brake and accelerator because it’s an automatic.

Speaker 1:
Yes, exactly.

Speaker 2:
You need to get used to the sensitivity of the brake and accelerator. The brightness of the dashboard is also something to get used to.

Speaker 1:
I understand. There are different levels of brake sensitivity and other factors to consider.

Speaker 2:
Yes, for example, during the first lap, you need to get a feel for it. Each car is different, and you need to find the right balance. The car itself is fine; it’s just about getting used to it.

Speaker 1:
I see. Have you ever been involved in any traffic accidents over the years?

Speaker 2:
No major accidents, just minor incidents. I’ve been rear-ended and had a few minor scrapes with other cars, but nothing serious.

Speaker 1:
Okay. We understand that you’ve been a professional driver for over 10 years. Can you share some of your experiences driving important clients or passengers? What do you pay attention to, and how do you ensure a good experience for them?

Speaker 2:
It depends on the situation. For example, as a full-time driver for a CEO or chairman, you need to understand their preferences regarding speed, acceleration, braking, noise levels inside the car, and cleanliness. It’s also important to manage their schedule, like reminding them 10 or 5 minutes before reaching a destination. These details are crucial because different leaders have different preferences regarding driving style and comfort.

Speaker 1:
Can you give a specific example?
**Speaker 1:**
Can you describe the preferences of different leaders and how you adapt to their requirements?

**Speaker 2:**
For example, one of my previous leaders preferred a quiet environment in the car. So, I kept all my phones on silent mode and used Bluetooth for calls and navigation without any sound. The car remained quiet unless they needed to make a call or give instructions. This was on a personal level. In terms of speed, he valued safety, likely because he was a well-known entrepreneur who cared about his personal well-being. So, in the city, we never exceeded 60 km/h, and on the ring road, we stayed below 80 km/h. On the highway, we had an understanding not to exceed a certain speed. 

Additionally, when driving on different roads, I had to consider the car I was using. For instance, if I was driving a Rolls-Royce with excellent suspension, I could drive over some bumps without much discomfort. But if I was driving a car with a stiffer suspension, like the one we tested today, I had to be more cautious.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you mean the difference between compressed suspension and mechanical suspension?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. With a stiffer suspension, I had to slow down or avoid certain bumps and potholes to ensure a smooth ride for the passenger. The goal was to make the ride as comfortable as possible.

**Speaker 1:**
So, for such passengers, it's more important that they don't feel the road. But some car designs might emphasize road feedback for the driver. These are different design philosophies.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, for example, if you switch from a sedan to a Range Rover, the experience is different. The Range Rover, being an off-road vehicle, handles bumps differently. So, it's crucial to adjust your speed and be mindful of the road conditions, whether it's a paved road, patches, or manhole covers.

**Speaker 1:**
In such situations, besides avoiding bumps, do you have other methods to ensure a smooth ride?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I can slow down or maneuver the car so that the tires don't hit the bumps directly, allowing them to pass under the car instead.

**Speaker 1:**
I see, because some bumps or manhole covers might not be in the middle of the lane but on the sides.

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly.
Speaker 2:
Yes, yes, because on some roads, there are patches or manhole covers that aren't in the middle of the lane. They might be on the side or in use.

Speaker 1:
You need to slightly adjust your position to avoid them.

Speaker 2:
You also need to consider if there are vehicles on either side.

Speaker 1:
If there are no cars, you can drive slightly in the middle of the road.

Speaker 2:
Yes, but if there are cars on both sides, you have no choice but to slow down.

Speaker 1:
Reducing speed can lessen the bumpiness.

Speaker 2:
Passengers will notice and appreciate it. If you don't consider this, they might get startled. Also, when exiting the main road or at intersections, try to drive smoothly to keep passengers comfortable. If you drive too close to one side, it might make passengers anxious. The key is to avoid fatigue, especially on long trips. I remember in 2018, I went on a road trip from Beijing, passing through Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and other places.

Speaker 1:
That sounds like an amazing journey. During such significant trips, what interesting experiences did you have, especially regarding driving techniques or passenger comfort?

Speaker 2:
When driving for executives, comfort is paramount. You need to stay highly focused and can't relax because they are your direct superiors. Over the years, I've accumulated experience and learned to make passengers feel comfortable. Initially, I didn't know what to focus on, but over time, I learned to balance comfort and safety.

Speaker 1:
How did you improve your driving skills over the years? How did you transition from not knowing what to focus on to becoming experienced and capable?

Speaker 2:
It might be related to my early experience with commercial vehicles. In the early 2000s, I provided vehicles for clients with tourism and business needs. I arranged everything for them, including transportation and accommodations.
**Speaker 1:**
So, regarding the needs of tourism and business travel, I basically provide vehicles and arrange accommodations at places like homes or mountain resorts. I offer a one-stop service that includes transportation, lodging, and meals. This way, I gradually started to understand the nuances of business reception. My background in physical management and hotel management helped me a lot in this regard. Additionally, I focus on the internal accumulation of experience, especially in areas like airport transfers. 

**Speaker 2:**
How did you accumulate your driving experience, especially in serving passengers? How did you identify the key areas to focus on and improve your value?

**Speaker 1:**
I don't compare myself to others. I once thought about the issues you mentioned. First, you need to understand that you are in a service industry. Before you start, you need to study the environment and the role of a driver. It's not just about driving skills; the most important aspect is service. This includes safety, etiquette, comfort, and hygiene. For example, when picking up passengers, you should be polite, park the car properly, make contact, and guide them into the car.

**Speaker 2:**
I'm more interested in the driving aspect itself.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, the dynamic aspect of driving. Besides the additional services, we are more concerned about making passengers feel comfortable and safe while driving.

**Speaker 2:**
As I mentioned earlier, safety and comfort are paramount. As a driver, you should minimize unnecessary communication with passengers, except for essential reminders like fastening seat belts or informing them about available amenities. The relationship changes if the passengers are friends or family, but the professional approach remains the same.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it's about maintaining professionalism.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, maintaining professionalism can be quite monotonous, but it's essential.
Speaker 1: Could you please tell us about your experience? You seem to be quite knowledgeable.

Speaker 2: Yes, I am familiar with it.

Speaker 1: You mentioned you have a professional background in this field.

Speaker 2: Yes, being a professional driver can be quite immersive, but honestly, it can also be pretty monotonous.

Speaker 1: I understand. They rarely give you feedback, right?

Speaker 2: Exactly. They don't need to because my job doesn't depend on their feedback. Let me tell you about the first time I interviewed for a job as a dedicated driver for an accident company's boss. On the first day, I had to test drive. The test drive was just a casual chat after work, and I dropped him off near his place and then left. He told me to wait until I got home.

Speaker 2: The next day, I went back, and we discussed the nature of the driving job. The expectations were clear: I had to drive perfectly. There were two main standards: a 5-point system and the basic instructions from the secretary or coach. They told me what the boss liked and didn't like, and I had to make sure everything was done perfectly. That was the main focus.

Speaker 1: Let's take a look at today's video recording. We might ask you about your usual driving habits and compare them with the recording. For example, let's talk about your habits when making turns. Our first task after starting the live broadcast was a right turn to enter the side road and adjust the speed. So, could you tell us about your habits when making right and left turns?

Speaker 2: When I leave the house, I usually make a right turn. The first thing I do is check the left side because there might be cars or bicycles coming from that direction. Once I'm sure the left side is clear, I check the right side and then make the turn. That's my usual process for right turns.

Speaker 1: So, you first check the left side for oncoming traffic and then the right side for vehicles moving in the same direction. When you mentioned looking to the left earlier, what exactly were you looking at?

Speaker 2: I wasn't directly looking at the cars; I was using my peripheral vision to scan the mirrors.

Speaker 1: You were checking the mirrors to get a broader view of the left side?

Speaker 2: Yes, exactly. I always scan the mirrors to get the best possible view. It's a habit of mine to scan the entire area because there might be dynamic elements that you could miss otherwise.

Speaker 1: At that point, you were already starting to observe the right side. How long does it usually take you to scan the right side?

Speaker 2: It takes about 18 seconds. After that, I start scanning the right side for any incoming traffic.

Speaker 1: And when you reach the intersection, you check the left side again?

Speaker 2: Yes, because there might be pedestrians crossing the road.
Speaker 2:
Yes.

Speaker 1:
So, when you reached the intersection, you looked to the left, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, because there is a pedestrian crossing here. You must check this first, then observe the traffic on the main road. If everything is clear, you can proceed. Yes, exactly. The navigation system is providing you with city immersion guidance.

Speaker 1:
And ahead, there is a...

Speaker 2:
A parked car and a non-electric bicycle. Please be cautious. Pay attention to the distance between vehicles and the cyclist.

Speaker 1:
You didn't choose to overtake it because...

Speaker 2:
I needed to confirm its stability. Sometimes cyclists can be unpredictable.

Speaker 1:
Right, so you generally avoid overtaking in such situations.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I usually don't overtake unless I feel it's very safe. In 200 meters, turn left.

Speaker 1:
At this point, you felt the distance was safe, and the cyclist moved to the right. Got it. Now, there's a situation where you need to merge onto the main road. Can you describe your usual driving habits when merging from a side road to a main road?

Speaker 2:
For example, when approaching an entrance, the first thing I do is observe the current situation at the entrance.

Speaker 1:
I noticed you start checking the left side mirror quite early, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, at this point, I'm already scanning the area.

Speaker 1:
Even though you can't see the left side road completely yet, you start paying attention.

Speaker 2:
Yes, although the bushes might block the view, you can still see around them. The angle allows you to see, for example, if a bus is coming.

Speaker 1:
So, you can see if there are no cars behind.

Speaker 2:
Yes, it's important to ensure the way is clear. My vehicle has a wide view, so I can see through the car windows as well. We don't just rely on the mirrors; we also look through the left window to check the situation.

Speaker 1:
Right, you check the situation beyond the bushes.

Speaker 2:
Yes, because if a car is taller than the bushes, you can see it. If it's lower and blends in with the surroundings, it can create a blind spot. You need to be cautious since you are merging from a side road to a main road.

Speaker 1:
Understood. This part involves maintaining a steady speed. I noticed you were adjusting the mirrors. Was that during the actual test?

Speaker 2:
Yes, during the test, I adjusted the electronic mirrors again. I remember adjusting them after turning around, but I wasn't completely satisfied. They seemed a bit low, and I felt a bit tense.
**Speaker 1:** When you were test driving, after you made a U-turn, how did you feel about the car's performance?

**Speaker 2:** I felt it was still not quite satisfactory. The car seemed a bit low, and I was a bit nervous. The mirror and the view were not ideal.

**Speaker 1:** Can you describe your driving habits on straight roads with good conditions and low traffic?

**Speaker 2:** If the traffic is light and the straight distance is long enough, say over two kilometers, you can drive smoothly according to the car's design specifications.

**Speaker 1:** What speed do you usually maintain on city roads?

**Speaker 2:** On city roads, I usually keep my speed between 40 and 60 km/h.

**Speaker 1:** What about on roads like the Third or Fourth Ring Road?

**Speaker 2:** On the Third and Fourth Ring Roads, I usually drive at the upper speed limit, which is around 80 to 100 km/h, depending on the traffic flow.

**Speaker 1:** How do you usually maintain your following distance?

**Speaker 2:** On city roads, you need to control your speed and keep a safe distance. For example, at 60 km/h, you should keep a distance of about 70 to 80 meters from the car in front. You can't be too close because it increases the risk of collisions.

**Speaker 1:** What about at 40 km/h?

**Speaker 2:** At 40 km/h, you can be a bit closer, around 50 to 60 meters.

**Speaker 1:** And on highways, if you're driving at 80 or 100 km/h?

**Speaker 2:** On highways, I usually keep a distance of about 100 to 200 meters, especially on the Ring Roads where sudden traffic jams can occur.

**Speaker 1:** When driving on these roads, where do you usually focus your eyes?

**Speaker 2:** I keep my eyes on the road ahead, constantly scanning for any sudden changes in traffic conditions.
Speaker 1:
At that moment, you seemed to be in a hurry, and when you slightly relaxed, you entered the main road.

Speaker 2:
Can I ask where you were looking at that time? It seems like when you were driving straight, you tended to tilt your head a bit. We can see from the video that your head wasn't upright; it was slightly tilted.

Speaker 1:
It's possible that I was carrying something, and the weight at the back was making it uncomfortable. Because there was a change in the lane behind me.

Speaker 2:
I see. Why did you start checking the rearview mirror so early?

Speaker 1:
I had just adjusted the mirror, so I wanted to check the height and compare it with the front and rear views. I don't drive in a fixed manner; I adapt dynamically. I don't focus on a single point; I keep my attention moving to stay alert and avoid drowsiness.

Speaker 2:
Understood. Can you tell me about your usual habits when making a U-turn?

Speaker 1:
I have a habit of making U-turns based on different situations. For example, at a traffic light, I look at the yellow line markings. If there are no dashed lines, I might have to cross the zebra crossing directly. According to traffic laws, this is reasonable. You have to consider lane changes and the presence of other vehicles. If there are dashed lines, you can make the U-turn earlier.

Speaker 2:
Right, you don't have to go all the way to the zebra crossing to make the turn.

Speaker 1:
Exactly, you don't have to force your way through the zebra crossing, which helps alleviate traffic pressure. When making a U-turn, you also need to consider the vehicle's body length and turning radius, as different cars have different turning radii. Some cars have rear-wheel steering, which makes the turning radius very small. For example, some cars can make a U-turn in a single lane, while others, like the Lincoln I'm driving today, might need two lanes due to its length. My other car can make the turn in one and a half lanes. So, the main points are road signs, intersection environment, and vehicle length.

Speaker 2:
How do you usually observe the conditions of other roads and vehicles when making a U-turn?

Speaker 1:
The conditions for making a U-turn include checking if the light is red on your side...
**Speaker 1:** How do you usually observe the conditions of other roads and vehicles?

**Speaker 2:** The first thing to check is whether you have a red or green light. If you're at an intersection, you also need to look for any directional signals.

**Speaker 1:** If there are turn signals or U-turn signals, you need to pay attention to them.

**Speaker 2:** Right. If there are no specific U-turn signals, but there are left-turn and straight-ahead signals, you need to wait for the left-turn signal to turn green before making a U-turn. For example, when we were coming back, we had to wait for the left-turn signal. But if there is no left-turn signal and only red and green lights, you can make a U-turn when the light is green. If you're the first car and the light just turned red, you can make a U-turn because there are dashed lines.

**Speaker 1:** So, you mean you can make a U-turn without passing through the intersection?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, you can make a U-turn without passing through the intersection.

**Speaker 1:** How do you observe other vehicles to determine if it's safe to make a U-turn?

**Speaker 2:** First, you need to check if there are any oncoming vehicles. If you're at a red light, you don't need to worry about oncoming traffic, just the vehicles on your left and right. If there are no right-turning vehicles or oncoming vehicles, you can safely make a U-turn. You also need to consider the vehicles on your right side and whether there are any left-turning vehicles. The status of the traffic lights is crucial. If you have a green light, it means you can proceed, but you need to be cautious about the vehicles around you.

**Speaker 1:** I remember during your test drive, the first attempt was quite challenging.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I had to try it out.

**Speaker 1:** But the second time was much better.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, the second time I took it slower. The car's radar can detect obstacles faster than you can react, and driving too fast can make passengers uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:** So, to ensure passenger comfort during a U-turn, besides slowing down, what else should you pay attention to?

**Speaker 2:** Besides slowing down, you should avoid sudden movements. If you plan to make a U-turn but the car in front of you suddenly brakes, you need to brake gently to avoid jerking the passengers. You should anticipate and control the car smoothly.

**Speaker 1:** So, you need to control the car in advance or ease off the accelerator early.

**Speaker 2:** Exactly.
**Speaker 1:**
When another driver suddenly brakes, you also need to brake to prevent passengers from being jolted. You need to maintain control.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, you need to anticipate and control the car by easing off the accelerator in advance.

**Speaker 1:**
Right, controlling the car smoothly helps maintain the vehicle's stability and ensures passenger comfort.

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly. This part of the drive involves a straight-line acceleration after a U-turn. Can you describe your usual acceleration habits in such scenarios? Specifically, how do you control the throttle?

**Speaker 1:**
When accelerating in a straight line after a U-turn, I always consider the road conditions. If the road is safe, I accelerate gradually rather than suddenly. In urban areas, even if there are no direct intersections, there could be bus stops, gaps in the green belts, or pedestrians, children, and elderly people who might suddenly appear. Delivery riders are also a concern. So, maintaining a high level of caution is crucial.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, caution is key. In such situations, I always accelerate slowly. Are there any special circumstances where you would accelerate differently?

**Speaker 1:**
No, in straight-line acceleration, I stick to the principle of accelerating gradually. If the situation allows, I might accelerate faster, but generally, I prefer to be cautious.

**Speaker 2:**
During the formal experiment, did you perform any lane changes or overtaking maneuvers? If not, could you describe your usual habits in these situations?

**Speaker 1:**
I don't recall any lane changes or overtaking during the experiment. Could you describe your usual approach to lane changes and overtaking?

**Speaker 2:**
When I need to change lanes or overtake, if the vehicle in front is moving too slowly and the traffic on my left and right is sparse, I consider the safety conditions and then proceed to change lanes and overtake. I only do this when it's safe.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you explain how you observe and judge the conditions for overtaking? What is your process?

**Speaker 2:**
First, I look at the vehicle in front. I might slightly turn the steering wheel to get a better view of the road ahead. This helps me assess the situation.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you slightly steer to the left to get a better view, even if it means slightly crossing the line?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, just a bit to get a clearer view.
**Speaker 1:**
When you were overtaking, what were the conditions of the cars in front of you?

**Speaker 2:**
I would slightly veer to the left, just a bit, maybe even touching the line a little.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you would take a look at the situation of the cars ahead, not just the one directly in front of you.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I would first glance at the state of the traffic ahead. It's not just about the car directly in front of me, but also whether there are any stationary or slow-moving vehicles. While observing, I would also scan the left lane to see if it's clear. If the car in front is slow or not moving, and the left lane is clear, I would check the distance of the car behind me. If there's a safe distance, I would change lanes and continue forward. If there are issues in the new lane, I would adjust accordingly. Generally, the environment dictates the need for such maneuvers.

**Speaker 1:**
So, this is your observation before overtaking. During the overtaking process, what else do you pay attention to?

**Speaker 2:**
During the process, I would...

**Speaker 1:**
What specific actions do you take to ensure both safety and speed during overtaking?

**Speaker 2:**
The details...

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, the details. During overtaking, you need to change lanes quickly, which can make passengers uncomfortable. What are the specific details you focus on?

**Speaker 2:**
As I mentioned earlier, once everything is clear, I would first signal. When signaling, I would ease off the accelerator, not press it. After signaling, I would change lanes with a light touch on the accelerator. At the same time, I would keep an eye on the car in front to ensure it doesn't change lanes as well. Sometimes, just as you start to change lanes, the car in front might do the same, leading to a potential collision. So, it's crucial to monitor the car ahead for any lane-changing tendencies. If it's clear, I would proceed with the lane change.

**Speaker 1:**
These details are very interesting. When we discuss further, please continue to share such detailed insights. It's very helpful.

**Speaker 2:**
Sure, if we're talking about turning or entering an auxiliary lane, there are also specific details to consider.

**Speaker 1:**
For example, when turning or entering a lane, what specific details do you focus on?

**Speaker 2:**
When turning, whether it's with or without passengers...
Speaker 2:
In terms of details, for example, when we are making a turn or merging, we need to be cautious.

Speaker 1:
You mean turning, merging into traffic.

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. Are we talking about merging into traffic?

Speaker 1:
Yes, but we haven't started turning yet.

Speaker 2:
Right, when you exit the parking lot, there's a barrier, correct? You need to stop and observe both sides. If it's clear, then you can proceed. At that moment, your foot should be on the brake. After observing, if everything is clear...

Speaker 1:
You mean at this point...

Speaker 2:
Yes, at this point, your foot should be on the brake. Once you have checked both sides and it's safe, you move your foot from the brake to the accelerator, but you don't press it. You rely on the car's idle speed to move. If there are no cars coming from the side, as you enter the lane, your speed should be slightly higher than idle speed. Once you move forward a bit, you can release the accelerator. If your foot is already on the brake, you might need to press it gently or smoothly. If it's clear, you can make the turn. This includes easing off the accelerator. If you need to slow down, gently press the brake. Don't press it too hard, as it might cause a sudden stop. Generally, the habit is to release the accelerator first and then use the brake if needed.

Speaker 1:
Hmm, when entering the main road...

Speaker 2:
When entering the main road, you usually release the accelerator and let the car move slowly. Observe the situation around you. If everything is clear, you can gently press the accelerator to increase speed. If there are no obstacles or dangers, you can press the accelerator a bit more.

Speaker 1:
Yes, at this point, you need to press the accelerator a bit more.

Speaker 2:
It depends on the situation. If there are no obstacles or dangers, and the distance between cars is safe, you can increase your speed a bit. You don't need to rush.

Speaker 1:
I understand. Let's go back to the previous point, near the turning point. Are there any additional details?

Speaker 2:
When making a U-turn within 10 meters, we have covered most of the discussion.

Speaker 1:
And this is just before the right turn, correct?

Speaker 2:
Yes, preparing to enter. You will reach the turning point in 40 meters.

Speaker 1:
At this point, why did you glance to the left?

Speaker 2:
I was checking the cars behind.
Speaker 1: You are about to reach a waypoint, and in 40 meters, you will need to turn right.

Speaker 1: Why did you just glance to the left?

Speaker 2: I was checking the distance of the vehicle behind me.

Speaker 1: Even though you are turning right, you still habitually check the left side. Why is that?

Speaker 2: I do it to be cautious. Sometimes, a car from the left lane might speed up and try to overtake me from the right, which can be dangerous.

Speaker 1: I understand.

Speaker 2: So, it's important to be aware of that.

Speaker 1: To see if the car behind has any intention of overtaking. Right.

Speaker 2: Yes, exactly. Although we are still 40 meters away, with experience, you develop an instinct for these things.

Speaker 1: At this point, you should also check the right rearview mirror to assess the situation.

Speaker 2: Yes, to monitor the speed of other vehicles, including motorcycles and bicycles. I also keep my foot ready on the brake, just in case.

Speaker 1: Do you find it difficult to see clearly with glasses on?

Speaker 2: Yes, sometimes I have to strain to see if there are any vehicles in the blind spots, especially in the C and D pillars.

Speaker 1: In 250 meters, you will reach the waypoint, and in 20 meters, you will need to turn right.

Speaker 1: So, when you turn right, do you first check the left side or the right rearview mirror?

Speaker 2: When I turn right, I first look straight ahead to check for any oncoming traffic. Then, I check the right side for any bicycles or pedestrians.

Speaker 1: So, you first observe the right side for any potential hazards.

Speaker 2: Yes, because bicycles can pose a danger.

Speaker 1: And then you check the right rearview mirror.

Speaker 2: Yes, I keep an eye on the situation to ensure it's safe to proceed. If there are any left-turning vehicles or crossing bicycles, I wait until they pass.

Speaker 1: When you reach the waypoint, you quickly glance to the left again, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, just to make sure there are no sudden changes.

Speaker 1: Even while turning, you still check the left side.

Speaker 2: Yes, just in case a vehicle suddenly appears.

Speaker 1: Understood. Now, let me ask you some other questions. To ensure safety during this experiment, what do you particularly focus on while driving?

Speaker 2: Based on this experiment...

Speaker 1: Considering the previous discussions we had...
**Interviewer:** When it comes to driving safety, what specific aspects do you pay special attention to while driving?

**Driver:** Based on this experience, I would say the main focus is on ensuring safety.

**Interviewer:** Right, because as we discussed earlier, safety is paramount.

**Driver:** Yes, especially when dealing with red lights. During the holiday season, for instance, I make sure to add extra caution. I try to avoid any mistakes, whether they are related to our vehicle or external factors. Throughout the process, I remain steadfast in maintaining safety.

**Interviewer:** So, to ensure the safety of your passengers, what specific measures do you take that are different from your usual routine?

**Driver:** I tend to drive more slowly than usual. The roads can be bumpy, and the vehicle itself is quite rigid. When driving on uneven surfaces or potholes, I am extra cautious. For example, in Beijing, there are certain areas where the road conditions can cause discomfort. I remember a time when a passenger almost fell asleep due to the smoothness of the ride, but the bumps woke them up.

**Interviewer:** So, you believe that uneven roads can make passengers feel unsafe due to the bumps?

**Driver:** Yes, it can make them feel uneasy. It's more about discomfort than actual safety. By reducing speed, I aim to minimize this discomfort while still ensuring safety.

**Interviewer:** Let's talk about making a left turn. Can you describe your approach to making a left turn in detail?

**Driver:** When making a left turn, the first thing I focus on is checking for oncoming traffic. I also look out for any pedestrians or vehicles coming from the left side. Additionally, I pay attention to the right side, especially if there are crosswalks or pedestrians crossing. Once I have checked all these points and ensured it's safe, I proceed with the turn slowly and cautiously.
Speaker 1:
Basically, you need to get the car moving again, slowly according to the situation. If everything is fine, yes, that's the way to adapt.

Speaker 1:
Now, here you need to make a left turn. Yes, a left turn. So, first, look to the right. Look to the right first, then check the left to see if there's anyone coming from that direction.

Speaker 2:
Strategy-wise, you need to turn back a bit more. How much more? Depending on the situation, there's an entrance here. Yes, it looks like someone might be coming out, so let's check first. The road is narrow, and as long as my car doesn't block the other side, it should be fine. When you encounter such roads, you need to be cautious and follow small steps according to the scenario. Turn left at the end of the road. You'll arrive in 700 meters.

Speaker 1:
Sir, what do you think makes driving safer? Or based on your current driving experience, what additional measures can be taken for safety?

Speaker 2:
If you want to enhance safety based on this driving experience, I can't think of anything specific at the moment. The current route we are test-driving is handled according to my driving experience. For such roads, my speed is usually between 20-30 km/h, not exceeding 40 km/h. Especially when entering gates or narrow alleys, you need to slow down. If you drive at 50 km/h without braking and hit a pedestrian, the fatality rate is 60%. So, on such roads, 20-30 km/h is the most appropriate speed. Don't rush; you need to stay calm and avoid causing frustration for yourself. If you make a mistake, it might not cause an accident today, but it could tomorrow.

Speaker 1:
Can you recall any situations or scenarios while driving that you found particularly frightening?

Speaker 2:
I particularly dislike scenarios where the road is even narrower, about one-third of this width, and there's a farmers' market on the street with various vehicles parked on the sides.

Speaker 1:
Like the alleys inside the Second Ring Road in Beijing?

Speaker 2:
Yes, but even worse. Let me tell you about a scenario during the May Day holiday when I went on a trip to Baiyangdian. To get to the dock, you have to go through a village, and there were a lot of cars because it was a holiday.
**Speaker 1:**
Can you describe a driving scenario you experienced during the May Day holiday when you went on a trip to Baiyangling and Baiyangdian?

**Speaker 2:**
Sure, we had to drive through a village to reach the pier. It was a busy tourist season, and the roads were very narrow. The village had houses, shops, and small markets along the roadside. There were people selling fish, chicken, and vegetables, with elderly folks setting up stalls right by the road. The road was so narrow that if you tried to avoid the stalls, you would block the oncoming traffic. It was quite chaotic, with cars stuck and some roadwork going on, making it even worse. I really dislike such roads because it feels like you're driving right through people's lives. At one point, someone leaned on my car while chatting, and it was very stressful.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you feel particularly scared in certain situations?

**Speaker 2:**
Not necessarily scared, but I do feel unsafe.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, it makes you nervous. When you're nervous, driving becomes difficult. You end up in a stop-and-go situation, moving very slowly. We were trying to get through the village, but the road was blocked, so we had to take another route, which was even narrower. Cars were lined up, and I had to fold my side mirrors to the maximum to squeeze through. The houses were built on slopes, making it even more challenging.

**Speaker 1:**
I understand.

**Speaker 2:**
The cars were lined up, and I had to drive with one wheel on the edge of the road to get through. It was very tight.

**Speaker 1:**
Besides such situations, are there other scenarios that make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, there are other situations, like driving in low visibility.

**Speaker 1:**
In the city, do you encounter situations that make you feel scared?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really. I'm quite familiar with city driving.

**Speaker 1:**
Have you ever had a driving experience that still scares you when you think about it?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, there are risky places, especially at intersections without traffic signals. These are often in suburban areas where accidents are more likely to happen.
**Speaker 1:**
Alright, let me check the situation. It says here that it's a rather complex scenario, and the road is blocked, but you still need to make a left turn.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, there was a car stopped in the middle of the road, not following the rules, blocking the intersection.

**Speaker 1:**
Did the driver get out of the car?

**Speaker 2:**
No, he didn't. I had to honk at him to get his attention. Eventually, he moved a bit, but it was still difficult to pass. Another car was also trying to get through, making it even more challenging.

**Speaker 1:**
So, both of you were trying to get through?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. We were both trying to navigate the situation.

**Speaker 1:**
What was the reason you couldn't get through?

**Speaker 2:**
The car was blocking the way, and I needed to move forward. There was no space to maneuver. The other driver had to reverse a bit to create enough space for me to turn left.

**Speaker 1:**
Was the other driver also trying to turn right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, he was trying to turn right while I was trying to turn left.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you determine who should yield in that situation?

**Speaker 2:**
It wasn't really about who should yield. I just needed to make him aware that he was blocking the intersection. He was stationary, blocking the way. I honked to let him know he needed to move. Once he reversed, I had enough space to make my turn. If he hadn't moved, neither of us would have been able to proceed.

**Speaker 1:**
I see. Do you think you have any bad driving habits that could potentially cause danger?

**Speaker 2:**
I wouldn't say I have bad driving habits now, but back in the early 2000s, when I first started driving, I didn't have much practical experience. I learned to drive in 1996, but I didn't start driving regularly until 2001. When I got my first car, I was so inexperienced that I had my father-in-law drive it home from the dealership. The roads were narrow, and I wasn't confident enough to drive myself. It took me several years to become comfortable behind the wheel.
**Speaker 1:**
Let me ask you about a specific situation. For example, if there's a large vehicle in front of you blocking your view, and you can't see what's happening behind it, how would you handle such a scenario?

**Speaker 2:**
This is similar to what I mentioned earlier about making a left turn. When there are vehicles on both the left and right sides, the only solution is to slow down and gradually approach the vehicle in front to observe the situation. You can't just stay still; you need to slowly get closer and assess the situation.

**Speaker 1:**
Let's take a step back and consider a longer observation period. During this time, you would already be observing the situation, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I would already be observing.

**Speaker 1:**
When you're a passenger in someone else's car, what are some of the bad driving habits that make you feel nervous or unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**
There are quite a few. When I'm a passenger, I usually don't criticize the driver because it can be disrespectful and make them anxious. It's common for drivers to get annoyed if you constantly tell them how to drive. For example, if someone is driving in a mixed-traffic lane, I might suggest they stay to the right to avoid obstructing other vehicles. Mixed-traffic lanes can be tricky because they often have both motor vehicles and cyclists. If a driver doesn't pay attention, it can be dangerous for the cyclists, who are more vulnerable. So, I try to give simple advice without being too critical.

**Speaker 1:**
It's important to be cautious. Feel free to share any other situations where you feel nervous or uneasy as a passenger.
Speaker 1:
You can explore everything, it's okay, haha. Yes, if you feel there's something that makes you nervous or uneasy when others are driving, you don't have to say it if you don't want to.

Speaker 2:
Some people drive aggressively, which means they drive too fast and have a bad temper. When there are many cars, they not only get anxious but also start cursing. This is definitely a no-no. For example, someone who accelerates and brakes harshly. I've experienced this with friends. If you ride with them, you definitely won't feel comfortable, especially if you get car sick. This kind of driving habit is really bad and can be quite annoying.

Speaker 2:
Another issue is what I mentioned earlier about my wife. She has a habit of swerving to the right to avoid cars, which can easily lead to entering the wrong lane or creating a hazard. Also, some people don't like to use their turn signals, which is not acceptable.

Speaker 1:
Not using turn signals, right. Okay, let's continue with this video. Here we are at an intersection without traffic lights. This is an important part of our road. In the next 30 meters, you need to turn. Can you tell me what you were looking at during this segment? Because it seems like you were looking at something specific.

Speaker 2:
I was actually looking ahead at the entrance. I started preparing for the intersection in advance.

Speaker 1:
At this point, you were looking to the left at the pedestrians, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, and then I looked at the cars on the left.

Speaker 1:
In the next 200 meters, you need to turn right. Were you checking the right side mirror or looking at the cars on the right?

Speaker 2:
I was looking at the cars on the right.

Speaker 1:
Got it. In 200 meters, at the traffic light, you need to turn right.

Speaker 2:
Right.

Speaker 1:
Let me ask you, do you usually pay attention to the passengers' experience when you drive? I know as a professional driver, you definitely consider your boss's experience. But besides that, do you also consider other passengers?

Speaker 2:
Yes, at home as well.

Speaker 1:
Do you also pay attention to other aspects?

Speaker 2:
Yes, definitely.

Speaker 1:
What aspects do you focus on?

Speaker 2:
Mainly on the comfort of the ride, like the speed and smoothness of starting and stopping. For example, my elderly family members get car sick, so I have to be mindful of that.
Speaker 1:
So, it's about speed and smooth acceleration. For example, my grandmother gets car sick easily. You need to be mindful of that and avoid sudden movements. If she experiences frequent jolts, it becomes uncomfortable for her. My wife, on the other hand, is fine because she drives herself.

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. For important clients, you need to focus on their experience. Besides maintaining a steady speed and avoiding bumps, you should keep the car quiet and clean. Are there any other details you pay attention to?

Speaker 1:
Yes, the movements should not be too abrupt.

Speaker 2:
Right, we call that smooth driving.

Speaker 1:
So, it's about the amplitude of the car's movements. The car's posture is related to speed, but speed is just one part of it.

Speaker 2:
Exactly. When driving in a straight line, you shouldn't keep changing speeds. Sudden acceleration or deceleration affects the car's posture. For example, when you accelerate, the car moves forward, and when you brake, it moves backward. This is part of the car's movement amplitude. U-turns also fall into this category. It's about making the ride comfortable by minimizing these movements. When you turn, the car's inertia makes passengers feel the movement. You need to smooth out these movements to make the ride comfortable.

Speaker 2:
Yes, but the key to making the ride comfortable is maintaining a steady axis. It's not just about the maximum speed; it's about how you handle the car at different speeds, like 10 degrees or 70 degrees.

Speaker 1:
I often hear you talk about smooth driving. How do you achieve that in practice?

Speaker 2:
For example, when you turn the steering wheel, you need to make small adjustments rather than large, abrupt ones. Smooth driving is about making these small adjustments, whether you're turning left or right. Even when making a U-turn, you should turn the wheel gradually. Sudden, sharp turns can damage the steering mechanism. You need to consider whether the vehicle can handle such movements. Everything should be done smoothly, including braking.
Speaker 1:
It might damage the wheel if you make a sudden turn, which is not good for the steering mechanism. You need to consider if the vehicle can handle it. Everything should be smooth. Why do you apply the brakes? Earlier, when we were talking, you mentioned that the distance between the cars seemed a bit large to you. But having a larger distance can be beneficial as it allows for smoother driving. Why is smoothness important? When you brake, it’s about maintaining a safe distance from the car in front of you.

Speaker 2:
Yes, having enough distance allows you to brake gradually.

Speaker 1:
What do you mean by gradual braking? When you press the pedal lightly, the brake pads just start to make contact. This is similar to using a half-clutch when starting in first gear. Have you learned about half-clutch?

Speaker 2:
Yes, half-clutch or partial engagement. By using partial friction, you gradually move to full friction. This is what we mean by smoothness. Your foot should move in sync with the wheel to achieve this.

Speaker 1:
Yes, with the clutch, you can feel the gears engaging and the vibrations coming through.

Speaker 2:
Exactly. Experienced drivers, especially in Beijing, understand this. What does it mean to drive smoothly? It means your foot and the brake pedal are in sync. You can feel how much pressure to apply. When you drive, you don’t need to pay too much attention to small bumps; you just adjust naturally. You don’t need to be overly cautious. Isn’t that right? You should be confident and make small adjustments as needed.

Speaker 1:
Besides the steering wheel and brakes, what other aspects contribute to a smooth driving experience?

Speaker 2:
Mainly, it’s these two aspects. They control the car’s movement. If you manage the car’s dynamics well, passengers will feel comfortable. If the car isn’t moving smoothly, it won’t be comfortable. Once the car is moving, you need to consider various factors, including road conditions. Avoid obstacles when you can, and slow down for speed bumps. Some people don’t slow down enough for speed bumps, thinking that going 10 mph is slow enough, but it’s not. The car’s suspension plays a role here. For example, with our car, you need to approach speed bumps slowly to avoid a jarring experience.

Speaker 1:
So, it’s about managing the car’s movement up and down, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, it’s about ensuring a smooth ride. When you approach a speed bump, you should do so slowly and carefully. This way, the car and passengers experience a gradual change in motion. This approach applies to various driving scenarios, ensuring a comfortable ride.
**Speaker 1:**
Did you notice the scenery? Brother Qiang mentioned that you always approach the scenery slowly, then pass, and then follow the standard strategy. This method includes previous pickups, where they mentioned their app, and they would always go to the hotel for checks. There were no standards in between, but he did say that if you put a glass of water there, it wouldn't spill because of your driving.

**Speaker 1:**
Let's take a look at the video. Here, you need to make a right turn onto the North Fourth Ring Road.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's correct.

**Speaker 1:**
The Fourth Ring Road. Okay, make a right turn.

**Speaker 2:**
Then we arrive near the classic route.

**Speaker 1:**
At that time, you observed the right side of the road early on, so near the scenic spot, you didn't look much at the subsequent traffic. Did you also check the left side?

**Speaker 2:**
The first time I checked the right side, I looked through the rearview mirror and assessed the situation. I had already ruled it out.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you didn't check the left side much this time, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Because we were following the regulations for that area. We were about 350 meters away from the scenic spot.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, let me ask you this: Do you think you have any bad driving habits that might make passengers uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
We were about to arrive at the destination, just a few meters away.

**Speaker 1:**
If not, when you ride in someone else's car, are there any driving habits that make you uncomfortable? Previously, I asked about safety. Now, I'm asking about habits that might make you uncomfortable.

**Speaker 2:**
Making others uncomfortable is rare in a work setting. It's like an occupational hazard. For example, if someone drives aggressively, it can create a sense of unease. If they suddenly accelerate or brake, it can cause a feeling of being thrown around. Also, if a driver is overly focused on the road, they might anticipate risks that the passenger doesn't see, creating unnecessary tension.

**Speaker 1:**
So, because the perspectives of the passenger and the driver are different, the passenger might feel there's a danger that the driver doesn't notice. This can make the passenger anxious.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it can make the passenger feel both uncomfortable and tense. The passenger might feel uneasy because they noticed something the driver didn't, leading to a psychological discomfort.
**Speaker 2:**
Feeling uncomfortable and nervous, right? Uncomfortable and nervous. We need to guide the passengers psychologically. They might feel uneasy, but at the same time, they will also feel uncomfortable because of this.

**Speaker 1:**
So, how should we address this situation?

**Speaker 2:**
In this situation, you need to...

**Speaker 1:**
Should we inform them that the driver has noticed it, or what should we do?

**Speaker 2:**
To avoid this situation, you must drive according to the rules. Drive as carefully as possible. For instance, you need to slow down where necessary. The tension for passengers usually comes from two points: one is when the car in front is too close, making them feel unsafe, and the other is their preference to sit on the right side. Whether it's parallel or slightly behind, they tend to focus more on the right side. You need to consider the surroundings, especially on the right side, to ensure there are no issues. For example, if there are parked cars on the road, you should be cautious. If you were sitting on the right side, wouldn't you be concerned if the car suddenly sped up?

**Speaker 1:**
What driving habits make you feel uncomfortable when you are a passenger in someone else's car?

**Speaker 2:**
Uncomfortable habits are those that make me feel unsafe. Both feelings of discomfort and insecurity are intertwined. If I feel unsafe, it’s usually because the driver is not following the rules. For instance, if the car is too close to others or if the driver is making sudden movements.

**Speaker 1:**
We gave the passengers a handle to press if they felt uncomfortable. We can review the data later. Shall we continue watching the video?

**Speaker 2:**
Sure. During today's experiment, I emphasized treating the passengers as important guests. During the drive, I focused on two main aspects: safety and comfort.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you specify what aspects of comfort you focused on?

**Speaker 2:**
Comfort mainly involves the car's stability and minimizing bumps. These are the primary factors. Additionally, understanding the different needs of passengers is crucial.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you think you can make passengers feel more comfortable while driving?

**Speaker 2:**
Initially, it’s about maintaining a smooth and steady drive. I didn't focus on the time but rather on the comfort and safety of the passengers.
**Speaker 1:** How can we make passengers feel more comfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Initially, I didn't really focus on that aspect. I didn't pay much attention to it at the time.

**Speaker 1:** Is there any way to further improve it? Earlier, we discussed safety and how to make passengers feel safer. Now, I'm asking how we can make them feel more comfortable based on the current situation.

**Speaker 2:** I've worked in 15 countries. Making passengers more comfortable isn't just about the driver; it also involves the car's hardware. For example, with the new energy Avita, I could make the rear cabin more comfortable. I might add features that passengers can enjoy daily.

**Speaker 1:** What are the risks involved?

**Speaker 2:** Enhancing comfort isn't just about driving. For instance, many MPVs I've modified have features like a conference room in the back, similar to the Mercedes V2.0. The rear windows can be lowered, and there's a partition for privacy. It's like a mobile bar for comfort. If I make the interior luxurious, add a karaoke system, and provide coffee, it enhances the experience. However, a standard car can't achieve that level of comfort. Even if the driver is excellent, the car's amenities play a significant role in overall comfort.

**Speaker 1:** The next few questions might be a bit more challenging. Please think carefully before answering. The first question is, what do you think makes a good or professional driver?

**Speaker 2:** This question isn't too difficult. A good driver should first and foremost have a strong sense of responsibility. Safety awareness is crucial, especially in busy areas like Beijing. A good driver should understand and control the vehicle well. Professional drivers need to demonstrate advanced skills and professionalism. For example, a business driver should excel in business etiquette and have excellent driving skills. You can't be a good driver without knowing how to handle the car and guide passengers properly.

**Speaker 1:** What should a professional driver focus on in terms of driving?

**Speaker 2:** A professional driver should have proficient driving skills. This means understanding the mechanical principles and components of the vehicle.
**Speaker 1:**
First and foremost, your driving skills need to be proficient. What does proficiency mean? It means you need to have a thorough understanding of the vehicle's mechanics and components. You need to have a high level of awareness about the car. That's the first point. The second point is that you need to have valuable driving experience. You probably need at least 3 to 5 years of practical driving experience to reach a professional level. Additionally, you need to have relevant experience, not just driving a truck. For instance, driving a truck is different from driving a passenger vehicle, especially in scenarios where you need to handle different types of cargo.

**Speaker 1:**
Let's look at the right turn. At that time, the rearview mirror wasn't really useful. You had to look through the left window to see the situation on the left side of the vehicle, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's correct.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you didn't check the right rearview mirror in that situation?

**Speaker 2:**
No, because I was driving close to the right side. There were bicycles and pedestrians ahead. I had already noticed them and adjusted my position accordingly. The two vehicles on the right were no longer a concern.

**Speaker 1:**
In situations where a non-motorized vehicle is originally in your right lane and suddenly changes lanes to cut in front of you, how do you handle it? How do you judge the intentions of such vehicles, which might make unpredictable moves?

**Speaker 2:**
I can usually judge from the rider's posture and behavior. For instance, if they are riding close to the curb, I slow down my vehicle.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you make that judgment?

**Speaker 2:**
Because they consistently stay close to the curb and don't move outward. This behavior suggests they might make sudden moves.

**Speaker 1:**
So, they are always close to the motor vehicle lane?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, you need to observe their body language and any changes in their behavior.

**Speaker 1:**
At what point do you usually determine that they might not stay in their lane?

**Speaker 2:**
As soon as they overtake me, I start to pay closer attention.

**Speaker 1:**
Can we take a closer look and identify the exact moment you realized they were going to leave the non-motorized lane and move left?

**Speaker 2:**
Actually, you can already see some signs now. There are subtle indications.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you identify those signs?

**Speaker 2:**
By observing their movements and the way they navigate the road.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you adjust the seat and show us more clearly?

**Speaker 2:**
Sure, let's play the footage again and analyze it.
Speaker 2:
When we designed this, we considered various aspects.

Speaker 1:
We can adjust the seats, and everything will fit together.

Speaker 2:
Let's play it again. It's not clear in the diagram, but when I was driving, he was looking this way.

Speaker 1:
Let me see if I can capture it. I think it's possible. Yes, he will appear from the side soon.

Speaker 2:
Yes, he first overtook aggressively from this side. After overtaking, I didn't accelerate; I maintained a constant speed. There were traffic lights, and he kept changing lanes.

Speaker 1:
Just tell me when to stop.

Speaker 2:
Stop, stop, stop. Right here, he turned his head. It wasn't just a glance; he kept looking this way.

Speaker 1:
Was it at this moment?

Speaker 2:
Yes, he turned his head here. There was another car parked, so he had to move forward and make space. This made his driving unpredictable, affecting my driving.

Speaker 1:
So you just followed him, not daring to accelerate and overtake?

Speaker 2:
Yes, in my plan, he was an unpredictable driver.

Speaker 1:
I just kept going. What about these two cars?

Speaker 2:
These two cars were not a problem.

Speaker 1:
You could judge that they were stable?

Speaker 2:
Yes.

Speaker 1:
So you didn't worry about them getting too close or veering into your lane?

Speaker 2:
No, because they were communicating and moving forward. I was driving straight, but not slowly. I signaled and turned right at the end of the road, entering the main road. They turned left, and I checked for oncoming traffic before turning.

Speaker 1:
Got it. Now, let me ask you, what do you think is the biggest difference between experienced and novice drivers?

Speaker 2:
It's their level of attention. Experienced drivers handle situations and observe more comprehensively, while novices are slower to react and may only focus on one side.

Speaker 1:
Can you be more specific?

Speaker 2:
Novices often lack a comprehensive view. They might only look left and not right, or vice versa. This is due to their lack of confidence and high levels of nervousness. We've all been beginners, so we know how it feels. Novice drivers are highly tense and can't manage multiple things at once.

Speaker 1:
This ties into what you mentioned earlier about dynamic observation.
Speaker 1:
New drivers tend to be highly nervous, which affects their ability to manage multiple tasks simultaneously. They can't keep an eye on everything around them.

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. As I mentioned earlier, experienced drivers constantly scan their surroundings, looking in all directions. New drivers, on the other hand, often focus on just one direction and miss what's happening elsewhere.

Speaker 1:
So, it's like new drivers have tunnel vision, while experienced drivers have a broader view, almost like a scanning device that can multitask. New drivers can only focus on one thing at a time, while experienced drivers can divide their attention and observe multiple things simultaneously. Some people ask me if I look at the mirrors or the road. The truth is, I look at everything. I glance at the mirrors quickly and then focus back on the road.

Speaker 2:
Exactly. Now, the next question might be a bit challenging. What aspects of driving do you think autonomous vehicles will never be able to match human capabilities?

Speaker 1:
This is a common topic of discussion among drivers.

Speaker 2:
The main reason artificial intelligence can't fully replace human drivers is the lack of emotional connection. It might sound strange, but driving involves a certain level of emotional engagement. There's a connection to the car, a concern for safety, and an ability to imagine different scenarios. AI operates purely on algorithms and data, which can't replicate the human experience. For example, AI might use data from various sources to make decisions, but it lacks the intuitive judgment that humans have.

Speaker 1:
Can you give an example?

Speaker 2:
Take automatic parking, for instance. An autonomous car can park itself, but it does so conservatively. A human driver might be able to park in two or three attempts, while the AI might take longer to ensure it's done perfectly. It's not that the AI is inefficient; it's just more cautious in its calculations.

Speaker 1:
So, you're saying that while a human might complete parking in two or three tries, the AI might take longer but ensures it's done correctly?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. From start to finish, a human might be quicker in some situations because they can take calculated risks that AI avoids.
Speaker 1:
Let's start by parking the car. From the beginning to the end, efficiency is key for a successful automatic parking. 

Speaker 2:
What do you think is the reason?

Speaker 1:
The reason lies in the algorithm, which takes into account the complexity of the surrounding environment. This complexity is combined with various sensors like radar, whether it's millimeter-wave or infrared, and also the front-facing camera. These systems assess whether it's safe to turn the wheel more or less. When a human controls the car, the feel and precision are different. For instance, when I park, I might only have one parking spot to work with. Especially during test drives, there are usually no other cars around.

Speaker 2:
Yes, it can handle that. But when you have a real-world scenario with other cars around, it becomes more challenging. If you switch to a less experienced driver, they might struggle to park continuously without stopping. We need to consider a driver who is proficient in normal driving conditions. The automatic parking system still needs to account for the front, back, and sides, and ensure it avoids any obstacles or people.

Speaker 1:
The video ends here as we return to the parking lot. I have two more questions. These questions focus on how you, as a driver, judge the intentions of pedestrians, non-motorized vehicles, and motor vehicles on the road. This is a crucial aspect for us. I'm curious, in scenarios like the one we just discussed, where a sudden change occurs, how do you predict the intentions of others on the road? Let's start with pedestrians.

Speaker 2:
When judging pedestrians, you can often get a sense of their intentions. Some people might not signal with their hands, but their body language can give clues. For example, if they want to cross the street or move in a certain direction, their gaze and body orientation will indicate their intentions.

Speaker 1:
So, they look where they want to go?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. They will look in the direction they intend to move.

Speaker 1:
Do they look first or move first?

Speaker 2:
Most of the time, they look first. They will glance in the direction they want to go before moving.

Speaker 1:
So, they look first, then move.

Speaker 2:
Yes, that's the usual pattern. It's rare to see someone move without looking at all. It does happen, but it's uncommon. They might be distracted or forget to check their surroundings. For cyclists and electric bike riders, it's even more critical. They often...
Speaker 1:
I forgot to observe my surroundings. When it comes to bicycles and electric bikes, they can be quite unpredictable. Sometimes, if you notice a bike swaying left and right, you need to pay attention. Regardless of whether they are paying attention to you, you must be cautious and not get too close. First, check if they are stable, or use your horn to alert them. Then proceed carefully. 

There was also a situation where a man overtook two cars, and I felt uneasy about it. So, I decided to follow him for a bit. We weren't in a hurry that day, so I waited until we passed the construction site before making any moves. If there's an issue, it's better to be patient and ensure safety.

Speaker 2:
Yes, especially with motor vehicles.

Speaker 1:
How do you judge the intentions of other motor vehicles on the road? Besides obvious signals like turn signals and brake lights, there are many subtle cues. 

Speaker 2:
Exactly. Sometimes, when you're driving and the car in front of you doesn't signal but suddenly changes lanes, you need to be prepared. In such cases, maintain a safe following distance. If the car in front doesn't move, signal your intention and proceed cautiously. Especially on ring roads, you need to be vigilant. If you assume the car won't change lanes and it does, an accident can occur. You need to verify the situation in a short amount of time. Even if you signal, the other driver might not.

Speaker 1:
You mentioned earlier about sticking your head out to check. That's a form of verification, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, it's to verify if there's a traffic jam ahead, which might slow down the traffic. It also helps to see if the car in front will change speed. If you slightly move your car, the driver behind you will notice and might adjust their actions accordingly. Observing the speed and distance of the car in front is crucial. Don't just focus on the car directly ahead; look further down the road. If the road is clear, you can maintain a tighter following distance. If there's a red light ahead, adjust your speed accordingly.

Speaker 2:
Following closely and making adjustments are essential.
**Speaker 1:**
If you keep your speed in line with the SUV, you can maintain a tight control. If the light ahead turns red, well, that's not ideal, you know that.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, maintaining a consistent following distance is important. Also, when the car behind you is trying to overtake, sometimes they don't signal. If you want to change lanes, make sure it's clear ahead of you. If the car behind you suddenly changes lanes without signaling, you should hold your position and not change lanes. This can help avoid potential dangers. Additionally, always be aware of cars in your left or right rear blind spots.

**Speaker 1:**
You need to see if they are planning to move into your lane, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly. When you signal, check your rearview mirror to see if the car behind you is accelerating. Some drivers have a tendency to speed up when they see your signal, trying to prevent you from changing lanes. If you don't signal, they might slow down. It's a psychological thing; they don't want you to cut in front of them.

**Speaker 1:**
They want to get ahead of you. If you want to change lanes, they prefer you to do it behind them, not in front.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's the idea. It's similar to people's personalities.

**Speaker 1:**
You need to gauge their personality. Will they let you in, or will they try to block you?

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly. For instance, some drivers, regardless of gender, might not want to let you in. In such cases, you need to be cautious. On highways, if you signal and see the other car accelerating, let them pass first. If they maintain their speed, then you can change lanes. It's all about coordination and understanding the behavior of other drivers.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, I have one last question for today. Imagine a scenario where you are at an intersection without traffic lights. You are driving and need to cross the road, and there are pedestrians also trying to cross. Both of you see each other and hesitate, thinking the other will go first. You both stop, then both decide to go at the same time. Have you encountered such situations? How do you handle them?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I've encountered this many times, especially at intersections without traffic lights and with pedestrian crossings. When this happens, I usually stop and make eye contact with the pedestrian to signal my intention. If they stop, I proceed slowly. If they continue walking, I wait for them to cross. It's all about clear communication and ensuring safety for both parties.
Interviewer: Have you encountered situations where there are no traffic lights, just a median strip, a few villages, and a pedestrian crossing?

Driver: Yes, especially on certain roads. For instance, when I see someone approaching the crossing, I stop and let them pass. In such cases, the pedestrian usually acknowledges my gesture with a wave, signaling that it's safe for them to cross.

Interviewer: So, it's mainly about communication through gestures?

Driver: Exactly. Communication is key. The pedestrian will look to ensure it's safe before crossing. Once I wave them through, they feel assured. This mutual understanding is crucial. If it were an autonomous vehicle, it would need to handle such interactions. The technology should be able to recognize and respond to gestures. Some suggest using projections, but they don't work well in daylight.

Interviewer: Understood. So, how do you think we can solve this issue?

Driver: It's challenging. Autonomous driving systems need to be advanced enough to interpret human gestures. If we can develop a reliable system for this, it would solve many problems. However, implementing such technology is not straightforward.

Interviewer: Alright, that concludes our interview for today. It's almost 6:30. Please fill out this form for payment information. I'll be heading into a meeting now. Thank you.

Driver: Sure, no problem. Thank you.
