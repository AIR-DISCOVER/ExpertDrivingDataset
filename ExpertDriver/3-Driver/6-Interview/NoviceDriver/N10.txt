**Transcript:**

**Speaker 1:**
Hello, hello, can you try this?

**Speaker 2:**
Okay.

**Speaker 1:**
It just automatically removes it when you tap on it.

**Speaker 2:**
Right? Hmm, I was thinking about making a call during a meeting.

**Speaker 1:**
How can you not hear during a meeting? Turn it on. This short circuit is a bit noisy.

**Speaker 2:**
Hey, before. You got it right. Yes, I always look for professionals to handle it together.

**Speaker 1:**
Three growths, no more than 400. Yes, yes, very simple.

**Speaker 1:**
Then this is a specific panoramic downgrade video recorded earlier, and if you. When can you pull it for two days, what did I just say? I said, if there is a big warehouse, take it away. The big warehouse takes it, there is nothing on my desk, volume, I want to hide it. Can it be hidden?

**Speaker 2:**
Just don't move it.

**Speaker 1:**
I allow it.

**Speaker 1:**
Our work is very good. So, let's start today's final interview session. My name is Can Can, and I am responsible for this. We will review the panoramic video recorded by the camera on top of our vehicle, and we can explore your driving habits together. We can pause at any interesting points to discuss. Whether you feel it's necessary to stop or if I have some questions, we can pause at any time. Just call me, and I can easily pause it. Yes, if possible, I will ask you some specific questions, and you can say whatever comes to mind, don't worry. Just like chatting normally. Yes, at the beginning, I will ask about your driving habits in specific situations like turning or U-turns. After discussing your habits, we will review the video to see what actually happened during those moments. If there are differences from your usual habits, we will discuss why that might be. I will start with these questions. Yes, if there are any questions you don't want to answer, just let me know. If you feel it's sensitive or inconvenient to disclose, just tell me, and I won't press further.

**Speaker 1:**
Lastly, I want to emphasize that all the data we collect will be processed for operational purposes, and your personal privacy will not be leaked. Do you have any other questions? If not, we can start. Let's pause the video here. This is the platform where we started earlier. I will first ask you some simple questions. What types of cars have you driven before this experiment?

**Speaker 2:**
I've driven...

**Speaker 1:**
What is a microcar?
**Interviewer:** To start, I'll ask you some simple questions. What types of cars have you driven before this experiment?

**Interviewee:** I've driven a few.

**Interviewer:** What kind of small cars? Like the compact ones?

**Interviewee:** Yes, I've driven two-seaters with short wheelbases, and also three-box sedans, similar to those used for fishing trips. I've also driven hatchbacks like the Golf and Fit, and I've had some experience with SUVs, like the Subaru.

**Interviewer:** Have you driven electric cars or just gasoline ones? Or both?

**Interviewee:** I haven't driven electric cars.

**Interviewer:** Never?

**Interviewee:** Never.

**Interviewer:** Among the cars you've driven, did any have driver assistance features?

**Interviewee:** Most of them had basic features, but I didn't use them.

**Interviewer:** Oh, have you ever used any driver assistance features? Like cruise control?

**Interviewee:** I don't think so, and I don't really want to.

**Interviewer:** Have you used it?

**Interviewee:** Yes, but only for a few minutes, maybe half an hour on the highway. The feature felt quite useless.

**Interviewer:** Why?

**Interviewee:** Because it was introduced a long time ago, around the 1930s or 1940s. Even electric cars had this feature back then, but not many people used it. As soon as you activate cruise control, you might need to deactivate it within five seconds due to acceleration or deceleration.

**Interviewer:** Have you used any other features like automatic start-stop or lane-keeping assist?

**Interviewee:** No, I usually turn off the automatic start-stop feature. I prefer to keep the car in drive mode rather than neutral or park.

**Interviewer:** Do you usually drive short distances or long distances?

**Interviewee:** It's a mix. I drive in the city and also take test drives for about 50-60 kilometers. Sometimes, I drive 50 kilometers on the highway for leisure.

**Interviewer:** How do you feel about our car today? Is there anything you're not used to that affects your driving?

**Interviewee:** The steering wheel feels off. The feedback is inconsistent, especially towards the end of the turn. It becomes very light.

**Interviewer:** The steering wheel feels too light?

**Interviewee:** Yes, when I turn it fully, it becomes very light, which is unusual.

**Interviewer:** It should be heavier, right?

**Interviewee:** Yes, or at least consistent. This inconsistency makes the car feel cheap. Also, the hybrid system's throttle response should be more refined.
Speaker 1:
I feel like this car has a somewhat cheap feel to it, like it hasn't been fine-tuned in certain aspects. Secondly, with its hybrid system, when you press the accelerator, there should be a certain degree of responsiveness. I often check the settings on the dashboard. It seems like there's a transition process. For instance, when you reach 30 mph and accelerate quickly, there's a brief power lag before it stabilizes again. I guess that's when it switches modes.

Speaker 2:
Yes, it probably switches modes at that point.

Speaker 1:
Right, it might be something like that. The exact mechanism might have some fluctuations. You need to get used to it. This isn't necessarily good or bad, just different from what I'm used to. Normally, I drive cars with a good reputation, and this one feels different. The power delay gives you a sense of being pushed, especially when turning or braking. Compared to Japanese cars, it's less responsive.

Speaker 2:
Less responsive, indeed.

Speaker 1:
Yes, especially at the beginning. It makes the brakes feel a bit heavy. It's like a mechanical keyboard with a short travel distance but requires more force. You need to control it more precisely.

Speaker 2:
I understand. You need to apply more force to press it down, but once you do, it goes all the way.

Speaker 1:
Exactly. And the steering range is quite broad.

Speaker 2:
So, does this change how you operate the car? Do you feel any differences compared to your usual driving?

Speaker 1:
Not really, because I'm good at adapting and thinking on the go.

Speaker 2:
You adjust accordingly.

Speaker 1:
Yes, I adapt. There won't be significant changes from my usual driving.

Speaker 2:
Exactly. For instance, if the steering is tight, I'll start with less force and gradually increase it. If the steering wheel feels heavy, I'll use smaller adjustments or drive at a lower speed. At lower speeds, there's likely some electronic assistance, so it won't intervene as much. Therefore, I slow down when turning.

Speaker 1:
Otherwise, would the steering wheel become heavy at higher speeds?

Speaker 2:
No, it actually becomes lighter because of the electronic assistance.

Speaker 1:
So, it becomes lighter at higher speeds?

Speaker 2:
Yes, the electronic assistance kicks in. Normally, the faster you go, the more assistance you get. You need to overcome the inertia, especially when turning.

Speaker 1:
Got it. Let's take a look at our video now.
**Speaker 1:**
Alright, let's start by watching our video. I'll explain how you can navigate through it. You can also get a 360-degree view of the surroundings.

**Speaker 2:**
This is my second time doing this.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, exactly. This is the chip. Initially, there are several consecutive right turns. Could you describe your driving habits during these right turns? You can start by describing the scenario and then your actions.

**Speaker 2:**
First, I observe the surroundings, especially checking if there are any electric bikes behind me. Then, I consider the wheelbase and the overall dimensions of my vehicle.

**Speaker 1:**
Calculating.

**Speaker 2:**
When I'm driving a V-shaped vehicle, I can adopt a more aggressive approach. However, with a larger vehicle that has a longer wheelbase and is heavier, I usually reduce my speed significantly and take a wider turn to prevent the side of the vehicle from scraping the right side.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you observe other areas as well?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I mainly focus on the right rearview mirror and predict the turning radius.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you check if there are any vehicles in the lane ahead?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I check if there are any vehicles in the straight lane ahead.

**Speaker 1:**
So, what is your observation sequence?

**Speaker 2:**
I first check behind me because I'm more concerned about electric bikes.

**Speaker 1:**
You check the right rearview mirror first?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, for electric bikes, then I check the left front.

**Speaker 1:**
And the straight lane ahead?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, to see if there are any vehicles that might interfere with my turn. I don't check the left rear at all.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you skip observing the left rear?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you check the right front?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I don't. I focus more on the left front because by the time I make the turn, any vehicles in the right front should have already moved.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, can you tell me when you start observing? At what distance?

**Speaker 2:**
You can continue playing the video. I start observing around here, at the entrance, approximately 11-12 meters away. By the 20-meter mark, I should have already started observing.

**Speaker 1:**
So, around 10 meters?

**Speaker 2:**
I should start observing at around 30 meters. I adjust my observation based on the situation. If there are many fast-moving electric bikes, I start observing earlier. I mentally calculate how many electric bikes I have passed. In this scenario, since there are no electric bikes nearby, I can proceed confidently. However, if I were overtaking electric bikes, I would estimate the remaining distance more carefully.
**Speaker 1:**
When you're driving, you seem very confident. But if you were to overtake another electric vehicle here, how would you approach it? How far ahead would you start planning?

**Speaker 2:**
I would definitely start by observing the situation. I can see the electric vehicles ahead of me and predict their paths. I also check for faster vehicles coming from behind, like those going 30-40 km/h. If there aren't any, I can focus more on observing the left front and right side.

**Speaker 1:**
When do you start observing the left front?

**Speaker 2:**
I start observing when I begin to slow down, right when I press the brake.

**Speaker 1:**
When exactly do you press the brake?

**Speaker 2:**
It depends on my speed. Generally, I ease off the accelerator and lightly press the brake to reduce speed.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you just ease off the accelerator, not a full brake press?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, just easing off the accelerator.

**Speaker 1:**
When do you start observing the left side?

**Speaker 2:**
I start observing early, even before I press the brake. I make sure to check the left side as I begin to slow down.

**Speaker 1:**
What about your subsequent actions? Steering, accelerator, brake—what's your process?

**Speaker 2:**
The steering process is quite standard. When I start to turn, I am already steering. As the car begins to turn, I adjust the steering wheel accordingly. Once the car is aligned with the new direction, I straighten the wheel. The timing of these actions depends on the car's wheelbase and performance.
**Speaker 1:**
After merging onto the main road, what happens next?

**Speaker 2:**
It starts. Yes, this is related to the wheelbase of the car and its performance. For instance, if I want the car to follow a specific path, I need to adjust the steering accordingly. When you first start driving a car, you need to get a feel for it. For example, if I'm driving a compact car with a short wheelbase, I need to steer earlier. If I steer too late, I might end up on the sidewalk. This isn't about my driving habits; it's about controlling the car's path. I adapt to the car rather than making the car adapt to me.

**Speaker 1:**
So, when you steer, do you constantly adjust the wheel, or do you turn it to a certain position and hold it there?

**Speaker 2:**
Initially, I turn it to a certain position because I understand the car's behavior.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you're saying this isn't about your usual driving habits, but rather about making a single, decisive turn to complete the maneuver?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I turn it to the desired position and then gradually release it. This is something everyone, including automated systems, should aim for.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you mean that after turning the wheel, you let the car move forward on its own, or do you keep adjusting the steering during the turn?

**Speaker 2:**
Are you asking about the car's power or just the steering? The steering should be turned to the desired position gradually and linearly.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you keep adjusting the steering gradually?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, you could say that. It's a linear process. The car's acceleration is also linear; it doesn't have squared acceleration. This is typical.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you adjust the steering while turning, rather than turning the wheel first and then starting the turn?

**Speaker 2:**
The principle is that the car responds to how much you steer. It's not possible to...

**Speaker 1:**
I mean, some people steer to the desired position and then accelerate.

**Speaker 2:**
Or brake. Yes.

**Speaker 1:**
It's a bit like making a U-turn.

**Speaker 2:**
I usually prefer a smoother approach.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you avoid any jerky movements?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I aim for smooth speed and linear motion.

**Speaker 1:**
When do you start straightening the wheel?

**Speaker 2:**
I let the car's speed and resistance help straighten the wheel.

**Speaker 1:**
So, if you're making a 90-degree turn, at what point do you start straightening the wheel?

**Speaker 2:**
When the turn reaches about 60 degrees, I let the car's speed and resistance help bring the wheel back. The car's natural motion will help straighten the wheel if you don't hold it.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it will automatically straighten?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I usually rely on that force.
Speaker 1:
Will it automatically adjust if you don't intervene?

Speaker 2:
Yes, it will automatically adjust and decelerate.

Speaker 1:
Do you usually use this method to control it?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I usually use this method to limit its speed.

Speaker 1:
Do you accelerate when you need to?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I accelerate to maintain the speed. Adding throttle is to increase the speed. I aim to ensure that all aspects of the car's performance support its speed, making the speed transitions smoother.

Speaker 1:
So, you need to manage it properly. Correct?

Speaker 2:
Yes, when I feel the car is losing speed, especially during a turn, I compensate for the speed loss. This is crucial when exiting a turn.

Speaker 1:
What kind of car do you usually drive?

Speaker 2:
It depends on the car. Different cars have different tire grips and weights, so they handle differently. My goal is always to make the speed transitions as smooth as possible.

Speaker 1:
Do you usually drive the same car?

Speaker 2:
No, I have driven about five or six different cars, each with significant differences.

Speaker 1:
So, you don't have a fixed driving habit?

Speaker 2:
Correct, but I do have a habit of making the driving experience as smooth as possible. Good driving skills are about adapting to different cars and conditions.

Speaker 1:
Do you drive each car for only a short period?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I don't drive any single car for a long time, so I don't develop a strong dependency on specific driving habits. For example, if I need to accelerate, I do it smoothly to maintain a steady speed and reduce abrupt movements.

Speaker 1:
Do you pay attention to the quality of the road on the right side?

Speaker 2:
No, because they are at a safe distance. The field of view can make it seem like they are closer, but they are not. For example, if there are delivery riders on the left, I am not worried because I can judge the distance accurately.

Speaker 1:
At that moment, were you easing off the throttle or applying the brakes?

Speaker 2:
I was driving normally without any sudden changes. I always maintain a safe distance and adjust my speed accordingly. In that scenario, the biggest risk was...
**Speaker 1:**
Can you describe your usual habits when merging from a side road into a main road?

**Speaker 2:**
When merging from a side road into a main road, the main road has the right of way. The speed and flow on the side road are usually slower. Before merging, you should check the main road on your left to see if there are any oncoming vehicles. 

**Speaker 1:**
Where exactly should you be looking?

**Speaker 2:**
You should glance to your left to check the traffic. 

**Speaker 1:**
Should you check the left rear or the left front?

**Speaker 2:**
You should check the left side, both rear and front. 

**Speaker 1:**
Got it.

**Speaker 2:**
You should quickly assess the speed and density of the traffic. If the road is relatively clear and the speed of the cars is similar to yours, you might need to slow down a bit to let them pass. Then, check your rearview mirror to see if there are any cars behind you. Once it's clear, you can merge into the main road.

**Speaker 1:**
What specific actions do you take?

**Speaker 2:**
At this point, I would be checking for any cars with my peripheral vision. If I see cars approaching, I would brake slightly to let them pass. If the road is clear, I would check my rearview mirror again to ensure there are no cars behind me. Once I confirm it's safe, I would merge into the leftmost lane.

**Speaker 1:**
Could you see the white car at that time?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I could see it. I judged that it was moving very slowly, so I felt confident to merge. The BMW behind me was not an issue.

**Speaker 1:**
So, your usual habit when merging is to start observing the left side and rear before entering the transition zone?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, if the navigation indicates that I need to merge soon, I start observing the traffic conditions on the main road.

**Speaker 1:**
At that point?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I start observing before I reach the transition zone.
**Speaker 1:**
When the navigation system alerts you that you need to take an exit soon, what should you do?

**Speaker 2:**
At that moment, you should start observing your surroundings. Before reaching the bus stop, you should already be aware of the traffic conditions.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you mean you start observing before the bus stop?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. You need to make a rough judgment of the situation even if you haven't seen the exact layout yet.

**Speaker 1:**
I understand. So, you start observing and then what?

**Speaker 2:**
Around the streetlight, I would start looking at a wider angle, especially if there's a green belt. I would turn my head more to the left to check if there are any cars behind me. Then, as I move forward, I would use the host system to make a more precise judgment. I would slow down and check if I can see the exit clearly. When I see it, I would notice if there's a white car, for example. If I had seen it earlier, I would know whether it has passed or is still negotiating with me at a slow speed. Then, I would adjust my position accordingly.

**Speaker 1:**
So, do you start turning the steering wheel as soon as you enter the transition area?

**Speaker 2:**
No, it's a bit different. On the highway, I would start observing the rear traffic much earlier. The key is to make early judgments. I would consider factors like the number of cars, their speed, and the traffic flow. This helps me make better decisions compared to some other drivers who might just follow the navigation blindly.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you describe your usual speed on such roads?

**Speaker 2:**
I usually follow the speed of the car in front of me.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you match the speed of the car ahead?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, to avoid accidents and adapt to local driving conditions. For example, in some county-level cities, the speed limit might be 30 km/h, but the roads are empty. Sticking to 30 km/h might actually cause accidents because other cars might want to overtake you. It's not about breaking the rules but about reducing the risk of accidents. In places like Hainan, where the speed limit is 80 km/h but everyone drives at 60 km/h, maintaining the flow of traffic is the safest way.

**Speaker 1:**
What about the distance between your car and the one in front?

**Speaker 2:**
Maintaining a safe distance is crucial.
Speaker 1:
What kind of following distance do you prefer to maintain while driving?

Speaker 2:
I usually keep a normal distance, not too close and not too far. It's important to maintain a safe distance.

Speaker 1:
Approximately how much distance are we talking about?

Speaker 2:
It's closer than what you see in the video.

Speaker 1:
Got it. So, why do you keep a greater distance sometimes?

Speaker 2:
I keep a greater distance when I see that the right lane is moving faster. It depends on the situation.

Speaker 1:
What are your usual habits for maintaining distance?

Speaker 2:
It varies. For instance, if everyone is driving at the same speed, I feel comfortable keeping a closer distance because no one is trying to cut in. But during rush hour or when traffic is heavy, I keep a closer distance to avoid being cut off.

Speaker 1:
So, it depends on the traffic conditions?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. In heavy traffic, I keep a closer distance. In lighter traffic, I can afford to keep a longer distance. It also makes the ride more comfortable for passengers.

Speaker 1:
Around 25 meters, perhaps? Do you prefer to keep your car in the middle of the lane or towards the sides?

Speaker 2:
It depends on the situation. For example, if I need to make a U-turn, I stay in the leftmost lane.

Speaker 1:
I mean, do you prefer to stay towards the left, right, or center of the lane?

Speaker 2:
I usually stay a bit to the left.

Speaker 1:
Is that a habit?

Speaker 2:
It's more of a rational decision. Staying slightly to the left helps me avoid potential hazards. When I'm not paying much attention, I might drift to the right, but when I'm focused, I stay to the left.

Speaker 1:
Can you describe your driving habits when making a U-turn?

Speaker 2:
Sure, when making a U-turn, I always ensure I'm in the leftmost lane and check for oncoming traffic.
**Speaker 1:**
Let's start by discussing the process of making a U-turn. Can you describe your driving habits and thought process during a U-turn?

**Speaker 2:**
Sure, it's all about technology these days. You see, the second time I made a U-turn, I did it in one go. I always consider the car's turning radius and the situation around me.

**Speaker 1:**
You don't need to worry about the 90-degree turn today.

**Speaker 2:**
The fewer cars there are, the quicker I can make the turn in one go.

**Speaker 1:**
Exactly, that's your goal.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, to be as quick as possible while staying safe. The slower you are, the less safe it becomes.

**Speaker 1:**
So, how do you observe the surroundings before making a U-turn? What do you look for, and how do you operate the car during the turn? Do you use the brakes or the steering wheel?

**Speaker 2:**
First, I observe if there are any cars coming from the opposite direction. For example, if the traffic light is green on the other side, I wait until there are no cars. I wait for a clear path before making the U-turn.

**Speaker 1:**
When you say you wait for no cars, do you mean both lanes on the opposite side should be clear, or just the lane closest to you?

**Speaker 2:**
I judge based on safety. If the lane closest to me is clear but there's one fast-moving car in the other lane, I might still go ahead because by the time I turn, that car will be far away. I make a comprehensive assessment. For instance, if my lane is clear but there are three or four cars in the opposite lane, I won't turn. I consider all these factors in my mind.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you consider both lanes on the opposite side?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I consider all lanes. Even if there are four lanes, like on a roundabout in Hainan, I make sure all lanes are clear. Even if I only need to turn into the second lane, I check all four lanes to avoid any sudden surprises from other drivers.

**Speaker 1:**
Even if you can't turn into the desired lane immediately?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, even if I can only turn into the second lane, I still check all lanes.

**Speaker 1:**
Besides observing the traffic, what else do you look for?

**Speaker 2:**
I also check the traffic lights and the type of vehicles around. For example, if the right lane is turning left, I need to be aware of that. I judge how those vehicles will move based on the traffic lights.

**Speaker 1:**
So, when cars from the right are turning left, you take that into account?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly.
Speaker 1:
If the car in the right lane is turning left, I definitely need to watch them as they make the turn.

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. If their car is on the right and they are turning left, I need to be aware of their movements, especially when I'm going straight.

Speaker 1:
Where should you be observing from? The right front window or while making a U-turn?

Speaker 2:
From the right front window. At that moment, you can't rely on the rearview mirror because it won't be useful during a U-turn.

Speaker 1:
So, when making a U-turn, you don't look at any rearview mirrors?

Speaker 2:
Correct, I don't rely on them. During a U-turn, I focus on looking through the side windows.

Speaker 1:
What do you look at during a U-turn?

Speaker 2:
I turn my head significantly to get a better view. I use both the right and left side windows to see clearly.

Speaker 1:
Right, you use the side windows. But sometimes, you might not need the right window if you can see everything through the windshield.

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. In some cases, the windshield view is sufficient.

Speaker 1:
Do you turn the steering wheel all the way when making a U-turn?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I turn it all the way, then release it slightly to get a better angle, and then turn it fully again.

Speaker 1:
So, you release it a bit first?

Speaker 2:
Yes, you can watch me do it.

Speaker 1:
You turn to the right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, to the right. You can see that the front of my car is angled to the right. Even though I'm in the left lane, I gradually move to the right and then make the turn.

Speaker 1:
So, you check the distance from the car on the right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I can gauge the distance by looking at the left side and the lane markings. I know it's safe to proceed because the black car coming from the opposite direction will stop.

Speaker 1:
So, during the U-turn, you rely on the car's idle speed?

Speaker 2:
No, I don't rely on idle speed because it lacks power. I need the car to be ready to accelerate or brake at any moment. Idle speed alone won't provide the necessary control.

Speaker 1:
So, you use the gas pedal during the turn?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I keep the car ready to accelerate or brake as needed. Without using the gas pedal, the car won't have enough speed, and it might stall. I need the car to be in a state of readiness with sufficient power.

Speaker 1:
When do you increase your speed?
Speaker 1:
I need to ensure that the car's power is always in a ready and abundant state.

Speaker 2:
When do you need to increase your speed?

Speaker 1:
At what point do you feel confident to accelerate smoothly?

Speaker 2:
I look for the point where the torque is at its maximum, where the power output is the greatest.

Speaker 1:
No, I mean, for example, when you turn the steering wheel 180 degrees, at what point do you feel you can safely accelerate?

Speaker 2:
I feel confident to accelerate when I turn past 60 degrees.

Speaker 1:
So, around 60 degrees is your point?

Speaker 2:
Yes, at that point, I can accelerate smoothly through the turn. I ensure the power is consistent and avoid sudden, low-speed adjustments.

Speaker 1:
After making a U-turn, when you have a straight road ahead with no cars, how do you handle acceleration?

Speaker 2:
I find the engine's comfort zone.

Speaker 1:
What do you mean by the engine's comfort zone?

Speaker 2:
It's where the engine's RPM and power output are balanced. For example, if you accelerate from idle, the RPM might be high but the power output weak. Conversely, if the RPM is low but the torque is high, it can cause a surge. I aim for a middle ground, around 2,500 to 3,000 RPM.

Speaker 1:
So, you wait for the gear to shift before accelerating further?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I make small adjustments to keep the power consistent and suitable for my acceleration needs.

Speaker 1:
You try to maintain a steady acceleration?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I ensure the power is constant.

Speaker 1:
And your throttle input changes accordingly?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I adjust the throttle based on the car's performance and gear shifts, making real-time adjustments to keep the power output stable.
**Speaker 2:**
I constantly adjust the computer in real-time to feel the car's power. It's about making real-time adjustments. I want to ensure the car's output power is optimal because it constantly changes based on various conditions.

**Speaker 1:**
In situations with no traffic, do you increase the speed to a certain level?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, for instance, when I pass a building, I might adjust the speed to 60 or 80 km/h.

**Speaker 1:**
And once you reach the speed limit, you maintain it steadily, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I keep the speed steady and control the throttle to maintain a constant speed. During formal tests, I rarely need to change lanes to overtake.

**Speaker 1:**
Okay. Can you describe your usual lane-changing habits?

**Speaker 2:**
I only change lanes when necessary. For example, if there's a very slow car ahead, I will change lanes early to overtake it. I choose a speed significantly different from the slow car to minimize the time spent overtaking. I avoid sudden accelerations and try to complete the lane change quickly and safely.

**Speaker 1:**
Wait, when describing your overtaking habits, can you first explain how you assess the current conditions before detailing your specific driving actions?

**Speaker 2:**
Judging the conditions for overtaking is complex.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you usually observe?

**Speaker 2:**
I check if there are any cars behind me.

**Speaker 1:**
Are these cars directly behind or to the left rear?

**Speaker 2:**
To the left rear. I also check the lane I want to overtake into.

**Speaker 1:**
Is there a car in the overtaking lane?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I check if there are cars in the overtaking lane and if they are too close, which might cause a collision.

**Speaker 1:**
What about the car in front of you? Do you check if it intends to change lanes?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I check if the car in front of me is signaling a lane change. If it’s a slow-moving car, it usually won't change lanes, but I still need to be cautious.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you observe the car in front? Do you look through the windows?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, if I can see through the windows, I can tell if the car is about to change lanes. If I can't see, it means there’s no immediate danger.

**Speaker 1:**
Would you slightly shift your car to the left to get a better view?

**Speaker 2:**
No, that would be dangerous driving. Slightly shifting left could alarm the car behind me. I need to control my car and avoid overtaking if the situation is unclear. Many drivers are cautious of unpredictable actions from others.
**Speaker 1:**
So, let's talk about observation. Besides checking the left rear and the car in front, what else do you observe?

**Speaker 2:**
I also observe the condition of the car ahead, definitely.

**Speaker 1:**
If I want to overtake, what should I consider about the car in front?

**Speaker 2:**
You need to check if it's stable. If it's not, you should be cautious. 

**Speaker 1:**
Is it maintaining a constant speed or varying between fast and slow?

**Speaker 2:**
If it's maintaining a constant slow speed, I would assess it. For example, if there's a high probability that I can overtake it safely, I would proceed.

**Speaker 1:**
Are there any other observations you make?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, for instance, if the driver ahead seems impatient or aggressive, they might suddenly speed up when you try to overtake. If they don't like being overtaken, it could be dangerous.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else you observe?

**Speaker 2:**
No, that's about it. 

**Speaker 1:**
So, what’s your process when you decide to overtake?

**Speaker 2:**
I usually observe for one second to quickly assess the situation.

**Speaker 1:**
You mean observing the left rear for one second?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, focus for one second and then make a quick decision.

**Speaker 1:**
How much distance do you need to feel comfortable overtaking?

**Speaker 2:**
Based on my experience, if the car in the rearview mirror looks small, it's usually safe. Typically, around 20 meters is a good distance.

**Speaker 1:**
20 meters?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, then I would quickly change lanes. This requires a decisive and swift maneuver.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you make a sharp turn?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, a sharp turn to change lanes quickly. Then, I would accelerate rapidly, ideally completing the overtaking maneuver within 5 seconds.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you floor the gas pedal for about 2 seconds?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, floor the gas pedal to ensure a quick acceleration. For a regular car, this should be sufficient.
Speaker 1:
When you accelerate past 3, you need to floor it for about 2 seconds to reach 40.

Speaker 2:
Yes, you need to floor it. For a smart car, you need to do that, but for a regular car, it's normal. If the car in front is moving slowly, you just need to maintain a safe distance.

Speaker 1:
So, you mean you keep a distance from the car in front?

Speaker 2:
Yes, you need to find the right distance when overtaking.

Speaker 1:
When you overtake, do you pull ahead of the car in front?

Speaker 2:
Yes, about 15 meters ahead.

Speaker 1:
So, you overtake by 15 meters?

Speaker 2:
Yes, because in such situations, I prefer a shorter distance compared to 20 meters. By the time I fully overtake, the speed difference is significant, and I might be 30 meters ahead. If I've completed the acceleration, I can rationally judge the distance. Even if the speed difference is small, it's fine because my speed is higher. The distance doesn't matter much as long as it's safe.

Speaker 1:
So, there's no need for any special maneuvers?

Speaker 2:
Exactly, no special maneuvers are needed.

Speaker 1:
You can see the auxiliary view in the rearview mirror, but not from my right window.

Speaker 2:
Yes, in Beijing, it's spacious, and the non-motorized lanes are wide. This makes me feel more at ease because non-motorized vehicles have space to avoid, and they won't drive aggressively.

Speaker 1:
I'll ask you some other questions later. Is there anything else about the previous questions?

Speaker 2:
There was one thing missing.

Speaker 1:
Have you ever been in a traffic accident?

Speaker 2:
No, I've never been in any accidents, not even minor ones.

Speaker 1:
That's good to know. So, during this driving experiment, what do you particularly focus on?

Speaker 2:
I focus on increasing my attention.

Speaker 1:
How do you specifically increase your attention?

Speaker 2:
For example, I check the rearview mirror for 2-3 seconds or just a quick glance. I try to minimize the time spent looking away from the road.

Speaker 1:
So, you reduce the time spent looking away?

Speaker 2:
Yes, reducing the time spent looking away. When overtaking, you need to do it quickly. When changing lanes or turning, you need to minimize hesitation. The shorter the time, the safer it is. By concentrating, I can reduce these times and make it safer.

Speaker 1:
Got it. Thank you.
Speaker 1: So, you think that by focusing your attention and reducing reaction times, you can drive more safely. Is there anything else you do to ensure safety while driving?

Speaker 2: No, I mainly focus on comfort. Making the drive more comfortable is more challenging.

Speaker 1: I see. Based on your driving experience today, do you have any other methods to make driving safer?

Speaker 2: Yes, I believe in strict safety measures. For example, if a collision is imminent, the car should automatically brake to minimize the impact.

Speaker 1: Are you referring to the car's built-in safety features?

Speaker 2: Yes, the car itself.

Speaker 1: Like an automatic braking system?

Speaker 2: Exactly, even if a collision happens, the damage would be minimized.

Speaker 1: Understood. Can you recall any situations while driving that made you particularly anxious?

Speaker 2: Situations where I drive slowly, especially on mountain roads or rural areas where other drivers are impatient and try to overtake aggressively. They force you to make way, and if you don't, they might hit you. Even if it's their fault, they might confront you aggressively, which is very stressful, especially in unfamiliar areas.

Speaker 1: So, you are more concerned about the behavior of other drivers?

Speaker 2: Yes, especially when driving in unfamiliar places.

Speaker 1: How do you assess other drivers' behavior?

Speaker 2: I judge them based on their driving behavior. For instance, someone trying to overtake on a narrow mountain road in a beat-up car is likely not very considerate or skilled. In such cases, I try to avoid them as precisely as possible to prevent any confrontation or collision, even if it means taking extra caution.

Speaker 1: Are there any other situations that make you anxious?

Speaker 2: No, other than that, following traffic rules makes me feel safe.

Speaker 1: Do you think you have any bad driving habits that could be dangerous?

Speaker 2: Bad driving habits that could be dangerous?
**Speaker 1:**
What do you think are some of your driving habits that might lead to dangerous situations?

**Speaker 2:**
Well, one habit that might be dangerous is that I tend to follow my own set of rules. I believe I have my own values when it comes to driving.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think your set of rules is safe?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I believe they are safe and represent the future trend. As driving data improves, my approach will become more common. Some older drivers tend to drive very slowly, thinking it’s safer. But I believe that driving very slowly isn't necessarily safe. You should drive slowly where it's needed and drive faster where it's safe to do so.

**Speaker 1:**
When you're a passenger, what driving behaviors from others make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**
One behavior is driving significantly faster than the flow of traffic.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you mean speeding?

**Speaker 2:**
Not just speeding, but driving much faster than the overall flow of traffic. If everyone is driving at a certain speed, you should match that speed. For example, if the speed limit is 30 mph but everyone is driving at 50 mph, you should drive at 50 mph to stay safe. Conversely, if the speed limit is 100 mph but everyone is driving at 30 mph, you should also drive at 30 mph. Driving much faster or slower than the flow of traffic is dangerous.

**Speaker 1:**
Are there any other behaviors that make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, if a driver’s skills are clearly lacking, it makes me feel unsafe. For example, if they can't judge distances accurately or don't practice defensive driving, it’s concerning.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you judge a driver's skills?

**Speaker 2:**
By their ability to estimate distances correctly and their awareness of defensive driving. If they don't slow down when approaching a hidden pedestrian or don't maintain a safe distance from other vehicles, it shows a lack of skill and awareness.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you describe how you usually make a left turn?

**Speaker 2:**
When making a left turn, I first look at the cars coming from the right and then the cars coming from the left.

**Speaker 1:**
So you first check the cars from the right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I focus on the cars from the right first.

**Speaker 1:**
And then you check the cars from the left?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I don't usually check the side mirrors when making a left turn. It's similar to making a right turn.

**Speaker 1:**
Is making a left turn more challenging than a right turn?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, making a left turn can be more complex due to the larger turning radius and the need to cross oncoming traffic.
**Speaker 2:**
When you accelerate, it's similar to making a right turn.

**Speaker 1:**
Like making a right turn?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
Is the assistance greater when making a left turn? Or is it that the speed of the turn is greater? What do you mean?

**Speaker 2:**
It's about following the optimal driving trajectory. Each road has its own best driving path, and I just follow it closely.

**Speaker 1:**
Which do you think is more difficult, turning left or right?

**Speaker 2:**
Hmm, turning right is more challenging.

**Speaker 1:**
Because when turning right, you need to pay extra attention to the bike lane on your right, correct? You don't need to do that when turning left. Okay, when you drive, do you pay attention to the passengers in your car? What aspects do you focus on?

**Speaker 2:**
I try to maintain smooth acceleration and deceleration so that the passengers have a better experience.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you describe how you handled the situation when you encountered an oncoming vehicle while trying to overtake?

**Speaker 2:**
At that moment, I followed the lane markings and abandoned the overtaking maneuver.

**Speaker 1:**
So, when you saw the oncoming vehicle, you gave up overtaking?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I gave up overtaking and waited for the oncoming vehicle to pass before proceeding.

**Speaker 1:**
Oh, we were talking about focusing on the overall driving experience. What aspects do you pay attention to?

**Speaker 2:**
I believe there are certain standards for evaluating the driving experience, like how smooth the ride is.

**Speaker 1:**
Not just the passengers' experience, but what specific aspects do you focus on?

**Speaker 2:**
I focus on how stable the ride is, whether the turns are smooth, and if the acceleration and deceleration are linear. Meeting these standards ensures a good experience for all passengers.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you pay attention to whether the passengers feel safe and comfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, all passengers want a comfortable ride. It's about making sure they feel good.

**Speaker 1:**
So, do you focus more on the car or the passengers?

**Speaker 2:**
If there are no passengers, I might drive according to my own preferences, like driving faster or more aggressively. But with passengers, I drive in a way that makes them feel the ride is smooth and controlled.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you try to make the ride feel smooth for the passengers, like they're on a boat?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. The goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible, like sailing on a boat.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you aim to make the transitions and turns feel even and smooth?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, including the turns. The centrifugal force should feel like it's gently guiding them, just like on a boat.
Speaker 1:
It's really great.

Speaker 2:
Yes, making sure they feel the changes are smooth, like being on a boat.

Speaker 1:
Exactly.

Speaker 2:
Passengers don't have a standard for evaluation, but I think the only standard is smooth changes. Whether it's speed, angular velocity, or any kind of acceleration.

Speaker 1:
Yes, it's all about smoothness. So, do you think you have any driving habits that might make passengers uncomfortable?

Speaker 2:
I sometimes misjudge situations due to my own experience. For example, if I'm driving a new car that I'm not familiar with, I might misjudge when turning left or right, parking, or reversing. This is because I'm not used to the car yet. Other than that, if I want to make passengers feel comfortable, I usually can, because I consciously try to drive smoothly.

Speaker 1:
Besides misjudging situations, is there anything else?

Speaker 2:
Yes, sometimes it's due to traffic conditions, like during rush hour. I have to follow the car in front closely, and I can't accelerate or decelerate smoothly. I have to keep braking and accelerating because of the traffic. If I don't, other cars might cut in.

Speaker 1:
So, because of traffic, you have to keep braking and accelerating?

Speaker 2:
Yes, if other cars don't cut in, even in traffic, I can maintain a smooth flow with the overall traffic system.

Speaker 1:
Let's look at a scenario where there's a non-motorized vehicle in the middle of the road, and you have to move into the opposite lane to overtake it.

Speaker 2:
I would first check if there are any oncoming cars in the opposite lane. If it's clear, I would move to the right lane to overtake.

Speaker 1:
Do you worry about oncoming traffic when overtaking?

Speaker 2:
Yes, definitely. Especially on roads with broken yellow lines, you have to be cautious of oncoming traffic. I would also be aware of the right side to avoid any sudden entries from side roads. I try to anticipate and make effective maneuvers early to reduce unnecessary actions. If I see an opening on the right, I would be cautious, but if I can't see clearly, that's a risk point.

Speaker 1:
So, you are more concerned about what you can't see on the right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly.
**Speaker 1:**
Are there any risk points? No. The right side, I can't see it clearly. That's the style. It's the car on the right side. I'm afraid there are many things inside.

**Speaker 2:**
It's this car, right.

**Speaker 1:**
This car blocks my view, so I would be very cautious.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I would drive cautiously. Would you be afraid in this situation? No, because I can see it and judge its trajectory. For example, if I think the space is wide enough, I don't need to worry.

**Speaker 1:**
Are there any other points that might make passengers uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
No, usually they are on their phones or looking at the scenery. They don't care about the dangers around. Especially if they trust the driver, like when I take a Didi (ride-hailing service). If the driver has driven many kilometers, I subconsciously trust them. Even if they drive close to the side, I don't feel scared. But if it's an experienced driver, even if they cut in, I wouldn't feel uncomfortable. It's a preconceived notion.

**Speaker 1:**
So, when you are a passenger, what behaviors from other drivers make you uncomfortable? Or does it not depend on their behavior? If they have enough driving experience, do you feel comfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, if they drive steadily.

**Speaker 1:**
Back to the previous question, what driving behaviors make you uncomfortable when you are a passenger?

**Speaker 2:**
If an experienced driver drives slowly but steadily, it's fine. But if they accelerate and decelerate quickly, take sharp turns, or make sudden speed changes, it makes me uncomfortable. Also, if a new driver drives very slowly and hesitates, or makes many improper actions, it makes me uncomfortable. For example, if they slow down at the wrong time or seem confused, it makes me uneasy because I value safe driving.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
No, that's it.

**Speaker 1:**
Would you accept a driver whose driving style is very different from yours?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I would accept it.

**Speaker 1:**
Even if they are a bit aggressive?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I wouldn't mind.

**Speaker 1:**
Have you had such experiences often?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I often take rides, and some drivers are very aggressive.
**Speaker 1:**
Have you ever had such disputes?

**Speaker 2:**
Quite a few. Yes, I also drive every day, and I am very cautious. I believe that no one would think highly of someone who drives recklessly. For example, a special edition car that accelerates very efficiently and has special features.

**Speaker 1:**
So, if someone drives very conservatively, it wouldn't feel uncomfortable either?

**Speaker 2:**
It wouldn't feel uncomfortable because my driving style is already relatively conservative. Compared to me, there are even more conservative drivers. A complete novice driver might be irregular, non-standard, and incorrect. My conservative driving style is not incorrect; it doesn't mean it's better or worse. I believe that when I drive seriously, my driving is very standard and correct. What do you mean by slower or something?

**Speaker 1:**
Considering the comfort of passengers today, what aspects do you pay special attention to?

**Speaker 2:**
I make a point to decelerate early to provide a steady slowdown. For instance, when there are passengers, I accelerate more gently.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you decelerate by releasing the accelerator and letting the car coast?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I actively apply the brakes early to guide the deceleration, but with less force to make it smoother.

**Speaker 1:**
Is there anything else you pay attention to?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I just try to avoid making passengers uncomfortable. I focus on areas where they might feel uneasy and try to avoid those situations.

**Speaker 1:**
Based on today's driving experience, do you think there's any way to make passengers feel even more comfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
By converting the experience of seasoned drivers into code. For example, using preventive measures and effective operations.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you mean by effective and ineffective operations? How do you judge them?

**Speaker 2:**
Effective operations follow a process. Experienced drivers have summarized many techniques. For instance, if there's an intersection ahead and no cars on the left, you should anticipate pedestrians suddenly appearing from the right and steer slightly to the left. This is an effective operation. It's not about slamming the brakes to check for pedestrians and then deciding whether to steer left or right. A simple, almost imperceptible action for the passenger is more effective than multiple abrupt maneuvers to achieve the same goal. It's like playing a game where you aim for effective actions per minute (EPM). In driving, it's about making smooth, effective maneuvers rather than erratic ones.
Speaker 1: So, besides what you mentioned about experienced driving, is there anything else that can make passengers feel more comfortable?

Speaker 2: Yes, it's about planning the route in advance.

Speaker 1: Planning the route in advance, that's good.

Speaker 2: Yes, you need to visualize the path and judge the best route at the moment. For example, if there are no cars ahead and there's an entrance on the side, I would slightly move to the left. Of course, others might have different strategies based on their experience.

Speaker 1: How do you determine which approach is the best?

Speaker 2: It's all about using your brain to think. In such situations, my judgment is that if there's a vehicle on the right moving at less than 40 km/h, I have enough reaction time to avoid it. Even if it's moving slowly or changing lanes, I can still maneuver through. These are my judgments based on my experience and imagination at the time. There's no fixed rulebook for this. For instance, if I see someone looking to the left, I might think they are going to turn left.

Speaker 1: So, you judge the intention of non-motorized vehicles based on the direction the rider is looking?

Speaker 2: Yes, including their trajectory. Not all the time, but often.

Speaker 1: You pay attention to where the rider's face is pointing?

Speaker 2: Yes, not just that. It's the same for all vehicles. You need to avoid giving others the wrong impression. That's why I don't make unnecessary movements while driving. For example, if I slightly move to the left, it might confuse others. They might think, "Is he turning left?" when I'm not.

Speaker 1: So, you think he might be turning left because he's looking that way?

Speaker 2: Yes, but he might just be going straight. You can't always predict his actions. He might not have a clear understanding of driving dynamics. Even cyclists should be aware of this, just like drivers.
**Speaker 1:**
What was the reason? As a cyclist, he might not have the same experience as a driver. For instance, if he wants to make a left turn, he should signal his intention early, just like a car would. Instead of hesitating and moving right while looking left, he should make a decisive turn. He needs to overcome his fears and make clear decisions. I think he might not be a driver or doesn't understand the dynamics of driving. Drivers will notice and give way if you signal your intention to turn left. He might be unsure or inexperienced in driving.

**Speaker 2:**
The intersection ahead doesn't have traffic lights. Can you describe how you observed and judged the situation with the vehicles?

**Speaker 1:**
Without traffic lights, I observe everything around me.

**Speaker 2:**
Is there a specific order you follow?

**Speaker 1:**
There's no strict order, but I prioritize areas with more traffic.

**Speaker 2:**
So, you focus on the busiest areas first?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 2:**
Even if you're turning right, you don't just look to the right. You have to be aware of everything around you.

**Speaker 1:**
Absolutely. For example, if there's a vehicle on the right that might turn into my lane, I need to be cautious. Defensive driving is crucial. I stay aware of potential hazards from all directions.

**Speaker 2:**
Do you have any other tips to make passengers feel more comfortable?

**Speaker 1:**
It's important to drive smoothly and avoid sudden movements. Keeping a steady pace helps passengers feel at ease.

**Speaker 2:**
Alright. The next few questions might be a bit challenging. Take your time to think before answering. What do you think makes a good driver? Or what defines professionalism in driving?

**Speaker 1:**
A good driver follows all the rules and regulations. It's not just about driving; it's about being responsible and attentive. Even small actions, like checking mirrors and signaling, are important. Consistency and awareness are key to being a professional driver.
Speaker 1:
As long as you instruct it to drive carefully, it can do it. But usually, because of driving, it doesn't work that way. It's like when you go to pour a bottle of water, you don't need to be extremely focused. I believe most drivers know the techniques I mentioned, but they usually don't follow them. So, if you tell them to drive properly, I believe most of them will follow the rules, considering other drivers and passengers. All these actions require thinking, which is exhausting. Most drivers on the road don't want to exert that much mental effort.

Speaker 2:
So, you think most drivers have the ability to be good drivers?

Speaker 1:
Yes, they just don't want to put in the effort. They find being a good or professional driver too tiring. But they know what is good and they can do it.

Speaker 2:
You mentioned you are conducting an experiment.

Speaker 1:
Yes, but I don't think they are good data.

Speaker 2:
Not necessarily. I just want to determine if they are professional drivers. Is their job driving?

Speaker 1:
A professional driver is someone whose job involves driving. If their position requires driving, then they are a professional driver.

Speaker 2:
A good driver, in my opinion, is someone who currently drives with consideration for other vehicles and costs.

Speaker 1:
Being a good driver is about attitude. The question is whether they are willing to think proactively. A professional driver is someone who is dedicated to their driving role. Do you think full-time drivers are professional drivers?

Speaker 2:
Yes, they are professional drivers, but not necessarily good drivers.

Speaker 1:
Do you think they are professional?

Speaker 2:
Of course, they are professional.

Speaker 1:
Got it. So, what do you think is the biggest difference between experienced and new drivers?

Speaker 2:
It's mainly about judgment and experience. For example, experienced drivers can anticipate potential situations and dangers, while new drivers cannot.

Speaker 1:
New drivers don't know what might happen or where the dangers are.

Speaker 2:
Yes, they lack defensive driving skills.

Speaker 1:
They are not as accurate in assessing potential dangers.

Speaker 2:
Exactly.

Speaker 1:
Is there any other difference?

Speaker 2:
No, the main difference is in their ability to assess potential dangers.

Speaker 1:
So, the first issue is attitude towards driving.

Speaker 2:
Yes, whether they want to drive well is an attitude issue.

Speaker 1:
If you tell a new driver to drive well...
**Speaker 1:**
Let's start with the first question about attitude.

**Speaker 2:**
Sure, if you're talking to a new driver, you need to emphasize the importance of having a good attitude towards driving. If you explain the key points and they take it seriously, they can improve quickly. But if a new driver doesn't have the right attitude, they won't understand or improve their driving skills.

**Speaker 1:**
Are there any other differences?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really. When it comes to driving for someone important, like a company executive, it's more about the perception. If two drivers have similar skills, the one who is paid more will likely put in more effort to drive smoothly and comfortably. For example, if you pay a driver $20, they might not care much about impressing you. But if you pay them $500, they'll ensure a very comfortable ride, paying attention to acceleration, braking, and turning smoothly.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you think the difference is more about attitude than skill?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. Even among ride-hailing drivers, there are those with excellent driving skills. If you pay them well, the difference in their performance becomes negligible. Drivers for high-profile clients often undergo etiquette training, but there's no strict standard for driving skills. It's mostly based on experience.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, the next question might be a bit challenging. What do you think autonomous cars will never be able to do?

**Speaker 2:**
You mean like driving exactly like a human? I believe they will eventually be able to do that.

**Speaker 1:**
You think in the future, autonomous cars will drive just like humans, with no differences?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because the technology is advancing rapidly. The key is in the judgment and decision-making processes, which can be programmed and improved over time.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you give a specific example?

**Speaker 2:**
For instance, the ability to judge speed and predict the actions of other vehicles. Humans do this naturally, but with advanced sensors and algorithms, autonomous cars can simulate this process and potentially do it even better.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you think they will be more precise in the future?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, especially with the speed of oncoming traffic and other factors. Sensors can detect and react more accurately than human perception.

**Speaker 1:**
What about blind spots and potential hazards?

**Speaker 2:**
Autonomous cars can be programmed to recognize and react to blind spots and potential dangers, learning from various scenarios to handle them effectively.

**Speaker 1:**
Is there any other reason you believe they can match human driving?

**Speaker 2:**
Another factor is the consistency in behavior and decision-making, which can be very challenging but achievable with the right technology.
Speaker 1:
Are there any other reasons? Do you think it can perform like a human?

Speaker 2:
Another challenging aspect is the value of its behavior. Every licensed driver has their own way of driving. Do you understand? Humans have unique skills, like abstract thinking, making connections, and interpreting information. When it comes to value, we can all zone out and focus on what's important.

Speaker 1:
I have two more questions, which are somewhat related. The first question is: How do you judge the intentions of pedestrians, non-motorized vehicles, and motor vehicles while driving? Let's start with pedestrians.

Speaker 2:
Do they lean forward? Do they look around?

Speaker 1:
By leaning forward, you mean their body posture?

Speaker 2:
Yes, if they lean forward, it means they want to move.

Speaker 1:
So, you think if they lean forward, they intend to walk.

Speaker 2:
Yes, they are ready to move forward. They look around and assess the situation.

Speaker 1:
So, you first observe their body posture?

Speaker 2:
Yes, their posture and whether they look relaxed or tense. For example, if someone is standing relaxed, I wouldn't worry. But if they are tense and alert, I know they are paying close attention and might move.

Speaker 1:
So, posture is important to you?

Speaker 2:
Yes, it's very important. It shows if they are nervous or not.

Speaker 1:
What about their eyes? You mentioned that earlier.

Speaker 2:
Yes, if they look at me or the car, they are observing.

Speaker 1:
The direction of their gaze?

Speaker 2:
Yes, even if they glance at me from a lower angle, I can tell they are assessing the situation and their surroundings.

Speaker 1:
What are they observing?

Speaker 2:
They might be observing the speed and the environment. If they are paying attention, they might want to cross.

Speaker 1:
So, if you see them observing, you think they want to cross the road?

Speaker 2:
Yes, if they don't notice me, it could be dangerous. If they don't see me, I must be cautious and let them pass. It depends on their body language.

Speaker 1:
Besides posture and gaze, is there anything else you consider when judging a pedestrian's intention?

Speaker 2:
No, those are the main factors. You need to understand that pedestrians have various reasons for their actions, and you must prioritize their safety.
Speaker 2:
You have to understand that pedestrians can have various reasons for their actions, including elderly people who might not be familiar with cars. Even if someone has a mental illness, you need to consider their body language and any potential movements. If you notice any signs, you need to be cautious.

Speaker 1:
What about non-motorized vehicles? You mentioned a cyclist earlier. Does it matter which way their face is turned?

Speaker 2:
Yes, it does. You need to observe their body language and any subtle movements to predict their actions.

Speaker 1:
How do you judge these non-motorized vehicles?

Speaker 2:
By looking at their facial direction and body posture. You can often predict their actions through small movements.

Speaker 1:
Can you give a specific example?

Speaker 2:
For instance, if a cyclist is looking in one direction and then suddenly stops, they might be preparing to turn. If their hand is shaking or they make a slight movement, it could indicate they are about to turn left.

Speaker 1:
Are there other factors to consider with these vehicles?

Speaker 2:
Yes, you need to consider their clothing and overall behavior. For example, if it's an elderly person wearing a large hat, you might need to be extra cautious as their cognitive abilities might be lower. On the other hand, if it's a young professional who looks like they follow traffic rules, you might assume they will stop as expected.

Speaker 1:
So, you judge based on their appearance and behavior?

Speaker 2:
Exactly. You need to make a comprehensive judgment based on their speed, trajectory, and appearance. For instance, an elderly person with a large hat might require more caution, while a young professional might be more predictable. It's all about assessing the situation and making the best judgment.
Speaker 1: What about those situations with confused elderly people? They can be the hardest to predict. Their behavior can be erratic, and you really have to assess their overall condition to gauge their risk level and potential actions. Autonomous vehicles also need to evaluate these individuals based on their appearance to predict possible scenarios and respond accordingly.

Speaker 2: Yes, exactly. For motor vehicles, you can judge based on their previous driving patterns.

Speaker 1: Can you determine if a driver is good or not?

Speaker 2: You can see if they like to overtake or accelerate aggressively.

Speaker 1: How do you judge the intentions of an autonomous car?

Speaker 2: By its turn signals and adherence to traffic rules.

Speaker 1: Besides turn signals and brake lights, are there other indicators?

Speaker 2: I don't rely on other indicators. I just follow traffic rules.

Speaker 1: So, you don't judge the vehicle's intentions?

Speaker 2: No, I just stick to the traffic rules.

Speaker 1: What if the vehicle behaves unpredictably?

Speaker 2: It doesn't matter. If it tries to change lanes suddenly, I don't need to overthink it. If it causes an accident, it's their responsibility because they made the reckless move.

Speaker 1: Isn't that against defensive driving principles?

Speaker 2: Defensive driving is more about avoiding pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles.

Speaker 1: So, you don't need to be defensive against other motor vehicles?

Speaker 2: Not really, except for large trucks. You need to be cautious around them.

Speaker 1: How do you judge the behavior of large trucks?

Speaker 2: It's similar to dealing with unpredictable drivers. Truck drivers might be tired or impatient. Watch their driving patterns. If a truck is speeding up and slowing down erratically, keep your distance. Don't try to overtake them. They might suddenly change lanes and cause an accident. You need to assess their behavior and mental state to predict their actions.

Speaker 1: Okay, one last question. In a scenario without traffic signals, where pedestrians are crossing, how do you handle it?

Speaker 2: You need to evaluate the pedestrians. If you see someone who looks like they might jaywalk, you have to be extra cautious. Quick judgment based on their behavior is crucial. For example, if you see someone who looks like they might ignore the rules, you need to be prepared to stop or slow down.
Speaker 1:
Dealing with unreasonable pedestrians, like an elderly woman who insists on crossing against the red light, requires quick and effective judgment. In such situations, I have to rely on boundary-based decisions. For example, taxi drivers are often difficult to deal with because they have insurance. If you hit them, they can claim compensation for lost work through their insurance. They might even drive in a way that encourages collisions because they know they are covered. This kind of thinking requires you to use your brain and combine it with real-life experiences. Why are taxi drivers in Suzhou so aggressive? Because they know they can get compensation through insurance. They are more willing to let their cars get into accidents because the insurance company will cover their lost work fees. Why should you yield to a large truck driver? Because their insurance will also cover any damages. Why do some people who are not familiar with driving rules act irrationally? They have never driven, taken a test, or understood traffic regulations, so they don't know how the system works.

Speaker 1:
Hmm, if there's nothing else to add, we should be done here. Alright, Han Qingyan, is that correct? That's what it shows.

Speaker 2:
I think it's very challenging to use this kind of logic for autonomous driving. If I mentioned judging the attributes of a unit and predicting its behavior, it would be difficult to apply.

Speaker 1:
What do you mean by "bad case"? It seems like I don't quite understand. How is the situation?
