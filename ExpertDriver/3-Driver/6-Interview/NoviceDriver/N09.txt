**Transcript:**

**Speaker 1:**
This is the document I wanted to show you. Yes, you can speak now. Let's test the microphone.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you say a complete sentence?

**Speaker 2:**
It's a bit off.

**Speaker 1:**
Okay, this should be better. Yes, and then look at this image.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes.

**Speaker 1:**
It's not entirely dependent on it. Can you see it? No, not like that. Yes, just look at this part. Yes, that's fine.

**Speaker 1:**
Let me introduce myself first. My name is Chang Xiang, and I will be responsible for the final part of today's interview. We will watch a video recorded by the eye-tracking device during the experiment. The video will show your focus points and eye movement trajectory. We can explore your driving habits together, and we can pause and discuss any interesting points. If I find any issues, I will also pause and discuss them with you. I will ask you some questions, and you can answer them freely. Just relax and treat it like a casual conversation. I might ask you to report more details about your usual driving habits.

**Speaker 1:**
For example, how do you observe your surroundings? What is the sequence, and what do you look at? How do you operate the steering wheel, brakes, accelerator, etc.? If any questions make you uncomfortable, you can let me know, and we can skip them. Lastly, I want to emphasize that all the data we use will be anonymized and will not disclose your personal information. Now, I will play the video from the moment the car leaves the parking lot.

**Speaker 1:**
I will start with some simple questions. The red circle represents your eye focus, and the light red lines show your eye movement trajectory. Can you hear the audio? Great. First, what types of cars have you driven before this experiment? For example, SUVs, sedans, sports cars, etc., and whether they were gasoline or electric cars.

**Speaker 2:**
I have only driven gasoline cars, including SUVs and small sedans. Mostly, it was a Polo. I'm not sure if that counts.

**Speaker 1:**
I see. Have you driven cars with assisted driving features?
**Speaker 1:**
Have you driven different types of cars, like gasoline cars, SUVs, and sedans?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, mostly sedans like the Polo. I'm not sure if that counts.

**Speaker 1:**
I see. Have you ever used cars with driver assistance features?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I've never used driver assistance features.

**Speaker 1:**
Not even cruise control?

**Speaker 2:**
I use it occasionally, but I don't rely on it. I prefer to manually control the car myself.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you use it sometimes, especially on highways?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, on long highway trips.

**Speaker 1:**
Have you used any other features besides cruise control?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I haven't used automatic start-stop or automatic parking features either.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, I understand. Do you find cruise control useful?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it's useful, especially on long highway drives with fewer cars. It allows me to maintain a constant speed without having to manually control the pedals. But in other situations, I prefer to control the car myself.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it. Does your cruise control system include lane-keeping or adaptive distance features?

**Speaker 2:**
No, it only maintains a set speed.

**Speaker 1:**
Okay. Do you usually drive more in the city or on long trips?

**Speaker 2:**
In the city, I don't really have long trips. What do you mean by long trips?

**Speaker 1:**
Can you give me an average distance and time for your drives?

**Speaker 2:**
Usually within 10 kilometers, taking about half an hour.

**Speaker 1:**
That sounds like short trips. For longer trips, like over an hour or several dozen kilometers, that would be different. How did you find driving our vehicle today? Was it easy to drive? Were there any aspects you found difficult or that affected your driving?

**Speaker 2:**
It was easy to drive, but there were some differences. Each car's accelerator and brake feel different, not just in height but in overall feel. It's hard to describe, but the response and travel distance of the pedals vary. However, I adapted quickly, so it was fine.

**Speaker 1:**
So, no major differences from your usual driving experience?

**Speaker 2:**
No major differences.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, I have a potentially sensitive question. Have you ever been in a traffic accident?

**Speaker 2:**
No, never.

**Speaker 1:**
Great. Now, let's take a look at the driving video. This video will show scenarios like turning, U-turns, entering side roads, or main roads, etc.
Speaker 1:
Alright, let's take a look at the driving video. In this video, I'll pause before situations like turning, making a U-turn, entering a side road, or merging onto a main road. I'll ask you about your usual driving habits in these scenarios. After you describe them, we'll watch the video to see if it matches your description. If it doesn't, we'll discuss why you made a different decision today. Is that okay?

Speaker 2:
Yes, that's fine.

Speaker 1:
Let's start the video. I'll pause it here. Since we're dealing with a series of right turns, could you describe your driving habits when making a right turn?

Speaker 2:
Sure, for example, if I'm about to make a right turn, I first check the left side of the road to see if any vehicles, bicycles, or pedestrians are coming.

Speaker 1:
Let's slow down a bit. Can you describe exactly where you start observing and what you look for?

Speaker 2:
Before I start turning, I slow down and check the left side for any oncoming traffic, including motor vehicles, bicycles, or pedestrians.

Speaker 1:
At what point do you start slowing down? Is it before or after the stop line?

Speaker 2:
It's before the stop line.

Speaker 1:
So you slow down before the stop line and then observe the left side. If there's traffic, you stop or slow down significantly.

Speaker 2:
Yes, if there's no traffic, I continue with the turn.

Speaker 1:
I have a few questions. First, to what extent do you slow down before you start observing? Do you slow down and observe simultaneously?

Speaker 2:
It depends on the traffic conditions. If I expect the road to be clear, I do both simultaneously. During rush hour, I slow down to walking speed.

Speaker 1:
So you slow down to walking speed depending on the traffic conditions.

Speaker 2:
Yes, all of this happens before the stop line.

Speaker 1:
Do you only observe the left and left-front areas, or do you check anything else?

Speaker 2:
I mainly focus on the left because it's easy to see the right side. There won't be any vehicles coming from the right.

Speaker 1:
What if there are pedestrians or bicycles on the right side, visible only through the right front or side mirrors? Do you check those as well?

Speaker 2:
Yes, because the right side is easier to see. If there's anything there, I'll definitely notice it.

Speaker 1:
Why do you find it easier to see the right side, even though it's farther away?

Speaker 2:
Before I start observing the left side, my natural line of sight is on the right. If there's nothing on the right, I proceed with the actions I mentioned earlier. If there is something, I adjust accordingly.

Speaker 1:
When do you start checking the right front area?
Speaker 1:
When do you start looking to the right front? For example, do you start looking to the right front at this moment?

Speaker 2:
Yes, because when driving normally, you should always be aware of your surroundings.

Speaker 1:
So, you mean you are looking to the right front now?

Speaker 2:
Yes, and if I see a non-motorized vehicle, I will stop before the stop line and observe the situation of the vehicles on the left. If there are no cars, I will continue to turn left.

Speaker 1:
So, during your left turn, you don't check the right rearview mirror again?

Speaker 2:
Correct. Every time I make a right turn, I follow this routine.

Speaker 1:
I noticed that you were glancing back and forth between the left and right. This frequent checking, do you know which side you focus on more?

Speaker 2:
For example, just now I glanced to the left, then to the right. This isn't really considered frequent checking.

Speaker 1:
So, at this stage, you were glancing back and forth. Normally, you keep your attention on the right front, but now your focus is on the left.

Speaker 2:
Yes, right, then left, then right again.

Speaker 1:
I understand. So, when you make a right turn, you anticipate the situation by looking at the right front, reducing the need to check the right rearview mirror during the turn. You still glance back and forth, but mainly focus on the incoming traffic from the left. Understood. Now, I need to ask you some detailed questions about your maneuvers. First, let's talk about turning the steering wheel. When do you start turning the wheel? You mentioned earlier that you slow down and observe. Do you start turning the wheel while slowing down, or do you wait until you confirm there are no cars?

Speaker 2:
There are two scenarios. If I expect there to be few cars, I observe and turn simultaneously. If I expect more traffic, I slow down significantly or stop, then turn once it's clear.

Speaker 1:
So, today, did you expect there to be cars or not?

Speaker 2:
It was somewhere in between.

Speaker 1:
Somewhere in between, because you didn't seem too concerned.

Speaker 2:
Yes, but there were no issues.

Speaker 1:
We can see your turning process here. You started turning already, right? Your hand is pushing up on the wheel.

Speaker 2:
Yes, and then the vehicle passes through.
**Speaker 1:** Let's talk about your experience with turning the steering wheel. At this point, you’ve already started turning, right? Your hand is pushing up, and then the car moves past the stop line or onto the crosswalk, and you begin to turn, correct?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, that's right.

**Speaker 1:** When you turn, do you keep the wheel steady once you’ve started, or do you adjust the direction as you go?

**Speaker 2:** I adjust the direction as I go.

**Speaker 1:** Do you keep adjusting the direction continuously, or do you make adjustments and then hold the wheel steady?

**Speaker 2:** I adjust continuously.

**Speaker 1:** When do you start straightening the wheel after a turn?

**Speaker 2:** I start straightening it when there are about 20-30 degrees left to go.

**Speaker 1:** Because straightening the wheel takes some time, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I might start even earlier than that.

**Speaker 1:** It depends on the specific intersection and road conditions, right? You mentioned that you adjust the wheel dynamically during the turn, depending on your position.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, sometimes I might be adjusting to the left rather than straightening the wheel.

**Speaker 1:** So, you might feel that you can make the turn and then gradually straighten the wheel.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I try to follow the best path for my car.

**Speaker 1:** Got it. Now, about braking, you mentioned you start braking before reaching the intersection?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, if there are many cars, I come to a complete stop. If there are fewer cars, I slow down to a walking speed.

**Speaker 1:** When do you start releasing the brake?

**Speaker 2:** When I’m halfway through the turn.

**Speaker 1:** Do you release the brake gradually or all at once?

**Speaker 2:** Gradually.

**Speaker 1:** After releasing the brake, do you accelerate?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, but only in the later stages of the turn, depending on the road conditions.

**Speaker 1:** So, when you’re sure there are no cars and you start turning, you gradually release the brake. Then, as you near the end of the turn and start straightening the wheel, you begin to accelerate.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, that’s correct.

**Speaker 1:** Now, let’s talk about merging from a side road onto a main road. Can you describe your usual process for this?

**Speaker 2:** I usually turn my head to check behind me, directly looking back.

**Speaker 1:** You turn your head to check behind, rather than relying on the left rearview mirror?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because that area is a blind spot, and I can’t see it clearly in the mirror.
Speaker 1:
When merging onto the main road, do you turn your head to check the blind spot instead of relying on the left rearview mirror?

Speaker 2:
Yes, because that area is a blind spot, and we can't see it clearly in the mirror. So, I always turn my head to check the left rear side. If there's a car, I slow down significantly, almost to walking speed, or even stop and wait until there's no car. If I turn my head and see a long stretch without any cars, I reduce my speed slightly and then merge. Once I start merging, I rely on my judgment and the traffic situation.

Speaker 1:
So, you only start using the rearview mirror once your car's front has begun to merge onto the main road, right? Before that, you turn your head to check the left rear side. Got it. When you merge onto the main road, do you turn the steering wheel sharply to enter quickly, or do you merge slowly over a longer distance? And when do you start braking? Is it before or after entering the transition area?

Speaker 2:
I usually start braking before entering the transition area, where there's an opening.

Speaker 1:
Once you've merged onto the main road, how do you accelerate? Do you accelerate more aggressively than usual to match the speed of the traffic? How much do you press the accelerator?

Speaker 2:
I press the accelerator similarly to how I would at a traffic light.

Speaker 1:
So, you press the accelerator the same way you would when starting at a traffic light, gradually increasing the pressure?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I gradually increase the pressure.

Speaker 1:
And you don't check the right rear side at all, right? You only turn your head to check the left rear side. Is that correct?

Speaker 2:
Yes, because the entrance is not very visible due to the bushes extending into the road, which makes it difficult to see. So, I rely more on the left rearview mirror than I initially thought. I mainly use the left rearview mirror to observe. Once I reach the end of the entrance, I can see the main road clearly and decide to merge.

Speaker 1:
It seems like you rely more on the left rearview mirror than you thought. You mainly use it to observe the traffic situation. Once you reach the end of the entrance, you can see the main road clearly and decide to merge. This might be different from your usual habit.

Speaker 1:
Alright, now let's talk about driving on a straight road with good conditions. Can you describe how you usually drive on such a road?
Speaker 1:
Alright, this is a segment where the road conditions are relatively good, and you are driving in a straight line. Can you describe your usual driving habits in such scenarios?

Speaker 2:
I usually maintain the same speed as the cars next to me.

Speaker 1:
Approximately how fast is that? You can differentiate based on different types of roads.

Speaker 2:
It generally depends on the speed of the surrounding traffic.

Speaker 1:
So you base your speed on the surrounding cars rather than having a set standard for yourself?

Speaker 2:
My standard is not to exceed the speed limit. Experience shows that the speed of the surrounding traffic is always below the speed limit. Yes, my standard is not to exceed the speed limit.

Speaker 1:
Okay, and what kind of distance do you usually keep from the car in front of you? How many meters? You can also discuss this based on different speeds.

Speaker 2:
About 50 meters when the traffic is light. As the traffic increases, the speed decreases, and the distance I keep also decreases.

Speaker 1:
So, in heavy traffic, the distance can become very short, almost negligible if it's a traffic jam.

Speaker 2:
Yes, that's generally the case.

Speaker 1:
In the current road conditions, with moderate traffic, what distance do you maintain?

Speaker 2:
Around 40 meters, at least at this time.

Speaker 1:
When driving in a straight line, do you position your car in the middle of the lane, or do you tend to stay more to the left or right?

Speaker 2:
I aim to stay in the middle, but I might lean slightly to the left because I can better gauge my position relative to the left boundary.

Speaker 1:
Is that because of the left-hand drive, which affects your field of vision, making you tend to stay more to the left even though you aim for the middle?

Speaker 2:
Yes, that's correct.

Speaker 1:
Understood. It does seem like you stay slightly to the left. Now, let's talk about making a U-turn. Can you describe your habits when making a U-turn?

Speaker 2:
I usually ensure there are no oncoming cars. Either I wait until I can't see any cars in my field of vision or until the oncoming traffic has a red light. When making the U-turn, I make sure it's safe and don't need to make sudden observations because there won't be any unexpected vehicles or pedestrians.

Speaker 1:
Before making a U-turn, do you ensure that both lanes of oncoming traffic are clear, or just the lane closest to you?

Speaker 2:
I ensure both lanes are clear.

Speaker 1:
So, you make sure both lanes are clear before making a wide left turn U-turn, without needing to check for non-motorized vehicles and pedestrians?

Speaker 2:
Yes, at least on this road.

Speaker 1:
Because...
Speaker 1: Okay, so you mean when making a sharp U-turn to the left, you don't need to observe non-motorized vehicles and pedestrians?

Speaker 2: Yes, at least on this road.

Speaker 1: Because there are no crosswalks. Right, it's not a situation where you need to make a U-turn at an intersection. But if there were crosswalks, you would need to observe pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles, right?

Speaker 2: In those cases, the U-turn spot is usually a bit ahead of the main gate. Generally, there won't be any obstructions, but I always keep my eyes on the front of the car. If I see something ahead, I will definitely take action.

Speaker 1: Got it. So your main focus is on the oncoming traffic in the opposite lane. Once you confirm there are no oncoming cars, do you stop observing, or do you keep watching? Where do you focus your attention at that point?

Speaker 2: I stop observing the sides and rear because I've already ensured there are no cars.

Speaker 1: So at that point, you observe...

Speaker 2: The front.

Speaker 1: The distance between the front of the car and the curb.

Speaker 2: Yes, especially if the space is narrow.

Speaker 1: So you pay more attention to that rather than whether there are oncoming cars. Before making a U-turn, do you usually brake or come to a complete stop? 

Speaker 2: I come to a complete stop before starting the turn.

Speaker 1: So you come to a complete stop, then turn the steering wheel fully before moving again, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, if the road is narrow. If it's wide, it's not as critical.

Speaker 1: So just to confirm, you come to a complete stop, turn the wheel fully, and then start moving. Do you use the accelerator or just let the car roll?

Speaker 2: I don't use the brake much at that point.

Speaker 1: Okay, at what point during the U-turn do you start accelerating? For example, when you've turned about 180 degrees, at what point do you start accelerating?

Speaker 2: When there are about 30 degrees left to straighten the wheel.

Speaker 1: So around that point.

Speaker 2: Yes, but it also depends on the road. If the road is narrow, I will turn and accelerate later to ensure I have enough space.

Speaker 1: So before making a U-turn, do you deliberately move the car to the right to get a larger turning radius? Did you do that today?

Speaker 2: Yes, I did that today because the road was narrow.

Speaker 1: I noticed you were also checking the right side mirror while doing that.

Speaker 2: Yes, I was checking the distance between the tires and the curb.

Speaker 1: Right, to ensure the tires are close to the curb.
Speaker 2:
At the beginning, I was moving to the right.

Speaker 1:
You were watching the edge of the tire, right? The distance between the tire and the edge.

Speaker 1:
When you start moving, you should be looking at the distance between the road shoulder and the front of the car. At this point, I start pressing the accelerator, maybe while still checking ahead.

Speaker 1:
This is when you start accelerating.

Speaker 2:
And then straighten the wheel.

Speaker 1:
Yes, because when you release the turn signal, you hear that click sound, and then you start to accelerate. After completing the turn, you need to accelerate in a straight line because your turning speed is very slow, and you need to quickly reach a cruising speed. Can you tell me about your driving habits on such straight acceleration sections?

Speaker 2:
It's not fixed, but I press the accelerator deeply.

Speaker 1:
It's not fixed, you gradually press it deeper. Right, at what point or speed do you stop pressing the accelerator? How do you judge when to stop?

Speaker 2:
If there are cars on the road, I follow the flow of traffic. If there are no cars, I follow the speed limit.

Speaker 1:
So, once you reach the desired speed, you stop pressing the accelerator. After that, you release the accelerator and let the car coast, right? Not exactly coasting, but letting the car maintain its speed using its inertia.

Speaker 2:
No, I maintain a constant speed by keeping the accelerator steady, not completely releasing it.

Speaker 1:
You maintain a constant speed by keeping the accelerator in one position, not fully releasing it. Did you perform any overtaking maneuvers during the test today?

Speaker 2:
Yes, for example, overtaking a bus.

Speaker 1:
I mean lane-changing overtakes. Did you do any of those? 

Speaker 2:
No, the overtakes I did were mostly passing vehicles that were stopped or moving very slowly. The only one was the bus.

Speaker 1:
Alright, can you describe your usual habits when performing lane-changing overtakes? For instance, when a car is directly in front of you, you first move to the left lane, overtake it, and then move back to the right lane.

Speaker 2:
There are two situations: one is when there are two lanes, and you need to move to the opposite lane for a long distance. You must ensure the opposite lane is clear for a long stretch.

Speaker 1:
You need to borrow the opposite lane to overtake.

Speaker 2:
Yes, that's the standard. I make sure there are no cars in my line of sight, then I press the accelerator deeply to overtake, and after overtaking, I either reduce speed or maintain it, depending on the situation.
**Speaker 1:**
When you overtake, you press the accelerator firmly, then slow down after overtaking, or maybe not slow down if the car you overtook was really slow. At least, you press the accelerator deeply while accelerating. The second scenario is when you just need to move to the adjacent lane. In this case, you first check the rearview mirror to ensure there are no cars behind you in the adjacent lane, then you merge. After overtaking, you continue driving normally.

**Speaker 2:**
For example, if there's an empty lane to my right, I check the rearview mirror to see if there are any cars behind me. If it's safe, I merge into that lane. If it's not safe, I stay in my lane unless there's an obstacle.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you don't usually return to the original lane after overtaking a car. You stay in the overtaking lane as long as possible unless there's an obstacle ahead. Is that correct? What do you observe while overtaking?

**Speaker 2:**
I check the rearview mirror to see if there's a safe distance between my car and the car behind me in the lane I'm merging into.

**Speaker 1:**
What is a safe distance?

**Speaker 2:**
It depends on my speed and the speed of the traffic flow. It's a linear relationship. If my speed matches the traffic flow, a safe distance is about 15 meters. If the car in front is slower, I increase the distance.

**Speaker 1:**
So, around 15 meters is a safe distance for you. When you merge into the overtaking lane, how much do you press the accelerator? What speed do you aim for?

**Speaker 2:**
I aim for the normal driving speed, either the speed of the traffic flow or the speed limit.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you don't exceed the speed limit while overtaking. If the speed isn't enough to overtake, what do you do?

**Speaker 2:**
Then there's no need to overtake.

**Speaker 1:**
I understand. You only overtake if the car in front is excessively slow.

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you press the accelerator gradually while overtaking?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I press it gradually until I have overtaken the car, then I maintain the speed of the traffic flow or the speed limit.

**Speaker 1:**
Unless there's another obstacle ahead.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, then I would overtake again if necessary.
Speaker 1:
Unless there's another obstacle ahead. Yes, then you can complete the next overtaking maneuver and let him watch the video. Yes, like this time, after overtaking and returning to the lane in front of the car, you would check the rearview mirror, right? Yes, this is to observe.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I need to see when it's appropriate to return.

Speaker 1:
Oh, so how do you judge the appropriate distance? How far ahead do you need to be before you decide it's safe?

Speaker 2:
In this situation, if I must merge, the safe distance is when I can see the entire front of the car I overtook in my rearview mirror. This indicates that I have completely passed it.

Speaker 1:
You can see both headlights. Yes, this means you have fully overtaken the car.

Speaker 2:
Yes, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's safe.

Speaker 1:
It does indicate safety. Next, there's a right turn. After that, I'll ask you some questions that are not related to driving habits or exposure situations. I'll ask you some additional questions, and we'll stop the video at any interesting points to discuss. First, to ensure safety during this drive, what aspects did you particularly focus on?

Speaker 2:
I didn't change my driving habits, but I...

Speaker 1:
You paid more attention, specifically in what areas? Because paying more attention is more of a mindset. Specifically, did you observe certain areas more, or did you deliberately control certain operations differently?

Speaker 2:
How should I put it? Paying more attention resulted in fewer mistakes, but it didn't change my operational habits.

Speaker 1:
How did it make your operations less error-prone? Theoretically, if you were more attentive, you would observe more.

Speaker 2:
Not necessarily. You can think of it as being in an exam state. It's not that you can't do it, but your state determines your performance.

Speaker 1:
For example, you might observe more frequently, but if you're not paying attention, you might observe but not react in time.

Speaker 2:
That's right.

Speaker 1:
But today, you observed and reacted more quickly, even though the frequency and duration of observations were the same. I understand. Besides paying more attention, was there anything else?

Speaker 2:
No, that's it.

Speaker 1:
How do you think driving can be made safer with today's technology?

Speaker 2:
By reducing average speed and, for example, making smoother stops.

Speaker 1:
So you think...
Speaker 1: With today's technology, driving can be made much safer.

Speaker 2: Yes, by reducing the average speed and coming to a complete stop before every turn.

Speaker 1: So, you believe that driving at a slower speed and stopping before every turn makes driving safer?

Speaker 2: Yes, it does. It reduces the chances of making mistakes.

Speaker 1: I understand. You think the likelihood of making mistakes won't change, but the damage caused by those mistakes will be less. Is that correct?

Speaker 2: Exactly. And besides that, there's nothing else.

Speaker 1: Can you recall any specific driving experiences where you felt particularly scared?

Speaker 2: Yes, on very narrow two-way streets without clear markings. It's quite nerve-wracking when passing another car.

Speaker 1: So, you feel scared when passing oncoming traffic?

Speaker 2: Yes, I'm afraid of collisions or scraping the sides because the road is so narrow.

Speaker 1: I see. Are there any other situations that make you feel scared?

Speaker 2: Another situation is when I'm on a highway, like the Fourth Ring Road, and I need to exit quickly, which requires multiple lane changes in a short time.

Speaker 1: You mean you have to change lanes multiple times in a short period. Why does that scare you?

Speaker 2: I'm afraid I won't make it in time and miss the exit. The distance is too short, and I can't stop completely to make the turn.

Speaker 1: So, when there are many cars, changing lanes becomes more stressful. Are you also afraid of being rear-ended in such situations?

Speaker 2: Not really rear-ended, but more about the difficulty of changing lanes when other drivers don't let you in.

Speaker 1: I understand. Are there any other situations that make you feel scared?

Speaker 2: No, that's about it.

Speaker 1: Do you think you have any bad driving habits that could be dangerous?

Speaker 2: Sometimes I drive with one hand, and occasionally I feel drowsy.

Speaker 1: Anything else?

Speaker 2: No, that's all.

Speaker 1: When you're a passenger, what kind of driving behavior from other drivers makes you feel unsafe?

Speaker 2: Rapid acceleration and deceleration, and sudden turns.
**Interviewer:** When you're a passenger in someone else's car, what kind of driving behavior makes you feel unsafe?

**Interviewee:** Rapid acceleration and deceleration, and sudden steering.

**Interviewer:** So, things like sudden braking, sudden acceleration, and sharp turns. Anything else?

**Interviewee:** Also, when the driver doesn't yield on the road, appears aggressive, insists on changing lanes, and constantly overtakes other cars.

**Interviewer:** Let me summarize. By "insists on changing lanes," do you mean they cut in front of other cars?

**Interviewee:** Yes.

**Interviewer:** And by constantly overtaking, you mean they are always dissatisfied with the speed of other cars and keep overtaking them, possibly exceeding the speed limit?

**Interviewee:** Not necessarily exceeding the speed limit, but they are always overtaking.

**Interviewer:** So, the unsafe feeling comes from the constant overtaking, which involves rapid acceleration, deceleration, and sharp turns?

**Interviewee:** Yes, because this makes their driving seem erratic.

**Interviewer:** So, it's the erratic behavior rather than the overtaking itself that feels unsafe. Anything else?

**Interviewee:** No, that's about it.

**Interviewer:** Okay. When you drive, do you consider the passengers' experience?

**Interviewee:** Yes, I do.

**Interviewer:** What aspects do you pay attention to?

**Interviewee:** For example, if my parents are in the car, I drive more cautiously. If it's friends of the same age, I might not be as cautious.

**Interviewer:** So, if it's friends of the same age, you might drive a bit faster. Your driving style changes based on who the passenger is?

**Interviewee:** Yes, based on my understanding of them. If I think driving slower will make them more comfortable, I will drive slower.

**Interviewer:** So, to make them comfortable, you mainly focus on speed and acceleration?

**Interviewee:** Yes, I try to keep acceleration smooth and gradual.

**Interviewer:** I understand. So, you control the throttle and brakes more gently. Do you pay attention to anything else besides acceleration?

**Interviewee:** No, mainly just that.

**Interviewer:** Alright, the next part of the experiment involves a left turn. Earlier, we discussed right turns. Let's talk about your approach to left turns. Do you observe before making the turn?

**Interviewee:** It depends. If there's a left-turn signal, I just follow it.

**Interviewer:** So, you don't observe anything else if there's a left-turn signal?

**Interviewee:** Right, I don't need to observe pedestrians, bicycles, or other vehicles.

**Interviewer:** But pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles might run the red light.

**Interviewee:** They usually have a long distance to cover before reaching the intersection, so I don't worry about them.
**Speaker 1:**
Pedestrians and non-electric vehicles might run the red light.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but before they do, they usually walk a long way from the open area. During this time, I can always spot them. Also, at that intersection, there is usually a left-turn lane. 

**Speaker 1:**
You mean you enter the left-turn lane first, and then complete the left turn more easily, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, even if I'm not in the left-turn lane, I follow the flow of traffic. Pedestrians and cyclists usually cross with the group, which is relatively safe. In another scenario, at an intersection with no signals, I first check the oncoming traffic from the left. If there are no cars, I then check the right. If both sides are clear, I make the turn slowly while also keeping an eye on the traffic.

**Speaker 1:**
Are the steering wheel, accelerator, and brake operations the same as when making a right turn?

**Speaker 2:**
Basically, yes.

**Speaker 1:**
Is the left turn usually wider than the right turn?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, definitely.

**Speaker 1:**
So, does that mean you need to turn the steering wheel more slowly or make smaller adjustments? And do you brake later because you can go a bit further before completing the left turn?

**Speaker 2:**
It's hard to say, but probably not.

**Speaker 1:**
I see.

**Speaker 1:**
It seems like you don't check the right side of the road early on. Do you assume there won't be any cars?

**Speaker 2:**
I think so.

**Speaker 1:**
Is that a bit negligent?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, and sometimes, if I estimate that there won't be many cars, I simplify the process. If I think the timing and location are safe, I might not check as thoroughly. After simplifying the process, I might glance again after the turn, but it's not guaranteed.

**Speaker 1:**
So, do you usually not check the right side when making a left turn?

**Speaker 2:**
I feel that during the execution phase, I might not check thoroughly. I can't say for sure.

**Speaker 1:**
It seems like you make very tight left turns. Why is that?

**Speaker 2:**
I try to make the turn as tight as possible.

**Speaker 1:**
Generally, left turns should be wider. But at this intersection, you seem to cut in very early, staying close to the left side of the road.

**Speaker 2:**
Because I think...
Speaker 1:
During this drive, I made a conscious effort to stay on the left side of the road early on, keeping to the inner lane.

Speaker 2:
I think this intersection is tricky because there are no traffic lights, and the road markings are not very clear. But if I've already spotted the other car, it doesn't really matter.

Speaker 1:
Got it. So, what driving habits do you think you have that might make passengers uncomfortable?

Speaker 2:
Sudden acceleration and sudden braking.

Speaker 1:
Do you think your current driving style still includes some sudden acceleration and braking?

Speaker 2:
No, it only happens occasionally. Sometimes it's hard to control the pedal, or the car's handling isn't great.

Speaker 1:
Besides that, is there anything else? No? Okay. When you're a passenger, what driving behaviors from others make you uncomfortable?

Speaker 2:
Driving too slowly can be uncomfortable.

Speaker 1:
Too slowly?

Speaker 2:
Yes, for example, when the car in front is going much slower than the speed limit or when it's easy to overtake but the driver doesn't.

Speaker 1:
That makes you uncomfortable?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly.

Speaker 1:
So, if your driving style is very different from the driver's, you feel uncomfortable?

Speaker 2:
If it's just about driving style, yes. If their style is too different from mine, it can be uncomfortable.

Speaker 1:
What is your standard for judging whether a driving style is reasonable or not?

Speaker 2:
I think if I find it unreasonable, most people would too. I usually don't feel uncomfortable.

Speaker 1:
Understood. Are there any other behaviors that make you uncomfortable besides slow driving?

Speaker 2:
No, that's about it. Also, we have a handle in the car that passengers can press if they feel uncomfortable. Would you be interested in seeing the data from when they press it?

Speaker 1:
Yes, I'd like to see that.

Speaker 2:
Great, I'll review it later. After watching the entire video and asking all the questions, I'll give you some feedback. Now, considering passenger comfort, what did you pay special attention to during today's experiment?

Speaker 1:
Let's start with this intersection. It's a crucial part of our experiment because it's a complex, signal-free crossroads. At this point, there is a car approaching from the right...
Speaker 1:
Let's start with this intersection because it's very important in our experiment. It's a four-way intersection without traffic lights, and it's the most complex one. At this moment, there's a vehicle coming from the right in the wrong direction, entering a right-turn area.

Speaker 2:
For example, if I'm on the left side.

Speaker 1:
I look to the right and see a pedestrian crossing. I stop immediately. 

Speaker 1:
Then I glance to the left to make sure no cars are coming before making the right turn. In situations like this, where you're making a right turn at an intersection without traffic lights and encounter a pedestrian, how do you judge the pedestrian's intention? Regardless, you should stop first.

Speaker 2:
First of all, the pedestrian isn't looking at me and doesn't seem to be stepping back.

Speaker 1:
So, you judge whether the pedestrian will continue walking based on whether they look at you or step back. Is that correct?

Speaker 2:
Yes, if the pedestrian is standing in a position ready to walk, I will stop regardless.

Speaker 1:
What do you mean by "a position ready to walk"?

Speaker 2:
Standing on the crosswalk.

Speaker 1:
So, as long as the pedestrian is on the crosswalk, you will stop, regardless of whether you think they can reach the front of your car or not. Even if you think you can pass quickly without hitting them, you will still stop. Is that right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, and then I observe them.

Speaker 1:
To see if they will let you pass?

Speaker 2:
Yes, if they step back, signal me to go, or stand still without intending to cross, I will proceed slowly.

Speaker 1:
If the pedestrian is not playing with their phone and is just standing on the crosswalk, how do you determine if they intend to cross or are just waiting for a car or someone else?

Speaker 2:
I will stop first and then slowly judge the situation. It's like when two people walk towards each other and then step aside. It's a similar process.

Speaker 1:
So, you find it challenging to judge a pedestrian's intention. What characteristics or actions do you look for to understand their intention?

Speaker 2:
I see if they are looking at me or not.

Speaker 1:
So, you make eye contact with them?

Speaker 2:
Not necessarily, but if they see the car, they know it's there.

Speaker 1:
So, you just check if they are looking at you, even if they can't see your eyes directly?

Speaker 2:
Yes, and I also observe their lower body movements and their reaction to my car.

Speaker 1:
So, you pay more attention to their lower body movements. Do you also consider the direction they are facing?

Speaker 2:
Yes, it's basically the same thing.

Speaker 1:
Alright, let's continue.
**Speaker 1:**
Let's continue, and I'll ask some related questions later. So, going back to the previous question, considering the comfort aspect of our course, what specific areas did you pay special attention to during today's drive?

**Speaker 2:**
First, I focused more, which made my reaction time faster.

**Speaker 1:**
Was this consideration for their comfort?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, for comfort.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you make any deliberate changes to make today's drive more comfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
I tried to avoid sudden braking.

**Speaker 1:**
Avoiding sudden braking and sudden acceleration, right? Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
No, just those two main points.

**Speaker 1:**
Okay, so based on today's driving, what do you think you did to make the passengers feel more comfortable? What additional actions did you take to enhance their comfort?

**Speaker 2:**
I can't think of any other points.

**Speaker 1:**
So, to make the passengers feel safer and more comfortable, you mainly focused on reducing sudden accelerations and decelerations, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because fundamentally, the only thing passengers feel is acceleration. So, as long as I control the acceleration, I can ensure their comfort.

**Speaker 1:**
So, from the passengers' perspective, do you think there's a difference between safety and comfort?

**Speaker 2:**
There is a difference, but passengers can only feel one thing, which is acceleration. So, what they feel is either strong acceleration or gentle acceleration.

**Speaker 1:**
If they look out the window, they might also feel the scenery passing by quickly, but I think comfort mainly depends on acceleration.

**Speaker 2:**
And what about safety?

**Speaker 1:**
For example, if they see something outside that makes them feel unsafe.

**Speaker 2:**
But you think it's safe, right?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, they might feel unsafe, but I know it's safe.

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly, they might feel very unsafe, but it might not actually be unsafe. It depends on how the driver judges the situation. So, besides reducing speed and acceleration, is there any other way to make passengers feel more comfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Can you tell me other ways?

**Speaker 1:**
I can share some tips after the interview. Remember to remind me. Now, let's take a right turn and see how to meet the requirements.

**Speaker 1:**
The next few questions might be a bit difficult to answer. The first question is, what do you think makes a good or professional driver?

**Speaker 2:**
Making passengers feel comfortable and safe.

**Speaker 1:**
In your opinion, what...
**Interviewer:** The first question is, what do you think makes a good or professional driver?

**Interviewee:** Ensuring that passengers feel comfortable and safe.

**Interviewer:** In your opinion, what defines comfort and safety? How can a driver achieve these?

**Interviewee:** As we discussed earlier, let me summarize. Comfort means controlling acceleration so that it isn't too abrupt, and ensuring that changes in acceleration are smooth. Safety means adhering to a higher standard than usual, ensuring that passengers never feel unsafe.

**Interviewer:** So, you believe that achieving these two points makes someone a good or professional driver?

**Interviewee:** Yes, in terms of driving. Additionally, in real life, I think there are other factors.

**Interviewer:** Such as looking professional?

**Interviewee:** Or dressing professionally.

**Interviewer:** So, aspects outside of driving that give a professional impression.

**Interviewee:** For example, my appearance might not convey that.

**Interviewer:** Understood. What do you think is the biggest difference between experienced and novice drivers?

**Interviewee:** Novice drivers tend to be more cautious.

**Interviewer:** Like yourself, perhaps?

**Interviewee:** Experienced drivers make fewer mistakes.

**Interviewer:** Significantly fewer mistakes.

**Interviewee:** Yes, if we compare the average performance, the difference might not be huge, but the mistake rate is crucial.

**Interviewer:** Let's recall a scenario. Imagine two large trucks are parked side by side, blocking your view significantly. How would you handle this situation?

**Interviewee:** First, I would check for oncoming traffic. Then, I would move to the opposite lane if it's clear, keeping a safe distance from the trucks to avoid any sudden obstacles.

**Interviewer:** You mean moving in front of the trucks?

**Interviewee:** Yes, and I would slow down, maintaining a safe distance and reducing speed.

**Interviewer:** Back to the previous question, you mentioned the mistake rate. How do you interpret that?

**Interviewee:** It means the likelihood of making errors is lower.

**Interviewer:** But you also mentioned you've never had an accident. Some experienced drivers might have more accidents than newer ones.

**Interviewee:** That wouldn't be acceptable.

**Interviewer:** We're discussing the difference between experienced and novice drivers, not their qualifications.

**Interviewee:** Just because someone has been driving for many years doesn't necessarily mean they're better.

**Interviewer:** If their skill level is high, then we can discuss the difference between good and average drivers.

**Interviewee:** Experienced drivers at least have the benefit of experience.
**Speaker 1:**
If the car is quite old, it doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad choice.

**Speaker 2:**
An experienced driver has the advantage of confidence and better handling of unexpected situations because they've encountered them before.

**Speaker 1:**
So, because they've dealt with such situations multiple times, they are more confident and handle complex environments better. What do you think is the main reason for this? Is it the difference in driving mileage or time?

**Speaker 2:**
It's not just about the time.

**Speaker 1:**
So, if a new driver drives a lot in a short period, do you think they can quickly reach the level of an experienced driver?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I think they can because it's all about gaining experience.

**Speaker 1:**
So, mileage is more important than the number of years driving?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. Do you think there are experienced drivers who still lack sufficient experience?

**Speaker 2:**
If their mileage is high, generally not. Unless they stopped driving for several years and then started again.

**Speaker 1:**
I understand. Let's go back to the intersection and review what happened there. Can you describe the situation?

**Speaker 2:**
Initially, I didn't understand what was happening.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you didn't see it at first?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I looked to the right and didn't see anything, then looked to the left and saw it.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you react a bit slowly?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I braked in time. I thought it might be possible to avoid it.

**Speaker 1:**
Why do you think this situation occurred?

**Speaker 2:**
Because of a blind spot in my vision.

**Speaker 1:**
The corner at the intersection?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I didn't see it clearly. Let me recall the exact details.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you not brake when you turned?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't brake enough.

**Speaker 1:**
The car's front went out too quickly, causing the other party not to see you. The speed was a bit too fast. How would you handle similar situations in the future?

**Speaker 2:**
In such cases, I would slow down significantly.

**Speaker 1:**
You mean slow down throughout the turn?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, especially when approaching the stop line, I would almost come to a stop.

**Speaker 1:**
That makes sense. It's quite dangerous otherwise.
Speaker 1:
There is a stop line, and at least when I reach the stop line, I need to be in a non-moving state.

Speaker 2:
Yes, that's indeed quite dangerous. Sorry, it's mainly about his thinking, but because he is executing, so... Yes, yes, do you think there are other significant differences between experienced drivers and new drivers?

Speaker 1:
Experience, yes, and also...

Speaker 2:
Confidence. Is confidence derived from experience or from...

Speaker 1:
Experience.

Speaker 2:
Yes, mainly from experience. Are there any other differences?

Speaker 1:
Also, in terms of operation, inexperienced drivers might not handle the vehicle as smoothly, which can give people a sense of...

Speaker 2:
What causes this? Is it also due to experience?

Speaker 1:
Yes, it is.

Speaker 2:
You already have...

Speaker 1:
Alright, the next question might be a bit challenging, so please think carefully before answering. In which aspects do you think autonomous vehicles will never be able to match human drivers? I think there are none. Do you think there are absolutely none?

Speaker 2:
If we consider a time span of 100 years or even 15 years, I think autonomous vehicles can achieve it. I believe this is definitely possible.

Speaker 1:
Why do you think so?

Speaker 2:
Because their perception ability is higher than humans, their reaction speed is faster, and they can have much more experience than humans.

Speaker 1:
But there are still many limitations, right? Do you think there are any current limitations that might be resolved in the future?

Speaker 2:
Yes, there are current limitations. If we consider the future, there might be...

Speaker 1:
What do you think are the current limitations, and what might be resolved in the future?

Speaker 2:
I think handling unexpected situations might be challenging because, for example, if the data points are not covered, the vehicle might not know how to handle it. Or if there are no lane markings, it might not know how to drive. Or in places without roads, how would it navigate? And how would it recognize an unfamiliar object? Another issue is that there are currently very few autonomous vehicles, and most cars are still manually controlled. This can lead to autonomous vehicles thinking they can handle manual driving, but they can't. If in the future all cars are autonomous and interconnected, the error rate would significantly decrease, and efficiency would be very high.

Speaker 1:
Alright, let's continue watching the video. Here, we are making a right turn onto the main road. We have two more questions. The first one is a follow-up to the previous question: How do you judge the intentions of pedestrians, non-motorized vehicles, and motor vehicles while driving? Let's start with pedestrians. We touched on this a bit earlier. The main way you judge is by looking at their faces or their eyes to see if they have noticed you. Then, you look at their leg movements, for example, if they are stepping back or if they are giving you a signal to go first. What kind of signals do you see most often? Hand gestures? Do pedestrians often use hand gestures to signal you? Besides these two methods, are there any other ways you judge their intentions?
**Speaker 1:**
What are the most common ways pedestrians signal their intentions to you? Hand gestures? Besides these two, are there any other ways you can judge their intentions? For example, if someone is just standing by the roadside, how do you determine if they want to cross or stay?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it's hard to judge. It's like when two people meet in a hallway.

**Speaker 1:**
You think they will move left, but they also move left, and you end up bumping into each other, right? So, if both of you see each other and stop, then suddenly both start moving at the same time, what do you usually do in such situations?

**Speaker 2:**
If the pedestrian doesn't move, I also stay still. I wait to see what they do. If they move first, I wait.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you always wait for the other person to make the first move, right? You observe their actions first.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, if they are moving, I stop.

**Speaker 1:**
So, if a non-motorized vehicle is moving, you stop to let it pass. How do you judge where it is going? Sometimes, when you are side by side, it's not like a pedestrian at a crosswalk.

**Speaker 2:**
For example, if a non-motorized vehicle is moving in the same direction as me.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, it might even speed up and cut in front of you, right? There are many unpredictable situations. How do you judge its intentions?

**Speaker 2:**
If it's moving in the same direction and the road is wide, I keep a bit to the side to maintain distance. If there's a lane between us, it's usually fine.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you still try to judge its intentions?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but the reaction time is longer.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you use to make that judgment?

**Speaker 2:**
If I see it moving towards me, I slow down.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you know if it will turn towards you?

**Speaker 2:**
Usually, there are no hand signals. I watch for the start of a turn.

**Speaker 1:**
What does the start of a turn look like? Is it a movement of the vehicle, the person, or a change in trajectory?

**Speaker 2:**
A change in trajectory to the left.

**Speaker 1:**
So, mostly by observing the trajectory. Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
It's difficult to say. 

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, let's keep it simple. How do you judge non-motorized vehicles?
Speaker 1:
Besides that, right, it's very minor. And...

Speaker 2:
I think it's difficult, an L or not an L.

Speaker 1:
Okay, we can start simple. How do you determine if a non-motorized vehicle will stop or keep going?

Speaker 2:
By slowing down? I observe if they gradually reduce speed, and when they slow down to a certain point, they put their foot down to support the vehicle.

Speaker 1:
So, you judge by the slowing down and the rider's foot movement to determine if they will stop. How do you determine if they will keep going?

Speaker 2:
You mean if they don't show any signs of stopping?

Speaker 1:
Yes, if they don't make any stopping motions, then they are likely to keep going. How do you determine if they will turn left or right, or if they will change lanes?

Speaker 2:
I think it's difficult to judge. First, I slow down and observe them.

Speaker 1:
Yes, we first observe because most...

Speaker 2:
...don't use turn signals. Some do, though.

Speaker 1:
Right. For motor vehicles, brake lights and turn signals are easier to judge. But in situations where drivers don't use turn signals, like in Beijing where many drivers don't use them, or when they release the accelerator without triggering the brake lights, how do you determine their intentions? What characteristics do you observe?

Speaker 2:
Generally, if they are in the far left or far right lane, they might be preparing to turn left or right.

Speaker 1:
The far left or far right lane, right. Anything else?

Speaker 2:
If they don't use turn signals, it's hard to judge. I rely on other cues.

Speaker 1:
Got it. So, you don't have other methods if they don't use signals. Lastly, let's talk about U-turns.

Speaker 2:
I have to wait a long time.

Speaker 1:
Okay, so if you have to wait a long time...

Speaker 2:
...for a U-turn.

Speaker 1:
Because the car in front didn't make the turn. This situation is similar to the previous one. If you encounter a pedestrian, you mentioned you would wait for them to completely pass before moving. What if they stop and don't move?

Speaker 2:
It would be an awkward standoff.

Speaker 1:
So, if you both stop and wait, what would you do?

Speaker 2:
If it's a conflicting situation, I would let them go first.
Speaker 1:
So, if you find yourself in a standoff situation, or if both of you stop and go repeatedly, what would you do?

Speaker 2:
If it's a conflict situation, I would let the other driver go first. If they don't move for a long time, I would wait for about 15 minutes before taking any action.

Speaker 1:
But in another scenario, if you move and they still don't, how would you signal to them that they need to go first?

Speaker 2:
I would flash my headlights.

Speaker 1:
You would flash your headlights twice?

Speaker 2:
Yes.

Speaker 1:
Using the high beams, right? You would use the lights to communicate your intentions. Do you think they would notice the signal during the day?

Speaker 2:
They should notice it during the day as well.

Speaker 1:
Definitely, but you would still flash the lights.

Speaker 2:
Not necessarily. It depends on the situation.

Speaker 1:
Got it. I don't have any more questions for now.

Speaker 1:
Okay.

Speaker 2:
This was covered in Chapter 9.

Speaker 1:
Other drivers might find it more comfortable. Would you agree?

Speaker 2:
Yes, comfortable.

Speaker 1:
You mentioned deliberately avoiding potholes and bumps on the road, and handling the steering wheel, brakes, and accelerator smoothly.

Speaker 1:
It seems like there are no issues at the moment.

Speaker 1:
Can I ask another question?

Speaker 1:
It seems like they didn't take much action. I have a form here that needs to be filled out regarding your report.

Speaker 1:
I'm not familiar with it, sorry.

Speaker 2:
No problem, I thought it would be more convenient to provide the information this way.
