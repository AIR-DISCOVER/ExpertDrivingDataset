**Transcript:**

**Speaker 1:**
You can start.

**Speaker 1:**
Wait.

**Speaker 2:**
I think my microphone should be off. What do you think?

**Speaker 2:**
The perspective you had while driving is different from what we see here because this view is wider and shows more. So, we need you to describe what you saw at that moment and why you made certain decisions. Please be specific and detailed. Our interview aims to thoroughly explore the details of your driving process, including your observations. Yes, everything will be very detailed. Do you need to check your microphone?

**Speaker 1:**
The driver can say a few words. Should I speak now? Yes, if you are transcribing, check it.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, sir, please say a few words to test it.

**Speaker 1:**
No, wait.

**Speaker 2:**
Is it working? It's a bit unclear.

**Speaker 2:**
Hello, hello, sir, please speak. It should be fine. Okay, we are ready to start the interview. I will share my screen.

**Speaker 2:**
Alright, what you see here is a panoramic video. You can zoom in and drag it around. If you need to see any specific view outside the car, let me know, and I will adjust it for you. If you find anything interesting or need to pause, I will do so immediately. I will also pause if I have questions for you. Just relax and chat as usual.

**Speaker 2:**
As I mentioned before, we will explore your driving habits and specific actions today, and ask about the reasons behind them. If there are any questions you don't want to answer, just let me know, and I won't press further. Lastly, I want to emphasize that all the data we collect is anonymized, and we will not disclose your personal information.

**Speaker 2:**
So, we are only recording audio to transcribe our conversation into text. We are not recording video or taking photos, so you can be assured of your privacy. Let's start. First, let the car move around the parking lot. I will ask you some simple questions. Before today's experiment, what types of cars have you driven? For example, SUVs, sedans, off-road vehicles?
Interviewer: Let me start with some simple questions. Before today's experiment, what types of cars have you driven? For example, SUVs, sedans, off-road vehicles, and whether they were gasoline, electric, or hybrid cars.

Interviewee: I've driven electric cars, yes, electric cars.

Interviewer: Have you driven any other types, like hybrids?

Interviewee: No, I haven't driven hybrids.

Interviewer: So, mostly gasoline cars?

Interviewee: Yes, mostly gasoline cars.

Interviewer: What types of vehicles have you driven? SUVs, sedans, off-road vehicles?

Interviewee: At home, we have two cars. One is a Honda, which I drive frequently, and the other is an Audi. There's also another one, but I won't go into details.

Interviewer: Alright, if I need more specific information later, I'll ask you. You don't need to go into details now.

Interviewee: I've also driven a Dongfeng Warrior armored vehicle. Do you know it?

Interviewer: Is it the Warrior model?

Interviewee: Yes, it's used by peacekeeping forces and other sensitive units.

Interviewer: That's fine, no problem.

Interviewee: It's supplied to peacekeeping forces and the armed police. I've also driven sports cars, regular sedans, SUVs, business cars, and manual transmission cars. I've driven almost all types, including modified cars.

Interviewer: Great. Have you driven any vehicles with driver assistance features, like cruise control, adaptive cruise control, or automatic start-stop?

Interviewee: Yes, our Audi has all those features.

Interviewer: Can you share more about that? Which model of Audi and what specific features?

Interviewee: It's the Audi Q7, the new model.

Interviewer: Which features left the deepest impression on you?

Interviewee: Cruise control, especially. I often use it on highways. One memorable incident was when I was driving out of our neighborhood, and an elderly woman on a bicycle suddenly crossed the road. She shouldn't have been crossing, and my car was going about 70 km/h, just 10 meters away from her. The car automatically braked without me pressing the pedal.

Interviewer: Did you try to steer away?

Interviewee: I did react, but the elderly woman stopped in the middle of the road. The car's automatic braking system kicked in and stopped the car in time.
**Speaker 1:**
Was it because you didn't react in time when the elderly lady crossed the road?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I did react. I wouldn't have hit her, but she suddenly stopped in the middle of the road. You know, when someone stops abruptly in the middle, it's hard to react in time. So, I slammed on the brakes, and the car just stopped.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you wouldn't have hit the pedestrian anyway.

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly, but she was still moving towards me.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, she was already crossing. I was driving this way, and she was walking across. Normally, we would expect her to just cross the road because there were no cars in that lane. If there's no car, you should just cross, right?

**Speaker 2:**
And then she stopped in the middle of the road?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, she stopped right in front of me. I thought she might be trying to cause an accident on purpose. I had already reacted, but the car's automatic braking system kicked in and stopped the car.

**Speaker 2:**
So, the car's automatic braking system activated.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, at a speed of 70 mph. It really startled me. It gave me quite a scare.

**Speaker 2:**
Besides the automatic braking system, what other features do you use frequently, like cruise control? How do you feel about it?

**Speaker 1:**
I use cruise control often. It's quite common in cars, like in Honda. This technology has been around for a while. It's pretty standard. You set it to a certain speed, and it maintains that speed.

**Speaker 2:**
Do you find this feature useful or not? Are there any issues with it?

**Speaker 1:**
It's convenient when there are few cars on the road. But when there are many cars, I don't recommend using it.

**Speaker 2:**
Why don't you recommend using it in heavy traffic?

**Speaker 1:**
Because in heavy traffic, you need to brake frequently. If the car in front of you brakes, you have to brake too. When you brake, the cruise control gets deactivated.

**Speaker 2:**
It automatically turns off, right?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, so it's better to use it when there are fewer cars.

**Speaker 2:**
Have you used any other features besides these two?

**Speaker 1:**
I've also driven a Volvo XC90 with driver assistance features. But I didn't find the driver assistance very useful.

**Speaker 2:**
Which features did you find not very useful?

**Speaker 1:**
When driving on certain road conditions or dangerous roads, those features didn't seem to activate. They never came into play when I was driving.

**Speaker 2:**
Have you experienced any other features, or are there any features you found particularly difficult to use? For example, after that incident, do you still use the automatic braking system?
**Interviewer:** Have you experienced any other features? Or is there any feature that you found particularly difficult to use? For example, the automatic braking system—do you always keep it on after that one incident?

**Interviewee:** I think it's better not to use it.

**Interviewer:** But your car has it built-in, right? So, you haven't turned it off?

**Interviewee:** Yes, I haven't turned it off. It only activated that one time with the elderly lady.

**Interviewer:** Got it.

**Interviewee:** The intelligent start-stop feature is actually quite good.

**Interviewer:** You mean at traffic lights?

**Interviewee:** Yes, when the light turns red, the car stops automatically. And when it turns green, it starts again.

**Interviewer:** So, it starts automatically when the light turns green?

**Interviewee:** Yes, exactly. Our other car does the same. When the car in front moves, it detects it and starts automatically. This intelligent start-stop technology seems to be quite common.

**Interviewer:** Do you find it useful?

**Interviewee:** It's useful about half the time because every time you start the car, it needs to go through the process again.

**Interviewer:** So, it has to turn off and then start again, right?

**Interviewee:** Yes, it consumes more fuel.

**Interviewer:** So, it actually uses more fuel than just idling?

**Interviewee:** Yes.

**Interviewer:** So, the automatic start-stop feature doesn't really save fuel then. It was probably designed to let you relax your foot a bit. But you can also relax by putting the car in neutral or park.

**Interviewee:** Yes, exactly. But it completely shuts off the engine.

**Interviewer:** So, it shuts off the engine, and you have to keep your foot on the brake for it to stay off. If you lift your foot, it starts again. It might be better to just put the car in neutral and use the handbrake when waiting at a light.

**Interviewee:** Yes, it uses more fuel than idling.

**Interviewer:** Understood. Do you usually drive short distances or long distances in the city?

**Interviewee:** Both, really. Anywhere from 20 to 50 kilometers, sometimes 20 to 60 kilometers.

**Interviewer:** So, you drive less than 20 kilometers less often?

**Interviewee:** Yes, that's right.

**Interviewer:** Got it. How did you feel driving our vehicle today? Did anything affect your driving or was it different from your usual driving habits?

**Interviewee:** Not really. I drive a lot of different cars, so it felt pretty similar.

**Interviewer:** One more question, which might be a bit sensitive. Have you ever been involved in any traffic accidents?

**Interviewee:** No, I haven't. Not even a minor scrape.

**Interviewer:** No accidents at all. Understood.
**Interviewer:** Have you ever been involved in any traffic accidents while driving?

**Interviewee:** No, I haven't. I haven't even had any minor scrapes.

**Interviewer:** Alright, let's start by looking at this eye-tracking data, not the panoramic video. Before we get to situations like turning at intersections or making U-turns, I'll ask about your driving habits. After discussing your habits, we'll observe the video to see your specific actions. The first scenario is a right turn. Could you describe your usual acceleration habits when making a right turn or any turn?

**Interviewee:** When I'm about to make a turn, I first check the side mirror, then the rearview mirror.

**Interviewer:** So, you check the side mirrors and the rearview mirror. Do you follow a specific order?

**Interviewee:** No, I don't have a specific order. I just check whichever side has traffic.

**Interviewer:** So, you don't have a habit of checking one side before the other?

**Interviewee:** No, I don't.

**Interviewer:** Whether it's a right turn or a left turn, you don't follow a specific sequence?

**Interviewee:** If I'm making a right turn, I look to the right. I check the upper mirror to see if there are any cars behind me, and then I check the right side mirror for the same reason.

**Interviewer:** What additional information do you get from the upper mirror compared to the side mirrors?

**Interviewee:** The upper mirror gives me a wider field of view.

**Interviewer:** I understand it provides a wider view, but what specific areas does it cover that the side mirrors don't?

**Interviewee:** It's just a personal habit.

**Interviewer:** So, it's a personal habit. When making a right turn, you don't usually check the left side mirror?

**Interviewee:** Correct.

**Interviewer:** Can I ask what you mainly observe in the right side mirror?

**Interviewee:** I look for bicycles, pedestrians, and electric scooters. If there's nothing that could cause an issue, I proceed.

**Interviewer:** And the upper mirror, you use it to check for vehicles behind you?

**Interviewee:** Yes, the upper mirror gives me a broader view of the road conditions, which helps me drive better.

**Interviewer:** Doesn't the upper mirror mostly show the rear passengers?

**Interviewee:** No, it’s more about the traffic behind me. I drive an SUV, which is higher and larger, so the rear passengers appear smaller and don't obstruct my view.

**Interviewer:** So, because you drive an SUV, the rear window provides a wider field of view compared to a sedan?

**Interviewee:** Yes, exactly. And when making a right turn, I look out for pedestrians.
**Speaker 1:** The windows provide a wider field of view compared to a sedan, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:** When you mentioned earlier that you check for pedestrians when making a right turn, what do you observe through the front windshield when you're not turning right? And what is the sequence of your observations?

**Speaker 1:** I first observe the vehicle closest to me, directly in front of me.

**Speaker 2:** So, you first check the vehicle closest to you, right.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, the one directly in front of me. Then I scan both sides.

**Speaker 2:** You scan both the left and right sides without a specific order, right?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, exactly. There's no fixed sequence.

**Speaker 2:** We noticed that you tend to stay close to the left side of the lane. Can you explain why you keep your car towards the left side of the lane?

**Speaker 1:** I tend to drift left gradually. Is that what you mean?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, you gradually move towards the left. Why is that?

**Speaker 1:** It might be because, for example, if I need to make a right turn, I position myself slightly to the left to give myself more space for the turn.

**Speaker 2:** Are you concerned about hitting the right-side barrier or scraping the right side of your car?

**Speaker 1:** Not exactly. When I was learning to drive, my parents advised me to leave more space on the right when making a right turn by positioning the car slightly to the left. This habit has stuck with me.

**Speaker 2:** After you got your license and started driving on your own, did you find that leaving more space on the right made turning easier?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, more or less.

**Speaker 2:** When there's a bus blocking your view, do you check for pedestrians or cyclists that might suddenly appear in front of the bus?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, I do.

**Speaker 2:** What actions do you take to avoid such situations?

**Speaker 1:** I instinctively tap the brake.

**Speaker 2:** So, you tap the brake when approaching the front of the bus, right?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, I tap the brake. If there's no one, I proceed.

**Speaker 2:** Do you also check other areas to assess the situation in front of the bus?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, I do.

**Speaker 2:** Now, let's talk about merging from a side road onto a main road. Can you describe your usual approach in such situations?
Speaker 1: Up ahead, there's an entrance where a side road merges into the main road. Could you describe your usual habits when merging from a side road onto a main road?

Speaker 2: Sure, just describe it. I don't need to do anything because this part doesn't involve any significant driving tasks.

Speaker 1: Right, for example, if I need to merge from a side road onto a main road that's on my left, I usually signal about 50 to 100 meters in advance to alert the drivers behind me. This might be different for small cars compared to SUVs because SUVs have larger mirrors, which provide a wider field of view. So, even before I turn onto the main road, I can see the situation on both the side and main roads.

Speaker 2: Yes, because you're higher up, you can see over the bushes. But today, you couldn't see, right?

Speaker 1: Actually, today I adjusted the mirrors outward to extend my view. I tried it out.

Speaker 2: I remember you adjusted the mirrors during the test drive.

Speaker 1: Did I adjust the right-side mirror?

Speaker 2: Can I ask why you always stay on the left side?

Speaker 1: I stay on the left because I'm worried that if someone or something comes out from the right, I'll have more reaction time. So, I stay closer to the left.

Speaker 2: When you say "comes out from the right," what do you mean exactly?

Speaker 1: For example, if a taxi is blocking my view, I worry about pedestrians coming out from in front of the taxi or non-motorized vehicles like bicycles or wheelchairs coming from the side. I'm more concerned about people suddenly appearing from the right side.

Speaker 2: So, you're not worried about non-motorized vehicles or pedestrians coming head-on or from the side?

Speaker 1: No, I'm not worried about that. 

Speaker 2: Can you explain why you're not concerned about that?

Speaker 1: It might be related to my driving experience. 

Speaker 2: But even though you've only been driving for a year or two, you've already driven over 10,000 kilometers.

Speaker 1: Yes, that's correct.

Speaker 2: You filled out the questionnaire, right?

Speaker 1: Yes, I just got my driver's license.
Speaker 1: You've already driven over 10,000 kilometers.

Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.

Speaker 1: You filled out the questionnaire, correct?

Speaker 2: Yes, I did.

Speaker 1: When I first got my driver's license, I was worried about things like getting into accidents, especially with large trucks or buses coming towards me. I used to be scared, you know? But over time, I realized that the distance was actually quite far. Initially, I wasn't very skilled or experienced. Now, with more experience, I understand that the woman behind me with her child wouldn't crash into me, right?

Speaker 2: This is a scenario where you enter the main road from a side road. Can you elaborate on your driving habits, such as observing the surroundings, using the accelerator, and braking?

Speaker 1: If the main road is on the left, I usually start by braking. I signal my turn about 150 meters in advance.

Speaker 2: You mean you signal about 100 meters in advance?

Speaker 1: Yes, and then I brake deeply.

Speaker 2: Do you check the left side mirror?

Speaker 1: Yes, I check the left side mirror and not the rearview mirror.

Speaker 2: So you don't check the rearview mirror?

Speaker 1: Correct, I only check the left side mirror. If there are no cars, I proceed normally.

Speaker 2: When you encounter a long merging lane, do you merge into the main road immediately or do you wait until you're further along?

Speaker 1: It depends on the traffic on the main road. If the traffic is fast and there's enough space, I let the cars pass first. If there's a traffic jam, I move forward and look for a gap to merge into.

Speaker 2: I noticed that you sometimes cross two lanes at once to get to the leftmost lane. Is this a habit or a deliberate action?

Speaker 1: It's not really a habit. If I see that the leftmost lane is clear, I might cross two lanes. If there are cars, I only merge one lane at a time.

Speaker 2: After merging into the main road, you need to accelerate. How do you usually handle the accelerator? Do you accelerate quickly to match the speed of the main road, or do you gradually increase your speed?

Speaker 1: I accelerate quickly to match the speed of the main road.
**Speaker 1:** When you mentioned the speed on a main road, do you mean gradually accelerating?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, quickly. I still prefer to accelerate.

**Speaker 1:** Okay, so this part is essentially maintaining a steady speed. Can I ask, on roads like this, what speed do you usually maintain?

**Speaker 2:** This road seems to have a speed limit of 70.

**Speaker 1:** 60, right? You don't need to worry about the exact limit. Just tell me the speed you usually maintain.

**Speaker 2:** If there are no cameras, I might drive at 80.

**Speaker 1:** So, without speed cameras, you would drive at 80?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, without speed cameras.

**Speaker 1:** Understood. On roads like the third or fourth ring roads with an 80 speed limit, what speed do you usually drive at? Do you also drive at 80 when the traffic is good?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, that's my habit. If there are no cars, I might go even faster.

**Speaker 1:** Faster than 80? Yes, faster than 80.

**Speaker 2:** If there's a speed camera ahead, I would slow down. Understood.

**Speaker 1:** I noticed that you tend to keep the car towards the left side of the lane on straight roads. Is this a habit of yours, regardless of the road?

**Speaker 2:** Not necessarily. It might be because there are people in the car, and I want to keep some space on the right side. This way, I can ensure that the left side is clear since it's next to the barrier.

**Speaker 1:** So, you keep to the left to make the front passenger feel safer, keeping them further from the right lane's traffic?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, but it's not just for the front passenger.

**Speaker 1:** For the whole car?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, but if I'm driving alone, I wouldn't do that.

**Speaker 1:** So, you feel that keeping to the left makes the passengers feel safer?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. Can I ask, when driving straight, what distance do you usually keep from the car in front? Today, the road is quite empty, so I couldn't observe your usual habit. Can you tell me roughly how far you keep from the car in front?

**Speaker 1:** About the distance to that manhole cover.

**Speaker 2:** To the manhole cover, right? So, you keep that distance from the car in front?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, about that distance or a bit further.

**Speaker 2:** A bit further than the manhole cover? We'll use the manhole cover as a reference point. Do you usually keep a bit ahead or behind it?

**Speaker 1:** Yes.
Sure, here is the translated and refined conversation in English:

---

Speaker 2: 
Move a bit further, maybe just past the manhole cover. Should we use the manhole cover as a reference point? Should we go forward or backward?

Speaker 1: 
We should move forward.

Speaker 2: 
This distance, yes, a bit more.

Speaker 1: 
Move forward a bit more, or this distance, or just this distance.

Speaker 2: 
Yes, that's about the length of a car. Right, approximately five meters. Okay, then there's a U-turn section ahead. Could you describe your usual habit when making a U-turn?

Speaker 1: 
When I make a U-turn, for example, turning left, I tend to move to the right as much as possible.

Speaker 2: 
Move a bit to the right, so it's like turning right to move left, and turning left to move right. Got it. Besides that, how do you observe and handle the accelerator, brake, and steering wheel?

Speaker 1: 
If I'm making a left U-turn, I usually turn on the indicator 50 to 100 meters in advance. At this point, I check the rearview mirror.

Speaker 2: 
The upper rearview mirror?

Speaker 1: 
Yes, to check behind me.

Speaker 2: 
What do you look for in the rearview mirror when making a U-turn?

Speaker 1: 
I check the distance of the car behind me.

Speaker 2: 
The distance of the car behind you. Why do you check this?

Speaker 1: 
It's not just to avoid a rear-end collision; it's also a personal habit.

Speaker 2: 
Okay, what else do you check after that?

Speaker 1: 
After that, I check the front vehicles.

Speaker 2: 
You check the oncoming traffic, right?

Speaker 1: 
Yes, I check the oncoming traffic on the opposite road.

Speaker 2: 
Which lane do you pay more attention to?

Speaker 1: 
Both lanes are important; there's no priority.

Speaker 2: 
Do you check the right and left mirrors?

Speaker 1: 
Yes, I check both the right and left mirrors.

Speaker 2: 
Do you focus on any particular mirror when making a U-turn?

Speaker 1: 
No, it depends on the traffic situation. For example, if there are cars on the left, I check the right, and vice versa.

Speaker 2: 
When making a U-turn, do you also check the left side?

Speaker 1: 
Yes, if I'm making a U-turn on a dual-lane road, I check the left side if I'm in the outer lane.

Speaker 2: 
You check the left side because the rear of the car might scrape against another vehicle, right?

Speaker 1: 
Yes, exactly.
Speaker 1:
When I'm driving, I always check my left side because if there's another car there, it might scrape mine.

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. So, how do you handle the brake, accelerator, and steering in such situations?

Speaker 1:
I usually stay in my lane but move slightly to the right. For example, I might turn the steering wheel a bit to the right.

Speaker 2:
So, you turn the steering wheel slightly to the right?

Speaker 1:
Yes, just a bit. Then I visually estimate the distance. If I think there's enough space, I turn the wheel fully to the left. After that, I observe the other vehicles.

Speaker 2:
You observe the other vehicles?

Speaker 1:
Yes, this is at a T-junction.

Speaker 2:
Right, a T-junction.

Speaker 1:
I check the oncoming traffic and the vehicles turning right.

Speaker 2:
And you also check the vehicles turning left?

Speaker 1:
Yes, exactly. When I turn the steering wheel fully, I also help it return to the center by applying some force myself. 

Speaker 2:
How do you handle the brakes during a U-turn? Do you stop first and then wait for your turn?

Speaker 1:
Yes, I stop and wait for the traffic to move. Once there's space, I proceed.

Speaker 2:
Do you use the accelerator during this process?

Speaker 1:
No, I rely on the car's idle speed.

Speaker 2:
So, you move at idle speed without using the accelerator?

Speaker 1:
Yes, I don't use the accelerator at all.

Speaker 2:
Do you release the brake completely?

Speaker 1:
Yes, I release the brake completely.

Speaker 2:
So, you slowly move the car forward, and once there's enough space, you complete the U-turn?

Speaker 1:
Yes, I make sure the oncoming traffic sees me before I complete the turn.

Speaker 2:
Do you use the accelerator to speed up after the turn?

Speaker 1:
No, I still rely on idle speed. I only use the accelerator once the turn is complete and I need to pick up speed.
Speaker 1:
When do you start pressing the accelerator to increase the speed? At this point, I would definitely reverse, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. Now, stop, stop, stop. Right here. For example, if I turn the wheel further, I might scrape the car, right? So, I would reverse to create more space. After creating space, I would turn the wheel to the left because I need to merge into this lane.

Speaker 1:
Yes, because when you reverse, you might turn the wheel to the right. Then, when you shift to drive, you would turn the wheel to the left again.

Speaker 2:
When you shift to drive, do you turn the wheel all the way to the left?

Speaker 1:
No, I wouldn't turn it all the way. It depends on which lane I'm entering. If I'm entering the left lane, I would turn it more.

Speaker 2:
If you're entering the right lane, you wouldn't need to turn it all the way.

Speaker 1:
Exactly.

Speaker 2:
So, at this point, you would press the accelerator. Once you have enough space to complete the turn, you start pressing the accelerator.

Speaker 1:
Yes, at this point, I would press the accelerator to make the turn.

Speaker 2:
How do you press the accelerator in this situation? Do you press it hard?

Speaker 1:
It depends. Since we're about to make a right turn, I would press it gently, not too hard.

Speaker 2:
So, you would increase the speed to match the main road's speed.

Speaker 1:
Yes, to around 60 or 70 km/h.

Speaker 2:
Then, you would press it again at the turn. I wanted to ask, during the formal experiment, did you complete the process of changing lanes and braking?

Speaker 1:
Changing lanes and braking?

Speaker 2:
Sorry, I meant changing lanes and overtaking.

Speaker 1:
During the experiment?

Speaker 2:
Yes, during the formal experiment.

Speaker 1:
I don't think we did that. It was computer-operated.

Speaker 2:
Okay, so it wasn't done manually. I wanted to ask about your usual habits when overtaking and changing lanes.

Speaker 1:
When overtaking, I usually decide which direction to go first.

Speaker 2:
So, you would check the right side first?

Speaker 1:
No, I mean, for example, if I want to overtake on the left lane, I would first check the left side mirror, then the rearview mirror.

Speaker 2:
Do you check the rearview mirror before or after overtaking? Why do you check it?

Speaker 1:
I check it to ensure there are no cars behind me before I overtake.
**Speaker 2:**
Do you check the rearview mirror after overtaking, or do you check it before overtaking? Why do you check it?

**Speaker 1:**
Well, you need to check it to get an overall view of the lane and the traffic behind you. So, yes, I do check it.

**Speaker 2:**
Does the rearview mirror show the situation in multiple lanes behind you, or does it only show the lane directly behind your car?

**Speaker 1:**
It shows the situation in one lane.

**Speaker 2:**
So, generally, you can see two or three lanes behind you?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, about two or three lanes.

**Speaker 2:**
So, you scan all the lanes behind you. After checking the rearview mirror, what do you do next?

**Speaker 1:**
After checking the rearview mirror, I look at the left side mirror. I check the left side mirror first, then the rearview mirror. I estimate the distance and speed of the car behind me. If the speed is relatively slow and the distance is sufficient, I proceed to overtake.

**Speaker 2:**
Do you observe the car in the left lane behind you through the left side mirror or the rearview mirror?

**Speaker 1:**
Both.

**Speaker 2:**
So, you observe both and judge the speed and distance to see if there is enough space to overtake?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, exactly. If there is enough space to overtake, I proceed.

**Speaker 2:**
What do you do next if there is enough space to overtake?

**Speaker 1:**
I start to change lanes while continuing to observe the road conditions ahead and the distance to the car in front. I also check if the car on my right is planning to change lanes into my lane.

**Speaker 2:**
If there are no conditions to overtake, do you slow down?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, I slow down and maintain a safe distance of about half a car length or a full car length.

**Speaker 2:**
I have a few questions. When you change lanes, how much do you turn the steering wheel? Some people change lanes quickly with one swift motion, while others do it gradually. Which one are you more like?

**Speaker 1:**
It depends on the situation.

**Speaker 2:**
Which one do you do more often? The second method might be used when there are no cars or very few cars.

**Speaker 1:**
I use the first method more often, especially when the road is clear or there are other cars around.
Speaker 1:
It's more of the first type, more of the first type, and then the second type. Actually, the first type is if the road is clear or if there are people in the car, I would use the first type. The second type is when the distance to the car in front and the distance to overtake are very close. For example, if there's a car in front of me, and I'm on a dual carriageway, I'm in the right lane, and there's a car in front of me, then...

Speaker 2:
There's another car to the left.

Speaker 1:
Yes, to my left.

Speaker 2:
Not to the right, to your left front, my left rear, yes, mine.

Speaker 1:
To my left rear, there's another car, but the distance between my front car and my rear car is just one car length. I would make a quick maneuver, accelerate quickly, and then go. But my speed would be very fast, so it wouldn't affect the car behind me. I wouldn't... Others might drive more aggressively.

Speaker 2:
Hmm, could you describe your control of the accelerator and brake during the overtaking process? Because I think it's not just about the accelerator; you also need to use the brake. If there's a car in the lane you're switching to, maintaining the overtaking speed could cause a rear-end collision.

Speaker 1:
The accelerator...

Speaker 2:
Yes, so I want to ask about your coordination of the accelerator and brake.

Speaker 1:
Details, the accelerator, I press it deeply, which might be related to the car's engine capacity. If I'm driving a Honda, I might press it deeper, but if I'm driving an Audi, I might press it halfway because the Audi has a larger engine capacity.

Speaker 2:
So, it's a 3.0, 3.0T.

Speaker 1:
Yes, so I press it halfway because the Honda is naturally aspirated, so it responds immediately when you give it gas. But the Audi is different because it's turbocharged.

Speaker 2:
Turbocharged, yes.

Speaker 1:
It takes time for the pressure to build up. Also, the Audi has a large engine capacity, around 300-340 horsepower. So, when I press it halfway, the pressure starts to build up immediately, and the turbo kicks in, and my speed stabilizes.

Speaker 2:
What about the brake? Because you definitely need to use a bit of brake; you can't always maintain the overtaking speed, and the road conditions don't allow it.

Speaker 1:
The brake, for example, if I merge into the overtaking lane and there's a car ahead...
Speaker 1: You can't always maintain the overtaking speed; the road conditions don't allow it.

Speaker 2: Brake. For example, if I merge into the overtaking lane and the car in front of me is still quite close, I might keep a half-car distance. The farther away the car in front is, the better.

Speaker 1: Yes.

Speaker 2: So, after changing lanes, you should reduce your speed as soon as you confirm the lane change is complete.

Speaker 1: Right.

Speaker 2: Oh, let's continue watching this video. Here, you made a U-turn and needed to accelerate to match the speed of the main road. Could you tell me about your driving habits on such straight acceleration roads?

Speaker 1: Yes, I tend to press the accelerator quite hard.

Speaker 2: So, you quickly increase the car's speed, right?

Speaker 1: Yes, if it's a straight acceleration, I will check, for example, the pedestrian lane on the side road, like a crosswalk.

Speaker 2: The entry point is similar to the driving test requirements, and I have retained some of those habits in my daily driving. For instance, when approaching an intersection or any place where pedestrians might appear, I slightly press the brake to slow down.

Speaker 1: Yes, exactly.

Speaker 2: Now, let's talk about a right turn. Can you describe the situation at that time?

Speaker 1: In such a situation, I don't check my left mirror or the rearview mirror. I only look at the right mirror to see the situation on the side road.

Speaker 2: So, you mainly focus on the side road conditions.

Speaker 1: Yes, mainly the side road conditions.

Speaker 2: And?

Speaker 1: I also keep an eye on my front view.

Speaker 2: The front view.

Speaker 1: Yes, for example, when I'm halfway through the turn, I can already see the oncoming traffic.

Speaker 2: So, you check the oncoming traffic situation halfway through the turn. For the first right turn, I didn't ask about your steering and pedal control. Could you tell me about that? When do you usually start turning the steering wheel, and by how much? Do you turn it all at once or adjust it gradually?

Speaker 1: I adjust it gradually.

Speaker 2: At what point in the turn do you start adjusting the steering wheel?
Speaker 1: Do you turn the steering wheel all at once, or do you adjust it gradually?

Speaker 2: It's not possible to adjust it gradually.

Speaker 1: At what point in the turn do you start steering?

Speaker 2: I measure and visualize a right angle, you know?

Speaker 1: You try to make a right angle as much as possible.

Speaker 2: Yes, as close to a right angle as possible.

Speaker 1: The closer to a right angle, the better. For example, from this point to that point on the road, you can make a right angle.

Speaker 2: Even if the curve is slightly rounded, it should be close to a right angle. Not a wide turn.

Speaker 1: Yes, because I need to leave space for other vehicles and pedestrians.

Speaker 2: Whether it's a left turn or a right turn, it's the same. Understood. Now, about returning the steering wheel, when do you start doing that?

Speaker 1: Returning the steering wheel? It should be just after entering the turn.

Speaker 2: Some people start returning the wheel gradually in the middle of the turn, while others do it all at once after the turn.

Speaker 1: I start returning it gradually in the middle of the turn.

Speaker 2: So, do you actively turn the wheel back, or do you let the car's momentum help a bit?

Speaker 1: I actively turn it back a little, but not too much. Also, I coordinate the throttle and brake. Initially, I definitely slow down.

Speaker 2: So, what speed do you maintain while turning? Do you think it's appropriate to not use the throttle at all and just coast?

Speaker 1: Keeping the speed at 30 km/h is enough.

Speaker 2: So, you maintain 30 km/h while turning. Sometimes you might slightly press the throttle. Generally, you brake to around 30 km/h, then coast without using the throttle or brake. Do you keep your foot on the brake pedal just in case?

Speaker 1: Yes, I keep my foot on the brake pedal but don't press it down. After slowing down from the main road, I coast at around 30 km/h.

Speaker 2: After crossing the pedestrian crossing, you accelerate.

Speaker 1: Yes, because the pedestrian crossing might be a bit further away. 

Speaker 2: Sometimes there might still be people on the road even if they are not on the crosswalk.
Speaker 1: The pedestrian crossing is a bit further away from the main road. I understand.

Speaker 2: So, there might be people on the road, even if they are not on the crosswalk. You need to make sure you completely pass the crosswalk before driving forward, right? Is there anything else? Basically, that's it. Alright, we have a video here. We can play it, and you can point out anything interesting. We can pause anytime you find something noteworthy. I will also ask some questions that might not be directly related to the video, but you can answer based on your experience. So, what did you particularly focus on to ensure safety during this drive?

Speaker 1: I paid special attention to the side mirrors and the rearview mirror.

Speaker 2: What were you observing with them?

Speaker 1: I used them to check the surroundings, along with keeping an eye on the road ahead.

Speaker 2: The road ahead?

Speaker 1: Yes, I kept an overall view of the road conditions to anticipate any potential issues. I also kept my foot ready on the brake.

Speaker 2: You kept your foot on the brake, right. Did you deliberately maintain a certain speed or pay extra attention to anything specific?

Speaker 1: Yes, but not during this part. We did two rounds; the first was a test drive. During the test drive, I drove a bit faster. The passengers could feel the increased speed, which was to test the car's performance.

Speaker 2: Related to the car's performance?

Speaker 1: Yes, but the road conditions were good, so there were no issues. Looking back...

Speaker 2: I asked if your speed today was the same as usual. Did you maintain it differently?

Speaker 1: No, it was different. Today, I drove much slower.

Speaker 2: You drove much slower. How do you think driving can be made safer?

Speaker 1: Driving slower can make it safer.

Speaker 2: Right. Besides driving slower, is there anything else you could do to enhance safety?

Speaker 1: No, that's about it. 

Speaker 2: Can you recall any situations or scenarios from your regular driving experience that you found particularly frightening or unsafe?

Speaker 1: On the highway, for example, when cars in adjacent lanes don't follow the rules and suddenly merge into my lane.

Speaker 2: Sudden merging from...
Speaker 1: "Yes, sometimes there are drivers who don't pay attention or follow the rules. They might forcefully merge into your lane."

Speaker 2: "Forcefully merge?"

Speaker 1: "Yes, they might cut in front of you abruptly."

Speaker 2: "So, they don't leave enough space for the car behind them when changing lanes."

Speaker 1: "Exactly, the space is very minimal. In such situations, I don't get scared while driving. I just react instinctively."

Speaker 2: "Instinctively? How do you react? Do you slow down or steer away?"

Speaker 1: "I would slow down and steer away if necessary. But if the distance is really close, I might have to make a sharp turn."

Speaker 2: "So, you would change lanes to avoid them?"

Speaker 1: "Yes, exactly. Besides this, are there any other situations that scare you while driving?"

Speaker 1: "No, not really."

Speaker 2: "Alright. Do you think you have any bad driving habits that could be dangerous?"

Speaker 1: "I don't think so."

Speaker 2: "Are you sure?"

Speaker 1: "Yes, I think so."

Speaker 2: "When you're a passenger in someone else's car, what driving behaviors make you feel unsafe?"

Speaker 1: "I think it's when the driver is not decisive enough. It makes me feel unsafe."

Speaker 2: "Can you give an example of what you mean by not decisive enough?"

Speaker 1: "For instance, if I need to make a left turn, I check the surroundings and if it's clear, I turn immediately. But if a driver hesitates and takes too long to turn, especially on a highway, it can affect the cars behind them."

Speaker 1: "If the road is empty, it's fine. But if there are other cars, it can be problematic. If I were the car behind, I would be affected by their slow turn, blocking my view and path."

Speaker 2: "Or if they turn left very slowly, it can hinder the cars behind them."

Speaker 1: "Yes, exactly. That's why it feels unsafe to me as a passenger."

Speaker 2: "So, indecisiveness or lack of skill makes you feel unsafe?"

Speaker 1: "Yes, that's right."

Speaker 2: "Got it. Now, let's talk about your left-turn driving habits."

Speaker 1: "Sure."
Speaker 2:
Alright. So, here is the first left turn. Can you describe your driving habits when making a left turn?

Speaker 1:
When making a left turn, I...

Speaker 2:
First, you check the left mirror, and then what do you observe with the left mirror?

Speaker 1:
I use the left mirror, but...

Speaker 2:
First, you check the right mirror. What do you observe with the right mirror?

Speaker 1:
I check if there are any vehicles on my right side.

Speaker 2:
And the road conditions, including non-motorized vehicles, are also important. In the video, we see non-motorized vehicles.

Speaker 1:
Yes, I check for non-motorized vehicles and the overall traffic conditions. When I'm halfway through the turn...

Speaker 2:
When you're halfway through the turn, where do you look?

Speaker 1:
In this situation...

Speaker 2:
Yes, in this situation.

Speaker 1:
I would look...

Speaker 2:
Do you look ahead, through the window, or to the left or right? Because this is also an intersection.

Speaker 1:
In this situation, I would check the mirrors and look ahead.

Speaker 2:
You check the front and the right mirror. What are you looking for in the right mirror at this point?

Speaker 1:
I'm looking for pedestrians or any other obstacles.

Speaker 2:
Yes, to see if they are crossing.

Speaker 1:
Exactly, because there is no crosswalk here. If they want to cross to the other side, they might do so unexpectedly.

Speaker 2:
Ah, I see. They might be riding a bike and cross your path. They could end up in your turning trajectory, and you might not notice them. So, you check the right mirror to observe the non-motorized lane and any pedestrians or cyclists.

Speaker 1:
Yes, that's correct.

Speaker 2:
Is there anything else you do before making the turn?

Speaker 1:
No, that's about it. I always check my left and right mirrors and the rearview mirror when turning.

Speaker 2:
Do you also check the left mirror when making a left turn?

Speaker 1:
Yes, I check both mirrors when turning. It's a habit because they act as my eyes.

Speaker 2:
And the rearview mirror?

Speaker 1:
Yes, I check that too. It might seem redundant, but it's my habit.

Speaker 2:
When making a left turn, do you handle the steering wheel, accelerator, and brake differently compared to a right turn?

Speaker 1:
No, there's no difference.

Speaker 2:
There shouldn't be any difference.
**Speaker 2:**
When you make a left turn, do you notice any significant differences in how you handle the steering wheel, accelerator, and brake compared to making a right turn?

**Speaker 1:**
No, there's no difference.

**Speaker 2:**
So, there's absolutely no difference. And do you follow a trajectory that resembles a wide turn, almost like a right angle?

**Speaker 1:**
Well, if the oncoming lane is clear, I might take a tighter turn. If there are cars, I adjust accordingly.

**Speaker 2:**
So, if there are cars in the oncoming lane, you take a tighter turn?

**Speaker 1:**
No, if the oncoming lane is clear, I take a tighter turn.

**Speaker 2:**
Oh, I see. If there are no cars, you take a tighter turn. And when you make a left turn, you follow this pattern?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, if there are no cars.

**Speaker 2:**
Do you also take tighter turns when making a right turn?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, if there are cars in the oncoming lane or if there's a bicycle lane, I take a wider turn. If there are no cars, I take a tighter turn. Do you understand what I mean?

**Speaker 2:**
Why do you take a tighter turn when there are no cars?

**Speaker 1:**
When I make turns, I always check if there are cars in the oncoming lane. If there are, I take a wider turn to avoid them. You know what I mean.

**Speaker 2:**
But when you make a right turn, the oncoming lane is on your left.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, but when I make a right turn, for example, if there's a bicycle lane, I deliberately take a wider turn to avoid any cyclists.

**Speaker 2:**
So, if there are cyclists, you take a wider turn?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, I give them space.

**Speaker 2:**
And if there are no cyclists, you take a tighter turn?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes.

**Speaker 2:**
I noticed that when you drive, you pay attention to pedestrians as well.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, I'm not really afraid of colliding with another car. I'm more concerned about hitting a pedestrian because the consequences are much more severe.

**Speaker 2:**
Regarding the turn you made today, would you consider it a wide turn or a tight turn?

**Speaker 1:**
Today's turn was a normal turn.

**Speaker 2:**
A normal turn. Do you usually consider the passengers' experience when you drive? Did you today?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, if my parents are in the car, I drive more carefully. If it's my girlfriend or friends, I drive normally. When I'm alone, I might drive faster.

**Speaker 2:**
Do you think you have any driving habits that might make passengers uncomfortable?

**Speaker 1:**
I don't think so. If passengers react, I notice it.

**Speaker 2:**
We can check that later. Passengers usually have a handle to hold onto. Do you want to see if they use it?

**Speaker 1:**
No, I've already checked. There are no handles.
**Speaker 1:** I really wanted to see that. Did you want to see it too? You mean the one with the handle? No, right? You've already seen it. Okay, two passengers. It's just that there were some uncomfortable moments during the drive.

**Speaker 2:** I understand.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, so when you're a passenger in someone else's car, what behaviors from the driver make you feel uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Well, when I'm a passenger, if the driver isn't smooth in their actions, it bothers me. For example, if I want to make a left turn, I check for cars and then proceed immediately. But if the driver hesitates, like when changing lanes or overtaking a car, it makes me uneasy. If there's a car in front and the driver wants to switch lanes but hesitates even though the left lane is clear, it makes me think they're not confident or skilled.

**Speaker 1:** Just to clarify, the previous question was about what driving behaviors make you feel unsafe, like there might be an accident or collision. This question is about what makes you feel physically uncomfortable, like feeling dizzy or nauseous because of the way the car is driven. These are two different issues. If you have more to add about either, feel free. We can discuss safety first, then comfort.

**Speaker 2:** Feeling uncomfortable can also mean feeling uneasy mentally.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, it can be physical discomfort or mental unease. We're distinguishing between discomfort and safety.

**Speaker 2:** Mental discomfort, like I said, comes from hesitation.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, hesitation makes me uneasy. But physically uncomfortable? No, I've never felt that.

**Speaker 2:** So you've never felt car sickness or anything like that?

**Speaker 1:** No, never. I've never experienced a driving style that made me feel physically uncomfortable, like sudden acceleration or braking.

**Speaker 2:** So it's mainly the hesitation that makes you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 2:** Okay, and about the handle, you mentioned that passengers didn't comment on it during the evaluation.
Speaker 1:
Unsafe driving is often due to hesitation.

Speaker 2:
Right, exactly.

Speaker 1:
Yes, that's correct.

Speaker 2:
Okay, so regarding the controls, you mentioned that none of the passengers reported any discomfort during the evaluation. Considering passenger comfort, what specific aspects do you focus on while driving?

Speaker 1:
I particularly focus on speed.

Speaker 2:
Do you keep the speed very low?

Speaker 1:
Yes, I do. Since I have passengers, and I don't know them personally, I tend to reduce the speed a bit. I also try to avoid abrupt movements. For example, when I need to make a turn...

Speaker 2:
By avoiding abrupt movements, you mean...

Speaker 1:
For instance, when I need to make a turn, I don't turn the steering wheel sharply and then quickly straighten it. Instead, I turn the wheel gradually and slowly, and then slowly straighten it back. This way, the passengers feel more secure and comfortable.

Speaker 2:
How does this gradual turning help with the passenger experience?

Speaker 1:
It makes them feel more at ease and reassured. They can tell that I have experience and that I can drive smoothly and safely.

Speaker 2:
Do you think this kind of operation really enhances comfort?

Speaker 1:
Yes, definitely. Gradually turning the wheel is much more comfortable than making a sharp turn and then correcting it.

Speaker 2:
Can you give an example?

Speaker 1:
Sure, imagine you have a cup of tea without a lid. If you make a sharp turn, the tea will spill. But if you turn slowly, it won't.

Speaker 2:
I see. So maintaining a low speed also contributes to comfort?

Speaker 1:
Yes, because driving at a lower speed is noticeably more comfortable than driving fast.

Speaker 2:
So you understand that driving slowly makes passengers feel more comfortable?

Speaker 1:
Yes, exactly.

Speaker 2:
And you think that if a driver hesitates while driving, it feels unsafe?

Speaker 1:
Yes, I believe that if a driver is not confident or familiar with the road conditions, it can be sensed and it feels unsafe.

Speaker 2:
Got it. Besides speed and steering, do you focus on any other aspects?

Speaker 1:
No, not really. I don't consciously control the accelerator and brake differently from usual.

Speaker 2:
So you don't make any special adjustments to the accelerator and brake?

Speaker 1:
No, I handle them as I normally would. If an emergency situation arises, I can't say whether I would brake slowly or suddenly.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, yes, because actually, when it comes to braking and such, if a special situation really arises, I can't tell you whether I would brake slowly or slam on the brakes. Do you understand? Okay.

Speaker 2: Would you make extra observations to ensure comfort? No. So, during your driving experiment today, what do you think you can do to make passengers feel more comfortable?

Speaker 1: It's difficult. Comfort. That's it, nothing more.

Speaker 2: There's no way to make it more comfortable? Okay. Now, this intersection is a crucial part of our test route. It's an intersection without traffic lights. Have you encountered similar intersections without traffic lights before? Yes, can you tell me how you observe in such situations?

Speaker 1: In such cases, I observe very carefully.

Speaker 2: You observe very carefully.

Speaker 1: Yes, I do.

Speaker 2: How do you observe? Because vehicles can come from any direction at any time, and there's no clear rule about who yields to whom.

Speaker 1: Yes, yes, exactly. So, I use the side mirrors and the rearview mirror, as well as the front windshield to get a full view. There's no particular order in this situation.

Speaker 2: In such situations, do you pay special attention to the steering wheel, accelerator, and brake when turning or passing through the intersection?

Speaker 1: Yes, because it depends on the distance between my car and the cars in front or behind me. For example, the car behind me might be directly behind or might move to my left rear or right rear as I turn.

Speaker 2: So, you observe more through the rearview mirror and side mirrors because vehicles can come from different directions.

Speaker 1: Yes, and my speed, braking, and acceleration will also change. I might keep my foot on the brake without pressing it, and I won't accelerate too quickly.

Speaker 2: Is there a difference in difficulty between making left turns and right turns for you? Or do you find one requires more effort?

Speaker 1: There's no difference. I find right turns a bit easier.

Speaker 2: Right turns are easier.

Speaker 1: Because you can turn right on red.

Speaker 2: I mean at intersections without traffic lights. No difference, they're the same. Okay, do you have any additional comments? For example, at intersections without traffic lights, what situations are you most concerned about?

Speaker 1: Because you mentioned, I would consider...
Interviewer: Do you have any additional comments? For example, at intersections with traffic lights, what situations are you most concerned about? You mentioned that you consider many additional factors.

Driver: Yes, I'm mainly concerned about other drivers not paying as much attention as I do.

Interviewer: So, you're worried about other drivers not being cautious?

Driver: Exactly, and also about pedestrians. For instance, in such road conditions, the speed is usually lower, and pedestrians might assume you will yield to them. If a pedestrian is waiting at the curb and I stop, but they don't cross, should I proceed?

Interviewer: You mean, should you accelerate?

Driver: Yes, if I decide to go, but then the pedestrian starts crossing, it creates a tricky situation. That's what I focus on.

Interviewer: Got it. We can discuss this issue in more detail later. So, based on your previous answer, you believe there's no way to make passengers feel more comfortable today, right?

Driver: Yes, just referring to my driving. I don't think there's anything more I can do.

Interviewer: Alright, we'll continue reviewing the video, and I'll ask you some more challenging questions that require careful thought. The first question is, what do you think makes a good driver or a professional driver?

Driver: A good driver and a professional driver, right?

Interviewer: Yes, can you explain why you keep the vehicle on the right side of the road after switching lanes?

Driver: Let's pause the previous question for a moment. I'll explain this situation first.

Interviewer: Okay, you moved back to the right side.

Driver: Yes, because I needed to make a right turn ahead.

Interviewer: So, you moved to the right lane in advance to prepare for the turn?

Driver: Yes, this road has only one lane here, but it splits into two lanes ahead.

Interviewer: Alright, back to the previous question. What do you think makes a good driver or a professional driver? Do you think there's a difference between the two?

Driver: I believe there is a difference.

Interviewer: What qualities do a good driver and a professional driver need to have?

Driver: A good driver ensures that passengers don't feel scared or anxious and makes them feel comfortable. They also pay more attention to pedestrians to ensure their safety. Additionally, they manage their speed and braking smoothly. Overall, a good driver is more observant, drives at a safer speed, and handles the accelerator and brakes more carefully.
**Speaker 1:**
In terms of the force applied, I think I generally observe more and drive at a lower speed. I also apply the gas and brake pedals more gently. I believe this approach should be good for 4G driving.

**Speaker 2:**
What about professional drivers?

**Speaker 1:**
As I mentioned before, I work in this industry. For example, I was the driver in a promotional video for Subaru. I think professional drivers are essential in challenging conditions like rough roads or snowy terrain, where the car's performance needs to be showcased.

**Speaker 2:**
I understand. So, you mean you were the driver in the promotional video, right?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, exactly. For instance, I recently organized an event in Mohe, Heilongjiang, to test new car technologies in extreme cold weather. After that, I had to work in Heihe a week later. The test cars in Mohe needed to be driven to Heihe, which is several hundred kilometers away. Since the cars were unlicensed, we had to drive fast, sometimes even speeding.

**Speaker 2:**
Because the cars were unlicensed, right?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, exactly. Professional drivers can handle such situations. The other drivers I work with are much older, around my father's age or older, and they come from professional racing backgrounds. Despite being younger, I need to prove that my driving skills are on par with theirs.

**Speaker 2:**
So, what do you think are the essential skills for a professional driver?

**Speaker 1:**
A professional driver should possess driving skills that the average person doesn't have. For example, when testing a car's performance, a professional driver can identify which aspects of the car are most outstanding.

**Speaker 2:**
So, they need to understand the car better and perform specific driving maneuvers that only they can execute?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 2:**
Can you give some examples of these maneuvers?

**Speaker 1:**
For instance, when we were in Mohe, there were many forests. Imagine driving through a forest with trees on both sides. The terrain is mountainous, and...
In the dense forest, the path is flanked by trees on both sides. It's not mountainous, but it does have winding roads. The left and right sides are steep. How do you navigate through such conditions?

Speaker 2:
Do you mean driving between the steep sides?

Speaker 1:
No, it's more about handling the winding mountain roads, especially when there's a lot of snow. You need to ensure that the car doesn't skid while making the client or company feel confident about the vehicle's performance. The snow is very slippery, so you have to drive a bit faster and give the car some gas during filming to make the tires spin and kick up the snow. This makes the footage look more impressive.

Speaker 2:
So, it's like providing a filming service?

Speaker 1:
Yes, exactly.

Speaker 2:
And you need to achieve the desired effect that the photographer or the marketing team wants?

Speaker 1:
Yes, but you have to remember that driving fast on snowy, slippery roads is challenging.

Speaker 2:
Driving fast and making it look like the car isn't skidding seems contradictory.

Speaker 1:
It is contradictory, but the skill lies in balancing these two aspects to achieve the desired outcome.

Speaker 2:
What do you think is the biggest difference between an experienced driver and a novice?

Speaker 1:
The biggest difference is experience. An experienced driver can handle situations smoothly and make better decisions on unfamiliar roads. A novice might be more rigid and hesitant. For example, if there's a blue truck on the bike lane, an experienced driver would know how to maneuver around it without hesitation, while a novice might stop abruptly.

Speaker 2:
So, it's about being decisive and smooth in your actions?

Speaker 1:
Yes, an experienced driver wouldn't hesitate and would handle the situation more fluidly. For instance, approaching a blue truck, an experienced driver might brake gently, whereas a novice might come to a complete stop.
**Speaker 1:**
It's tough. For example, if I'm approaching this blue truck, I might tap the brakes, but I think a new driver might come to a complete stop and look around. Right? This is similar to how I was when I first started driving.

**Speaker 2:**
So, what do you think is the biggest difference? Is it experience?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, it's experience. That's the key difference.

**Speaker 2:**
The lack of experience leads to what exactly?

**Speaker 1:**
It leads to uncertainty about road conditions. Essentially, it's about making judgments in unknown situations.

**Speaker 2:**
By judgments in unknown situations, you mean dealing with various unexpected events on the road?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, exactly. It's about how you handle these situations.

**Speaker 2:**
Do experienced drivers handle these situations faster or better? Or do they just avoid risks altogether?

**Speaker 1:**
It's not about avoiding risks entirely. For instance, if an experienced driver knows there's no way to avoid a situation, they might not take action. Have you ever thought about this? I saw a video on TikTok about semi-truck drivers. They mentioned that if they're driving fast and there's a car or pedestrian suddenly in front of them, they might not slow down. They might just keep going because they know they can't stop in time. For example, if a car is very close in front of you, like the distance between me and this computer, you don't have time to react.

**Speaker 1:**
If I'm in my lane and there's another lane to my left, but there's a person or car very close in front of me, I have two options. One, I could swerve and hit them, potentially causing my car to lose control and crash. Two, I could hit them, and they would be in danger, and my car might still lose control after the impact.

**Speaker 2:**
The car could veer into another lane.

**Speaker 1:**
And I could be in danger as well.

**Speaker 2:**
So, it's better to hold the steering wheel tight, brake hard, and if you crash, you crash. If you don't, then great.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 2:**
If you crash, it's just a rear-end collision.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, in such a special situation, it might just be a rear-end collision. At most, it's between you and the car in front of you.

**Speaker 2:**
Right, at most, it's just the two of you. Maybe the back of one car and the front of the other get damaged.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, but if it's a person, I can't guarantee their safety. I also need to ensure my own safety. That's how I see it.
Speaker 1:
The front end is gone. Yes.

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. But if it were a person, I couldn't guarantee their safety, and I would have to ensure my own safety. That's how I understand it.

Speaker 1:
What aspects do you think autonomous vehicles will never be able to handle like a human? This might be a tough question to answer.

Speaker 2:
They should be able to handle things like a human. The comfort level should be there, but in special situations, they might not be able to handle it.

Speaker 1:
So, you think that in certain special situations, autonomous vehicles can't handle things as well as humans? Can you give examples of such situations and explain why they can't handle them?

Speaker 2:
For instance, if the car has adaptive features like start-stop or adaptive braking, it can handle those. But if a person or a child suddenly appears in front of the car, that's what worries me the most. I'm not so worried about adults, but children are unpredictable. If a child runs out, it's uncontrollable because children don't have the same awareness as adults. If an autonomous car encounters a child running out, it might not be able to stop in time. Even if it's just a meter away, it might not be able to stop.

Speaker 1:
But humans might not be able to stop in time either. So, in that sense, they are on the same level.

Speaker 2:
Exactly. I feel that autonomous driving technology isn't advanced enough yet, so I'm not very optimistic about it. But if you ask what it can do compared to humans, there are things it can do.

Speaker 1:
But I mean, there are things humans can do that autonomous cars can't.

Speaker 2:
From a technical perspective, I think it can do what humans can do, but if humans can't do it, neither can it.

Speaker 1:
Yes, it can do what humans can do, but it can't do what humans can't. Can you clarify what humans can do that autonomous cars can't?

Speaker 2:
For example, if I need to drive on a special road and need the car to drift or something, I don't think an autonomous car can handle that.

Speaker 1:
So, you mean if you need to make the car lose control, it can't do that.

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly.
Speaker 1: For example, if you want to drift or something like that, I think it's quite difficult to achieve.

Speaker 2: Yes, you need to make the car lose control, and it can't do that.

Speaker 1: Right, I think so too.

Speaker 2: I understand your point. This is closely related to your profession. For instance, you need to make the car lose control, and the car's posture needs to shift.

Speaker 1: It needs to make a turn, and then you bring the car back.

Speaker 2: Recover it.

Speaker 1: Yes, recover it. I might not be able to control it like that. I don't have that skill, but the professional racers I work with can do it. They can keep the car in that state, let it lose control, and then at a certain point, shift gears and bring it back immediately. Then they can let the car lose control again. You know, I think it's quite difficult to achieve.

Speaker 2: Autonomous cars can't do that.

Speaker 1: Right, if they could, the technology would need to be much more advanced, but I don't think it's necessary.

Speaker 2: I understand. Because in normal driving, you wouldn't do that.

Speaker 1: Yes, in normal driving, you wouldn't.

Speaker 2: No big issues. The next two questions are related to what you mentioned earlier, like when a pedestrian crosses the road. How do you judge the intentions of other pedestrians, non-motorized vehicles, and motor vehicles while driving? Since you mentioned pedestrians, let's start with them. How do you observe pedestrians on the road while driving? How do you judge what they are going to do?

Speaker 1: How do I notice that? Right.

Speaker 2: What do you observe, and how do you judge and predict their actions? Or is it based on your experience that you conclude whether they will move forward or in which direction they will go? How do you judge a pedestrian's intention?

Speaker 1: I usually look at their first movement.

Speaker 2: The first movement, right.

Speaker 1: The first movement, and also their face. I look at their face and expression.

Speaker 2: What kind of face and expression make you think they will behave in a certain way?

Speaker 1: First, I look at their face and expression, then their body movements. But in most cases, I let them pass.

Speaker 2: You always let them pass, but you still judge their intention first.

Speaker 1: Yes, I look at the direction they are facing.
Speaker 1:
Actually, I usually let them go first.

Speaker 2:
So you always let them go? But you still try to judge their intentions first, right?

Speaker 1:
Yes, if they are facing inward, they are likely to go that way.

Speaker 2:
Facing inward? Do you mean their face or their body?

Speaker 1:
Their face.

Speaker 2:
So, if their face is pointing in a certain direction, you think they will go that way? Got it. How do you determine if they will wait for you to pass first or if they will continue walking?

Speaker 1:
I don't really need to judge that.

Speaker 2:
But you mentioned earlier that sometimes you think they will let you go, but then they suddenly move forward, and you have to stop abruptly or signal them to go.

Speaker 1:
What should I do in that situation?

Speaker 2:
Before such a situation occurs, how do you judge if they will move or not?

Speaker 1:
If I can't judge, and both of us are moving, I will stop and let them go. If I move and they also move, I might roll down the window and communicate with them. It's like, "I was letting you go, so you should go." If it’s not about who lets whom, but more about who rushes, I usually let them go.

Speaker 2:
How do you judge if they will rush?

Speaker 1:
I can't really judge that.

Speaker 2:
So, you find it impossible to judge pedestrians?

Speaker 1:
Yes, because sometimes they are on their phones and don't see me. In such cases, I stop. If a car is blocking my view and they suddenly rush out, I can't judge that distance.

Speaker 2:
What about non-motorized vehicles?

Speaker 1:
Like bicycles?

Speaker 2:
Yes, how do you judge their intentions? Is it easier or harder compared to pedestrians?

Speaker 1:
It's actually...

Speaker 2:
Easier to judge pedestrians?

Speaker 1:
Non-motorized vehicles are harder to judge.

Speaker 2:
But you said you can't judge pedestrians either.

Speaker 1:
Why do I say that? Because most pedestrians stay on the sidewalk and not on the main road. They usually cross at intersections or crosswalks. Non-motorized vehicles, however, can be unpredictable.
Speaker 2:
It's just about crossing the intersection. If he doesn't cross the intersection, he won't walk along the road.

Speaker 1:
Right, will he walk along the crosswalk? Now, with all these delivery drivers and couriers...

Speaker 2:
How does he want to walk? How?

Speaker 1:
How does he want to walk? But how do you judge that? It's hard to judge, which is why there are so many accidents now. It's difficult.

Speaker 2:
So you think it's completely impossible to predict the trajectory or intentions of non-motorized vehicles, where they want to go?

Speaker 1:
I wouldn't say it's impossible, but I usually stop at intersections and wait for them to pass. I don't compete with them. Competing directly could cause accidents. I wait until the road is clear or I feel there's enough space before I proceed. No one gets involved.

Speaker 2:
Do you think it's easier to predict the intentions of motorized vehicles?

Speaker 1:
Motorized vehicles should be easier.

Speaker 2:
Besides obvious signals like brake lights and turn signals, what other ways do you use to observe and judge the intentions of motorized vehicles?

Speaker 1:
It's hard to observe. Sometimes they don't use their turn signals but still turn. I keep a safe distance from the car in front of me, so I can make my own judgments in advance. But if they don't use their signals, it's hard to tell. If they suddenly turn in front of you, they might not see you or check their surroundings.

Speaker 2:
Okay. We have one last question. It's similar to what you mentioned earlier. Imagine an intersection without traffic lights. A pedestrian wants to cross the road, and you also need to pass through the intersection. You both see each other and decide to let the other go first. Then you both start moving at the same time, stop again, and this cycle repeats. This situation causes delays and frequent stops. How would you handle this?

Speaker 1:
In such a situation, I would wait for the pedestrian to cross first. It's always better to yield to pedestrians.
**Speaker 1:**
In such situations, I just wait for the pedestrian. No matter what, I always yield to pedestrians. It's a basic rule.

**Speaker 2:**
So, your solution is to stop and wait, regardless of whether the pedestrian intends to cross or not?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 2:**
How do you determine if the person is just standing at the intersection, daydreaming, waiting for someone, or actually intending to cross?

**Speaker 1:**
Usually, the passengers in my car notice my actions. It's not just at one intersection; I make this gesture at every intersection. It's a consistent behavior.

**Speaker 2:**
So, if after making the gesture, the person still doesn't cross, you understand that they are not planning to cross?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, if they don't cross, sometimes I might honk the horn lightly to get their attention.

**Speaker 2:**
Can you show me how you make the gesture?

**Speaker 1:**
Sure.

**Speaker 2:**
Do you use your left hand or right hand?

**Speaker 1:**
I use my left hand, but it can vary.

**Speaker 2:**
So, there's no fixed rule for which hand to use?

**Speaker 1:**
No, it depends on the situation. If the pedestrian is coming from the left, I use my left hand, and if from the right, I use my right hand.

**Speaker 2:**
Got it. Another scenario is when there are many pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles trying to cross the road. In Beijing, it's common at intersections where people gather in large numbers and ignore the traffic lights. If you wait for all of them to cross, you might miss your green light or have to wait a very long time. What do you do in such situations?

**Speaker 1:**
I understand. For example, at the big intersection near our school, there are often such situations. Generally, if I need to make a right turn and there are many pedestrians, I first move into the intersection. Once I'm in the intersection, I wait for the light to change. When the light changes, it no longer restricts my direction, so I can continue driving.

**Speaker 2:**
I see. So, once your rear wheels have crossed the stop line, you can proceed regardless of the light color?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 2:**
Do you let all the pedestrians pass before you proceed?

**Speaker 1:**
Sometimes, if they are very close, I might let them all pass.

**Speaker 2:**
Are there any other strategies you use?

**Speaker 1:**
If there are groups of pedestrians in front and behind, and a few in the middle, I might let the ones in the middle pass before I proceed.
Speaker 1:
Is there anything else?

Speaker 2:
For example, if there's a bunch of cars in front and a bunch behind, and a few in the middle, what would you do? I might let a few cars go and then...

Speaker 1:
Then I would move forward a bit to get ahead of the bunch behind.

Speaker 2:
How do you manage that? Because the cars behind might see you letting a few cars go and then try to follow them quickly.

Speaker 1:
I would move the car forward a bit.

Speaker 2:
What does moving the car forward achieve?

Speaker 1:
It signals to them that I intend to go through.

Speaker 2:
So it's like a warning?

Speaker 1:
Not exactly a warning, just a signal that I'm going through. It's not aggressive, just a heads-up.

Speaker 2:
So you slowly move forward, looking for an opportunity to pass.

Speaker 1:
Yes, if there's someone in the way, I move slowly and carefully.

Speaker 2:
Alright, no more questions on this part. Let's finish watching the video. Do you have anything to add?

Speaker 1:
No, I think that's it.

Speaker 2:
We should head back to the parking lot. There's a form you need to fill out. Do you have a pen?

Speaker 1:
I don't have one on me, but I can get one from next door.

Speaker 2:
I'll get it for you. In the meantime, you can look at the form on your phone and check any details you need.

Speaker 1:
Okay.

Speaker 2:
Alright, I'll get the pen. You can start looking at the form.

Speaker 2:
Okay, that's it. I'll turn this off now.
