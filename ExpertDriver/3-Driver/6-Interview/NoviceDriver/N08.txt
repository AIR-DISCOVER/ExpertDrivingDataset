**Speaker 1:**
Is this not connecting to the mic? I don't love to link it, right?

**Speaker 1:**
Is the second one plugged in?

**Speaker 1:**
Three, it means you need to communicate, right, right, right, and then I need to record, so I turned this on, and it also makes it easier to convert to text. Did I forget to turn on anything? It's been a while, I can't quite remember.

**Speaker 1:**
Were we inviting them, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Wait for 59.

**Speaker 1:**
I don't want you to hear the sound from behind, can you hear it?

**Speaker 2:**
Start recording.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, this is the video recorded with eye movement at that time, it's on.

**Speaker 2:**
Now, please fasten your seat belts, both driver and passenger, adjust your seats. We will arrive near the destination in 80 meters.

**Speaker 1:**
Pause the image first, and let's test the microphone quality.

**Speaker 1:**
Let me say a few words.

**Speaker 1:**
The microphone is on the computer. No, not your computer, on mine. Yes, like this, is it okay?

**Speaker 1:**
Better, yes.

**Speaker 2:**
It should be about right.

**Speaker 1:**
Then the red circle in the middle is where your focus was at that time, and all the red lines are the movement trajectory of your eyes. Yes, but your focus might be in this position in this frame, but you have scanned these positions before. If you are ready, I will start the interview. Okay, today I will be responsible for the final interview session, and we will review the video just now. I will explore your driving habits, and we can stop and discuss at any interesting points. You can ask me to pause at any time. Okay, and if I feel the need to ask you questions, I will also pause. If possible, just say whatever comes to mind, like a normal conversation. If you don't want to answer a question, you can tell me directly, and I won't press further.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, and all the data we collect will be anonymous and will not disclose your personal privacy. Before asking questions related to this experiment, I will ask you some simpler questions to start. What types of cars have you driven before? For example, SUVs, sedans, sports cars, etc., and also fuel cars and electric cars.

**Speaker 2:**
And so on.

**Speaker 2:**
Those small ones, like compact SUVs, smaller than SUVs but not quite small SUVs.

**Speaker 1:**
But definitely not sedans, right, definitely with a higher chassis. Yes, yes, okay. Have you driven both fuel cars and electric cars?

**Speaker 2:**
...
**Speaker 1:** So, it's definitely not a sedan, right? It's definitely not one with a higher chassis. Right, okay. Have you ever driven an electric car?

**Speaker 2:** No, I haven't.

**Speaker 1:** Never driven an electric car. Hmm, have any of the cars you've driven before had any driver assistance features?

**Speaker 2:** Does auto hold count?

**Speaker 1:** What is auto hold? Is it a heads-up display?

**Speaker 2:** No, auto hold is when, for example, you're waiting at a red light, and you press the brake, it automatically holds the car in place until you press the accelerator again.

**Speaker 1:** So, it's like an automatic handbrake or auto stop?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it's like an automatic handbrake.

**Speaker 1:** Got it. So, you don't have to keep pressing the brake pedal; it just stays put. Any other driver assistance features that you remember?

**Speaker 2:** Not really, just the common ones like cruise control.

**Speaker 1:** Have you used cruise control on the highway?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I have.

**Speaker 1:** Can you tell me which car it was? Do you remember?

**Speaker 2:** I currently drive an Audi A1. I've also driven a Subaru and a Volkswagen recently. In the past one or two months, I've driven three different Volkswagens. I used cruise control on the Subaru while driving on the highway.

**Speaker 1:** How do you find using cruise control? Do you think it's useful?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it's useful, but it's not perfect. You still have to pay attention. It helps with the driving, especially on long trips where keeping your foot on the gas pedal can be tiring. But if the traffic is heavy, you still need to brake frequently.

**Speaker 1:** So, you still need to brake manually. And for accelerating, do you have to do it yourself?

**Speaker 2:** No, you can set the speed. For example, you can set it to 120 km/h, and then you can adjust it in increments. If you push the lever up, it increases by 1 km/h, and if you push it further, it increases by 10 km/h. But if you increase it by 10 km/h, it gives a big burst of acceleration, which can be a bit uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:** I see. Do you usually drive short distances in the city or longer trips?

**Speaker 2:** I don't drive much in the city, just short trips of about 3-5 kilometers. I usually drive longer distances.

**Speaker 1:** How long are your typical long trips? 20 kilometers or more?

**Speaker 2:** Usually between 15-30 kilometers.

**Speaker 1:** 15-30 kilometers, okay. How do you feel about the car you're driving today? Is there anything you find uncomfortable or not used to that affects your driving?
Speaker 1: Alright, how do you feel about our car today? Are there any aspects that you find uncomfortable or different from what you're used to driving?

Speaker 2: Well, the car I usually drive is smaller, so when I switch to other sedans, I need some time to adjust because of the turning radius and the power.

Speaker 2: As long as the car is easy to drive, things like lane changes, overtaking, and parking are quite convenient. But when I drive larger cars, it becomes a bit challenging.

Speaker 1: The A1 is quite small.

Speaker 2: Is it? The A1 isn't that small.

Speaker 1: Is it a hatchback or a sedan?

Speaker 2: My car is basically a sedan, and the back seats are rarely used. It's similar to the popular BMW MINI.

Speaker 1: I see, it's that type of car. So, there's nothing about this car that makes you feel uncomfortable while driving?

Speaker 2: No, but there was a moment at a red light. 

Speaker 1: Go ahead, you can tell me now.

Speaker 2: When I was waiting at a red light, I habitually pressed the brake lightly, but the car didn't stop as quickly as I expected because I usually press the gas pedal gently. So, when I finally stopped, I instinctively pressed the brake harder, and then I released it, causing the car to move forward slightly.

Speaker 1: Oh, you forgot about the idle stop feature?

Speaker 2: No, it has that feature. But I didn't activate it initially, and the EEL system suggests not to operate any equipment after starting the experiment. I realized I hadn't activated the auto hold, so I reached for it but then remembered what was said and pulled my hand back. It's just a habit.

Speaker 1: So, the car moved forward a bit due to idling.

Speaker 2: Yes, it moved forward slightly. Although it was due to my habit of braking, it was a bit uncomfortable.

Speaker 1: Alright, then. We have a video of your eye movements as you exited the parking lot. I'll ask you about your driving habits in situations like turning and U-turns. First, describe your usual driving habits, and then we'll watch the video to compare your actions today and see if there are any differences. Why do you think these differences might exist?

Speaker 2: Should I start now?

Speaker 1: No problem, we can watch the video first, and I'll pause it to ask questions. Here, you can see the trajectory of your eye movements. Since there are several consecutive right turns at the beginning, could you describe your driving habits during right turns?

Speaker 2: For right turns, I signal, check the left side, and look ahead before turning.
Interviewer: Let's start by discussing your driving habits, particularly when making a turn.

Driver: When making a right turn, I signal first, then check the left side before moving my head forward to check the right side. I look for oncoming cars from the left and pedestrians or small vehicles like bicycles on the right. Generally, I don't make very sharp turns. I have a habit of steering with one hand, usually my left. If the turn is too sharp, I might use both hands to control the wheel better, especially for sudden turns.

Interviewer: Okay, I'd like to ask about some details. You mentioned an observation sequence earlier. Could you clarify that?

Driver: Sure.

Interviewer: Before the car's front wheels cross the stop line, you check...

Driver: Yes, before the front wheels cross the stop line, I make sure to check the right side for any oncoming traffic.

Interviewer: So, you check the right side first, then the left?

Driver: Yes, I check the left side for oncoming vehicles.

Interviewer: And then you check for pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles on the right?

Driver: Yes, I check for those as well, but my main focus is on the left side for motor vehicles.

Interviewer: So, you prioritize checking for motor vehicles on the left side?

Driver: Yes, because when making a right turn, pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles on the left side usually don't interfere with my path. The right side might have a sidewalk.

Interviewer: So, you don't observe before the front wheels cross the stop line?

Driver: I do observe, but sometimes it's hard to see clearly until the front wheels cross the line. I keep looking until I have a clear view.

Interviewer: When preparing to pass through an intersection or make a turn, from what distance do you start preparing and observing?

Driver: I start signaling and preparing to turn about 10 meters before the intersection.

Interviewer: So, you start signaling around 10 meters before the turn?

Driver: More like 5 meters before the turn.

Interviewer: You start signaling 5 meters before the turn and begin observing. You continue to observe until the front wheels cross the stop line, ensuring you have a clear view of oncoming traffic from the left side through the left window and front side window. Your main focus is on motor vehicles on the left. If there are no motor vehicles, you then check the right side.

Driver: Yes, that's correct.
Speaker 1:
When you look through the left window and the front side window, you can see the oncoming traffic from the left side of the road. The main focus should be on the vehicles coming from the left. If there are no vehicles, then...

Speaker 2:
Look at the pedestrians on the right.

Speaker 1:
Yes, start observing the pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles on the right. The main focus on the right side should be on these, rather than anything else. Do you think non-motorized vehicles are more important to watch than pedestrians?

Speaker 2:
Yes, because they are more dangerous and often involved in accidents.

Speaker 1:
So, do you pay more attention to vehicles coming towards you from the wrong direction on the right, or those approaching from the right rear-view mirror?

Speaker 2:
You need to be particularly careful about those coming from behind because you can see what's in front of you, but if you don't check the rear-view mirror, you might miss a vehicle approaching from behind that hasn't slowed down, which could lead to a collision.

Speaker 1:
Got it. So, after checking the left side and then the right side, if everything is clear, you proceed. Do you double-check, or is one check enough?

Speaker 2:
Usually, one check is enough.

Speaker 1:
So, you check the left side once, then the right side once, and then proceed?

Speaker 2:
Yes, that's basically it.

Speaker 1:
Do you also check the left rear-view mirror?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I do.

Speaker 1:
What do you look for in the left rear-view mirror?

Speaker 2:
I check it after my car's front has passed the intersection. As the car is almost through, I look at the left rear-view mirror because vehicles can approach quickly from behind.

Speaker 1:
At this point, has your car completed the turn?

Speaker 2:
Not yet, but it's in the process of completing the turn.

Speaker 1:
So, after checking the right side for pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles, you check the left rear-view mirror again?

Speaker 2:
Yes, especially if I need to change lanes or even if I'm going straight, to ensure there are no vehicles close by.

Speaker 1:
Understood. Now, when preparing for a right turn, at what point do you start to slow down?

Speaker 2:
About 10 meters before the turn.

Speaker 1:
Do you just release the accelerator or also apply the brake?

Speaker 2:
I usually release the accelerator and also apply the brake. My foot is ready on the brake pedal, but I might not always press it.

Speaker 1:
So, your foot is on the brake pedal, but you might not always press it?

Speaker 2:
Yes, it depends on the situation. If the road conditions are good, I might not press it until I'm about 2-3 meters from the turn. If there are any issues, I will press the brake earlier.
Speaker 1: So, when do you start turning the steering wheel? Do you prefer to let the car move forward a bit before you start turning right?

Speaker 2: I start turning after crossing the stop line.

Speaker 1: Do you quickly turn the steering wheel to a suitable position and then make the turn, or do you adjust the steering while turning?

Speaker 2: I adjust the steering while turning. I usually turn the wheel to a position where I feel the car can smoothly make the turn.

Speaker 1: So, you turn the wheel until you feel the front of the car can go through?

Speaker 2: Yes.

Speaker 1: If you realize the front of the car can't make it, do you adjust the steering more?

Speaker 2: Yes, I would adjust the steering more if needed.

Speaker 1: When do you start straightening the wheel?

Speaker 2: I start straightening the wheel when the car is almost through the turn.

Speaker 1: Do you actively straighten the wheel, or do you let the car's momentum help?

Speaker 2: It depends on the car. If the steering wheel is easy to turn, I let it straighten on its own. If it's harder to turn, I use more force.

Speaker 1: Understood. When do you start accelerating out of the turn?

Speaker 2: I start accelerating as I begin to straighten the wheel.

Speaker 1: Do you accelerate gradually or quickly to a certain point?

Speaker 2: It depends. When turning, I accelerate gradually.

Speaker 1: So, you accelerate gradually while turning to avoid the car skidding?

Speaker 2: Yes, exactly. If I accelerate too quickly while turning, the car might skid.

Speaker 1: Let's review the footage. At this point, you start observing pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles on the right. There's about a 10-meter distance.

Speaker 1: Do you start observing the left side earlier than you think?

Speaker 2: Yes, I start observing when the front left wheel crosses the stop line.
Speaker 1:
When you check the left side, do you do it earlier than you think? Yes, your left front wheel.

Speaker 2:
The front wheel crosses the stop line, almost. I think it's almost there, the door is just right at that point. Almost.

Speaker 1:
On the right side, there are no cars on the left, so there's no extra reason to check the right side mirror. Because last time, after checking the left side, you didn't mention it correctly, and you didn't check the right rear side.

Speaker 2:
I glanced at it when I was in front. Didn't you ask me at that time if I checked the rearview mirror?

Speaker 1:
You said, oh. So, it's at this position in the front, right, that's what you said at that time.

Speaker 2:
You asked me about it.

Speaker 1:
At that time, you had already checked it.

Speaker 2:
Yes, at that time, I had checked it.

Speaker 2:
Let's spend some time locally, like don't for you yourself there will never stop. Come over. Good, two items.

Speaker 1:
Then the front is a process of entering the auxiliary road. My video is about the process of entering the main road. I won't pause the video for now, and you can describe your usual driving habits when entering the main road from the auxiliary road.

Speaker 2:
At that intersection, I usually turn on the signal, then check the left rearview mirror when entering the main road.

Speaker 1:
We can first talk about how to observe, then how to operate.

Speaker 2:
Yes, for observation, I check the left rearview mirror. I look at the cars on the main road and tap the brake because usually, when entering the main road, there isn't a transition lane. You might drive straight in, so you need to slow down. If you go too fast and there's a car behind that doesn't brake, you might collide. So, I tap the brake, check the left rearview mirror, and if it's clear, I go in.

Speaker 1:
Hmm, I see. So, after entering, do you quickly match the speed of the vehicles on the main road? Yes, so you step on the gas a bit harder?

Speaker 2:
Yes, when entering the main road, I tend to speed up a bit to match their speed.

Speaker 1:
So, when you observe the situation on the left side of the main road, do you do it here or earlier?

Speaker 2:
It's about here, just when entering, not before.

Speaker 1:
Then you can tell me to stop if we haven't reached that point yet. Can we see it?

Speaker 2:
Yes, at this point.

Speaker 1:
Yes, around this time, I saw your head tilted, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I would lower my head a bit, just a little.

Speaker 1:
I understand what you mean.

Speaker 2:
Once I'm in, I don't worry about it anymore because now I'm on the main road. So, if they hit me, it's not my fault.

Speaker 1:
Then this part is about maintaining a steady speed. Can you describe what you might do on a straight road with good conditions?
**Speaker 1:**
So, the first part is essentially a steady-speed driving process. Can you describe your driving habits when you're on a straight road with good conditions?

**Speaker 2:**
I usually drive quite fast, basically at the speed limit.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you ever exceed the speed limit?

**Speaker 2:**
It's possible.

**Speaker 1:**
By how much? Around 20%?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, within 20% to avoid fines.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it. Do you often overtake other vehicles?

**Speaker 2:**
It depends on the road conditions and urgency. Sometimes I want to overtake but can't.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you overtake any vehicles during this experiment?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I did.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you remember where it happened?

**Speaker 2:**
I overtook a bus towards the end.

**Speaker 1:**
Was it necessary to overtake?

**Speaker 2:**
Probably not. I should have waited.

**Speaker 1:**
No worries, we can review that part later.

**Speaker 2:**
Sure, and there's another point where I definitely overtake. For example, if a car is driving at a constant speed below the limit.

**Speaker 1:**
So, if a car is driving below the speed limit, you are likely to overtake?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, most likely.

**Speaker 1:**
On these steady-speed sections, what is your usual following distance?

**Speaker 2:**
About 20 meters, I think. I'm not sure about the exact range.

**Speaker 1:**
Let's check the video to find a distance you're comfortable with. Is this distance about right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I usually keep a bit more distance because I drive fast.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you maintain a slightly longer following distance?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, around 25 meters or more.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, let's talk about your U-turn habits. How do you usually make a U-turn?

**Speaker 2:**
I turn the wheel to the right until it's almost on the line.

**Speaker 1:**
Just a bit to the right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, until the wheel is almost on the line but not over it.

**Speaker 1:**
Which line?

**Speaker 2:**
The dashed line on the right side of the right lane.

**Speaker 1:**
And then?

**Speaker 2:**
Then I turn left, staying close to the line to make sure I can complete the turn in one go.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
Just observing and operating carefully.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you feel rushed when making a U-turn?

**Speaker 2:**
Sometimes, especially if there's a single lane.
**Speaker 1:**
Is there anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
Doing other things.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it's also about observation and operation.

**Speaker 2:**
No U-turns. On a single lane, it might be more urgent because for a left turn, I don't have to wait. If there's only one car in front of me, and it's just a bit short of the U-turn position, I might honk to signal them to move forward a bit so I can make the U-turn.

**Speaker 1:**
So, if you're making a U-turn at a green light, what would you observe?

**Speaker 2:**
At a green light, you need to observe a lot. You have to watch for oncoming traffic, cars turning right from the left, pedestrians, and other vehicles.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you observe all of them?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, basically.

**Speaker 1:**
Who do you prioritize observing?

**Speaker 2:**
Definitely the oncoming traffic.

**Speaker 1:**
When making a U-turn, which lane of the oncoming traffic do you pay more attention to? For example, if there are two lanes, one on the left and one on the right.

**Speaker 2:**
The lane closest to me.

**Speaker 1:**
The one closest to you?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the closest lane.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you describe your observation and operation process during a U-turn or a turn?

**Speaker 2:**
When I make a turn, I first look at the oncoming traffic and the cars turning right from the left. If there are no cars too close, I proceed with the U-turn, slowing down as I go. I try to make the turn in one go if possible. Once I start the U-turn and I'm halfway through, I don't worry about the other cars.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you mean by not worrying about them once you're halfway through the U-turn?

**Speaker 2:**
Once I'm halfway through the U-turn, I don't pay attention to the other cars.

**Speaker 1:**
Where exactly is halfway through the U-turn?

**Speaker 2:**
When my car is almost perpendicular to the road.

**Speaker 1:**
So, at that point, you might be occupying one or two lanes?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I might be occupying two lanes.

**Speaker 1:**
Two lanes, meaning your original lane and the lane you're turning into?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I mean two lanes of the oncoming traffic. My car would be fully in the oncoming lanes.

**Speaker 1:**
So, at that point, you try to complete the turn as quickly as possible?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I try to complete it quickly. If I can make the turn in one go, I will. If not, I won't rush. Even if others honk at me, I won't try to force it in one go because I don't want to risk a collision. I'll try to be quick, but if I need to reverse a bit, I will.
Speaker 1:
When other drivers honk at you, do you feel pressured to make a quick turn, or do you take your time to ensure safety?

Speaker 2:
I try to be quick, but if I feel I need to reverse a bit to make the turn safely, I will. I don't let their honking rush me.

Speaker 1:
So, you position your car across one lane first, then observe the traffic in the other lane before making the turn. You ensure both lanes are clear before proceeding, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly.

Speaker 1:
What is the usual turning radius you use for a U-turn?

Speaker 2:
I turn the steering wheel fully, but it might not always be stable.

Speaker 1:
Do you maintain the car's idle speed during the U-turn?

Speaker 2:
I usually give it a bit of gas, but not too much.

Speaker 1:
Do you apply the gas throughout the entire turn or just at specific moments?

Speaker 2:
I apply a little gas throughout, but I also keep my foot near the brake. I might press the gas lightly and then switch to the brake to control the speed. If I see I can make the turn, I proceed slowly. If not, I reverse a bit and try again.

Speaker 1:
Got it. And when you exit the turn, how do you handle the gas pedal?

Speaker 2:
I start to straighten the wheel and then gradually apply more gas.

Speaker 1:
If you decide to reverse before completing the U-turn, do you immediately apply the gas after reversing?

Speaker 2:
Yes, once I finish reversing, I apply the gas to complete the turn.

Speaker 1:
So, your decision to apply the gas depends on whether you can complete the turn in one go?

Speaker 2:
Exactly. If I can make the turn, I apply the gas. If not, I adjust and try again.

Speaker 1:
Do you check your mirrors during a U-turn?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I check both the left and right mirrors, mainly to watch for bicycles or motorcycles.

Speaker 1:
Do you also check for vehicles coming from behind?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I do. Cars usually wait behind me, but I watch out for smaller vehicles like motorcycles that might try to pass. If the road is not clearly divided, I am more cautious.
**Speaker 1:** What kind of road is this? If it's this type of road, it might be hard to see, but if it's the other type...

**Speaker 2:** You mean the kind without a clear separation from the non-motorized lane, like this one with a green belt?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, the kind with a separation is definitely better.

**Speaker 2:** Let's check today.

**Speaker 1:** You then call you to go...

**Speaker 2:** To the right, towards the edge line.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, in a real experiment, you would turn the wheel sharply. Do you generally prefer to drive in the left lane after making a turn?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I do.

**Speaker 1:** So, you usually proceed with caution, keeping the car at idle speed, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I tend to keep it at idle speed because I'm not always sure if I can make it in one go.

**Speaker 1:** And you only start accelerating after you've fully turned, correct?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, that's right.

**Speaker 1:** So, after making a U-turn, you keep the car at a low speed and then drive straight on the main road. You will inevitably go through a straight-line acceleration process. Can you describe your usual acceleration habits?

**Speaker 2:** I press the gas pedal, observe the surroundings, stabilize in my lane, and then accelerate. I also check the car in front to ensure there's a safe distance.

**Speaker 1:** So, you accelerate more aggressively when the road conditions are good, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, if the road is clear, I press the gas pedal harder to reach my desired speed. Once I reach it, I gradually release the gas pedal and let the car coast.

**Speaker 1:** Do you release the gas pedal slowly to maintain a steady speed, or do you let it go completely?

**Speaker 2:** I let it go completely and let the car coast. If the speed drops too much, I accelerate again.

**Speaker 1:** So, you usually accelerate quickly to the speed limit and then let the car coast?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, that's right. I don't need to keep accelerating.

**Speaker 1:** Understood. If there's a vehicle ahead, like a bus, how do you overtake it?

**Speaker 2:** I overtake it by changing lanes.

**Speaker 1:** I see. It's not a traditional lane change and overtake maneuver, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it's more about finding the right moment to accelerate.

**Speaker 1:** Can I check your dashboard?

**Speaker 2:** Sure, it should be around 80 km/h, maybe 70-something. The speed limit is 60 km/h.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, the speed limit is 60 km/h. Can you describe your usual lane-changing and overtaking habits?
**Speaker 2:**
I was going almost 70. Yes, I understand the speed limit should be 60.

**Speaker 1:**
Right, the speed limit is 60. Can you describe your usual habit when changing lanes to overtake? Start by explaining how you observe the situation for overtaking, then how you judge if it's safe, and finally, how you proceed.

**Speaker 2:**
First, I check the left side. If there are no cars, I merge.

**Speaker 1:**
You mean you check the left side mirror, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes. If there are no cars on the left, I merge and then accelerate. I also check the lane ahead of me. Usually, I can see far enough ahead. So, I accelerate. Sometimes, the car in the right lane is slow, or there might be another car ahead. I assess the situation. If there are more cars ahead, I decide whether to merge back or stay in my lane. If I can overtake the whole line of cars, I will. But if the line is long and there are cars in my lane blocking me, I might slow down and stay in my lane. If there's only one slow car, I overtake it directly and then decide whether to merge back or stay in the left lane, depending on the traffic ahead.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it. When you first check the left side, how much distance do you usually keep from the cars behind you to feel safe to overtake? You don't want the car behind you to be too close, right? How far should the car behind be for you to feel comfortable overtaking?

**Speaker 2:**
The car behind should be about...

**Speaker 1:**
When you check the left side mirror to judge if it's safe to overtake.

**Speaker 2:**
About 5 meters.

**Speaker 1:**
So, if the car behind is more than 5 meters away, you feel it's safe to merge left.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes. If I can see their headlights in my mirror, I accelerate and merge.

**Speaker 1:**
Understood. When you merge left, do you prefer to do it slowly and gradually, or do you do it quickly and then straighten out?

**Speaker 2:**
I signal first to let them know I'm changing lanes, then I merge quickly.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you merge quickly rather than slowly inching in.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because if you do it slowly, the other driver might not want to let you in and could speed up. If there are cars ahead of me, I might get squeezed out. So, I merge quickly, and they usually slow down a bit to let me in.

**Speaker 1:**
Okay. After merging into the left lane, how much distance do you keep from the car in front to feel safe to overtake?
Speaker 1:
Alright. After moving into the left lane, how much distance do you think is enough between you and the car in front to overtake the car on your right?

Speaker 2:
How much distance is there? So, at this point, how much distance is there between me and the car on my right?

Speaker 1:
You just changed lanes, so you're almost side by side with the car on your right. You need to consider the distance to the car in front of you in the left lane. If the distance is too short, you won't be able to overtake.

Speaker 2:
I see.

Speaker 1:
About 15 to 20 meters.

Speaker 2:
Yes, because if the car in front suddenly brakes while I'm overtaking, it could be very dangerous.

Speaker 1:
Exactly, it would be very dangerous.

Speaker 2:
Yes, very dangerous.

Speaker 1:
So, you need to maintain a distance of at least 15 to 20 meters.

Speaker 2:
Around 20 meters, yes.

Speaker 1:
Alright. When you overtake, how much distance do you leave between your car and the car on your right before merging back into the lane?

Speaker 2:
When I turn left, it's about 5 meters. When I can see the front of the car in my rearview mirror, I know it's safe to merge back.

Speaker 1:
You mean you can see the headlights and part of the front of the car?

Speaker 2:
Yes, about half of the front. Then I signal and quickly merge back.

Speaker 1:
During the overtaking process, whether you're moving left or right, you quickly change lanes and then quickly steer back. Is that correct?

Speaker 2:
Yes, that's correct.

Speaker 1:
And when you're overtaking, do you accelerate gradually or do you press the gas pedal quickly?

Speaker 2:
I accelerate quickly, both the lane change and the acceleration are fast.

Speaker 1:
And then you decelerate after overtaking?

Speaker 2:
Yes, after overtaking, I decelerate. I don't always use the brakes; I just ease off the gas.

Speaker 1:
Understood. Let's watch the video. Is there anything missing?

Speaker 2:
Is there anything missing?

Speaker 1:
No, everything seems complete. We might ask you more questions after watching the video. For example, when you were making a right turn, was your view obstructed by the bushes, or could you see a little bit?

Speaker 2:
I could see through the bushes, but it was still difficult.

Speaker 1:
So, you checked your mirrors and quickly glanced to the left to ensure there was no one there, right?
**Speaker 1:**
So, at that moment, did you check your rearview mirror? You mentioned looking at the rearview mirror. Did you quickly glance to your left to check on that person?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I did.

**Speaker 1:**
You didn't let him pass, right?

**Speaker 1:**
That counts as overtaking, doesn't it?

**Speaker 2:**
Haha, yes.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright. To ensure the safety of this driving experiment, did you pay special attention to any particular areas while driving? Mainly, were you more focused on pedestrians, worried about hitting them? Besides that, did you pay extra attention to anything else compared to your usual driving?

**Speaker 2:**
I usually do pay attention.

**Speaker 1:**
But today, you were more attentive, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Maybe a bit more. But actually, it's about the same.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think there are any additional safety measures you could take based on today's driving experience? For instance, could you improve safety by slowing down even more at certain points?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, when I'm reversing, I could stop completely.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else? Not really? Okay. Can you recall any situations from your regular driving that you find particularly frightening? Like when a pedestrian suddenly appears out of nowhere. Did you encounter any similar situations today?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but not during the experiment, during the test drive.

**Speaker 1:**
You mean when that electric bike suddenly appeared?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes.

**Speaker 1:**
It came out of nowhere, right? I saw it before you did, but I didn't say anything because I wanted to see how quickly you would react.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, those situations are quite scary.

**Speaker 1:**
Luckily, it made a wide turn.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but it didn't slow down.

**Speaker 1:**
Right, it didn't slow down at all.

**Speaker 2:**
It was quite alarming.

**Speaker 1:**
It came out from that exit.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, probably from that exit.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think the non-motorized vehicle on your right was too close to you? Did you deliberately steer to the left to avoid it?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I did.

**Speaker 1:**
You were quite cautious, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I was.

**Speaker 1:**
You adjusted your steering quite early, didn't you? I noticed you were constantly steering to the left, making slight adjustments. After passing it, you slightly steered to the right to get back on track. Then you adjusted to the left again. Besides sudden pedestrian appearances, are there any other situations you find particularly scary?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, there are.
Speaker 1: I slightly pushed the pedal, and we returned to the lane. Just a bit to the left, no problem. Besides sudden pedestrian appearances, what other situations make you nervous while driving?

Speaker 2: Those kinds of...

Speaker 1: More complex roads? Like complicated intersections?

Speaker 2: No, not exactly. It's more like... you know, when the pedestrian, non-motorized, and motorized lanes are not clearly defined, so all kinds of vehicles are on the same road.

Speaker 1: All kinds of vehicles.

Speaker 2: Yes, and there are cars parked on both sides, making the road quite narrow.

Speaker 1: I understand what you mean.

Speaker 2: And sometimes...

Speaker 1: There might be cars parked illegally, taking up the non-motorized lane, and then non-motorized vehicles take up your lane. And at intersections, there are many pedestrians. Do you find these roads particularly scary? Any other situations that make you nervous?

Speaker 2: These roads are just more mentally exhausting, but not exactly scary.

Speaker 1: There are many things to watch out for.

Speaker 2: Yes, especially electric bikes. They often take up the motorized lanes or drive very fast.

Speaker 1: Alright, now we are approaching the first left turn of this experiment. Can you describe your driving habits when making a left turn? Is it completely opposite to making a right turn, or are there some differences?

Speaker 2: Not completely opposite, but there is a different order of yielding. It's a bit more complex but generally similar.

Speaker 1: Can you describe it in more detail? First, you observe the surroundings, right? At this point, you haven't started observing yet, like in the video.

Speaker 2: It depends on the road. On this kind of road, I would first look to the left to check for pedestrians. Once it's clear, I would move forward a bit to see the cars on the other side.

Speaker 1: Do you check the right side mirror or the right window first, or do you just not look to the right at all?

Speaker 2: I usually feel there are no cars on the right.

Speaker 1: But when you turn, you should at least glance at the right mirror, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, just a quick glance.

Speaker 1: And there's another left turn ahead. You might need to check more thoroughly here than the previous one.

Speaker 1: At this point, you must...

Speaker 1: Do you think you have any bad driving habits that could be dangerous? Like driving with one hand? Anything else? Speeding? Any other habits that could be dangerous?

Speaker 2: Maybe accelerating too quickly.

Speaker 1: Do situations like this make you nervous? What kind of situation is this?

Speaker 2: Is it when someone suddenly appears? Or when a cyclist suddenly turns left? I just saw someone turning left, almost hitting us.

Speaker 1: Slightly to the left.

Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: "And then it felt like he just turned left a moment ago. I don't know when, but I just saw it was Brother Wang managing, so it was almost..."

Speaker 2: "To the left, slightly."

Speaker 1: "Yes, I was afraid."

Speaker 2: "That he might suddenly ride to the left. Yes, yes, yes. Were you scared at that moment? Yes. Were you still scared after it happened? Were you worried that someone might suddenly appear in front of the car because the car was far away, similar to what you described as a 'ghost head' scenario?"

Speaker 1: "The scene."

Speaker 2: "It was quite close to the left."

Speaker 1: "Besides the bad habits you mentioned earlier, like driving with one hand, speeding, and stepping on the gas, are there any other bad driving habits you think could lead to danger?"

Speaker 2: "Listening to music."

Speaker 1: "Using the phone."

Speaker 2: "Yes, and also..."

Speaker 1: "At this moment, looking at the right rearview mirror is..."

Speaker 2: "The person? But he glanced at it. I don't remember. Sorry, I couldn't hold it in, hahaha. Maybe I was looking at that, hahaha. It's also a habit."

Speaker 1: "I wanted to remind you not to use your phone while driving because you could get caught."

Speaker 2: "I can see myself and my sister."

Speaker 1: "It's okay, we'll edit that out. Up ahead is a rather complex intersection, and it's intentionally designed for our experiment. It's an intersection without traffic lights. So we can focus on this intersection's situation. It might be similar to the complex scenarios you mentioned earlier. Why did you start turning right so early? Can I ask?"

Speaker 2: "Because that car was coming, and I was constantly checking the rearview mirror."

Speaker 1: "And after it passed?"

Speaker 2: "After it passed, I quickly turned because I was afraid another car might come."

Speaker 1: "Why did you turn without checking the left side again? You just started turning directly."

Speaker 2: "Did I think it was safe on the left?"

Speaker 1: "How did you determine it was safe on the left?"

Speaker 2: "I glanced with both eyes."

Speaker 1: "Actually, you were looking at the delivery guy, right? After he passed, you started turning. I was curious because if a car came from the left, you wouldn't have noticed."

Speaker 2: "From the left?"

Speaker 1: "A car coming straight from the left."

Speaker 2: "There was a car in front of me."

Speaker 1: "It would block the traffic for you."

Speaker 2: "Yes, so I just turned directly."

Speaker 1: "You could turn safely."

Speaker 2: "Yes, it wouldn't be a problem."

Speaker 1: "At that moment, did you check the rearview mirror again?"

Speaker 2: "I was checking if the car had a license plate and found it didn't."

Speaker 1: "When you're a passenger, what kind of driving behavior from others makes you feel uncomfortable?"
**Speaker 2:**
I was just checking if the car had a license plate and noticed it didn't.

**Speaker 1:**
When you're a passenger in someone else's car, what kind of driving makes you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**
Accelerating too quickly and braking too harshly.

**Speaker 1:**
Is there anything else? For example, do you observe the surroundings from the passenger seat?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it's mainly the aggressive use of the accelerator and brake that makes you feel unsafe. You don't get car sick, but I do. Do you get car sick?

**Speaker 2:**
I don't get car sick when I'm driving, but...

**Speaker 1:**
When you're a passenger?

**Speaker 2:**
It depends on how the driver is driving. Generally, I don't get car sick, but if the driver is constantly accelerating aggressively, that's when I might feel sick. Also, if I'm on a winding mountain road and playing on my phone, I might get car sick.

**Speaker 1:**
Okay, do you pay attention to the passengers' experience when you're driving? What aspects do you focus on?

**Speaker 2:**
I try not to brake too abruptly. Sometimes I might accelerate a bit more aggressively if there are no passengers, just to feel the rush.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you mean?

**Speaker 2:**
I mean, I might speed up.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you do it intentionally?

**Speaker 2:**
Only if the road conditions are good.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you might step on the gas to enjoy the speed?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but not excessively. It depends on the road conditions.

**Speaker 1:**
Besides that, what else do you consider for the passengers' comfort, like music or conversation?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, music and conversation.

**Speaker 1:**
What about turning? Do you consider how you turn the car?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but it doesn't really affect the passengers much. I can handle turns well, so it doesn't bother them.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think you have any bad driving habits that might make passengers uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Using my phone while driving, haha.

**Speaker 1:**
Why does that make them uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Because it's distracting, haha.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really. What did I mention earlier?

**Speaker 1:**
You talked about safety concerns. This is more about comfort. What are your usual driving habits?

**Speaker 2:**
I drive very steadily. People often compliment my driving because it's smoother compared to others my age.

**Speaker 1:**
So, they think you drive very steadily?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, they do. Using my phone might cause them some stress, but I usually avoid it when I have passengers.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, and when you're a passenger...
**Speaker 1:**
I feel like I drive very steadily. So, playing with my phone might cause some psychological pressure on them, but I generally understand myself when I'm driving with passengers.

**Speaker 2:**
Hmm, so when you usually ride in someone else's car, do you feel unsafe? What kind of driving makes you uncomfortable? Is it related to safety?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, so is your discomfort tied to feeling unsafe, or is it that feeling unsafe makes you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Discomfort doesn't necessarily mean unsafe.

**Speaker 1:**
What kind of situations make you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
For example, when a pedestrian suddenly appears, and the driver has to slam on the brakes.

**Speaker 1:**
I see, so sometimes the driver has to perform certain maneuvers to ensure safety, even if it might be uncomfortable.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, some people are hesitant to brake hard.

**Speaker 1:**
So, if they don't brake hard enough...

**Speaker 2:**
Or if they brake too gently, it can be more dangerous. Some people are afraid of making the ride uncomfortable, so they don't brake hard enough, which can lead to accidents.

**Speaker 1:**
So, if a driver brakes very hard, you might actually feel safer?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I feel that...

**Speaker 1:**
If they brake hard when necessary, it's okay.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it's okay. It shows that I can trust them. Generally, experienced drivers don't need to brake hard often. But if they hesitate to brake hard in critical situations, it makes me feel uneasy.

**Speaker 1:**
It's like during a test drive, if an electric car suddenly appears and you don't brake hard, I would feel very unsafe. Even if you could avoid the car by steering to the right, you should still brake to ensure safety. After that, I would feel more secure and reassured.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, you need to brake hard when necessary.

**Speaker 1:**
But braking hard can be uncomfortable.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it can be uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
Understood. Did you notice any sudden stops today?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I did.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you know?

**Speaker 2:**
I saw it. It happened during the trip.

**Speaker 1:**
Okay, we will show you the data from the passenger's handle. We will try to find the moments when they pressed it and correlate it with your driving. Would you like to see where they pressed the handle?

**Speaker 2:**
Sure.

**Speaker 1:**
Considering passenger comfort, did you pay special attention to any aspects of your driving today? Did you do anything to make the ride more comfortable, knowing they might press the handle?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really. I just drove normally. I didn't pay special attention to comfort today.
Speaker 2:
No, not really. I think everything was normal. I didn't feel anything unusual.

Speaker 1:
So, you didn't particularly focus on the comfort of the city driving today?

Speaker 2:
No, my main concern was that he was sitting there, so I paid attention to that, but I didn't mention it.

Speaker 1:
It wasn't related to the experiment, right?

Speaker 2:
No, it wasn't about the handle. Otherwise, I think the experiment results wouldn't have been very accurate.

Speaker 1:
So, because he was sitting there, you paid special attention to certain aspects?

Speaker 2:
Yes, mainly the brakes and the accelerator. I tend to get car sick, so if the brakes or accelerator are used too abruptly, it makes me uncomfortable.

Speaker 1:
Today, the braking was smoother compared to usual, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, but I also...

Speaker 1:
You also...

Speaker 2:
I also feel uncomfortable, so I try to drive smoothly. Many people say I drive steadily because I brake very gently. I think that's it. Other than that, there's nothing much. When I drive, I take turns slowly. I think the only thing I do differently is that I sometimes use my phone while driving, but otherwise, everything is pretty much the same.

Speaker 1:
So, how do you think you can make the driving experience more comfortable for passengers? Based on your driving today, what additional efforts or improvements can you make?

Speaker 2:
I think I still pressed the accelerator twice.

Speaker 1:
So, you mean you shouldn't have accelerated twice? You should have driven slowly in a straight line and then gradually sped up when merging onto the main road?

Speaker 2:
Yes, driving steadily, taking turns and U-turns slowly, and accelerating gently when exiting.

Speaker 1:
The next few questions might be a bit difficult to answer. The first question is, what do you think makes a good driver or a professional driver? Let me finish this part first, then I'll ask you the next question. This is about judging if there's a condition to overtake on the left.

Speaker 2:
I saw a car behind, so I prepared to overtake.

Speaker 1:
Did you overtake two cars in a row?

Speaker 2:
I wanted to, but I wasn't sure where to do it. I thought it was here, but then I felt it was too late, so I...

Speaker 1:
So you hesitated?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I hesitated and realized it wasn't the right spot.

Speaker 1:
So you waited and didn't overtake?

Speaker 2:
Yes, because there were only 300 meters left to overtake.

Speaker 1:
Back to my previous question, what do you think makes a good driver or a professional driver?

Speaker 2:
First and foremost, the driver should make the ride comfortable.

Speaker 1:
Comfort is the most important?

Speaker 2:
Yes, comfort is primary. Of course, safety is crucial, but as a passenger, your experience is more about comfort.
Comfort is paramount, but you can't say that safety isn't the most important thing. However, as a passenger, when you experience it...

Speaker 1:
You might not feel that safety is as crucial.

Speaker 2:
Safety is important, but it doesn't always come into play. For example, if a pedestrian suddenly appears out of nowhere and the driver calmly brakes or maneuvers around them, the passenger would think, "Not bad, safety is definitely the most important." This is something a driver must possess. But to be a good driver, first and foremost, the ride must be comfortable. Secondly, and indeed most importantly, the driver must have the experience to calmly handle unexpected situations. They might drive smoothly all day without needing to brake suddenly, but if a dangerous situation arises, they must be able to brake or accelerate to navigate through it. This is what I consider a qualified driver. Also...

Speaker 1:
Personal hygiene.

Speaker 2:
Yes, a bit of a smell can be off-putting.

Speaker 1:
Haha, anything else? Professional drivers, politeness.

Speaker 2:
Professional drivers, the ones you hire, shouldn't take detours.

Speaker 1:
Just basic etiquette, right? So, what do you think is the biggest difference between experienced and new drivers?

Speaker 2:
If I had to point out one thing...

Speaker 1:
You can mention several, it's okay.

Speaker 2:
In everyday driving, there are things like... people often say...

Speaker 1:
Hesitating.

Speaker 2:
Yes, hesitating. For example, if you're unsure and other cars just pass you by. Or driving very slowly, like going 40 in an 80 zone, not keeping up with traffic, being afraid to drive or reverse, not judging distances well, possibly causing accidents or missing opportunities to go. This is everyday driving. And then there's...

Speaker 1:
Like mixing up the gas and brake pedals, not knowing what to do in sudden situations, covering their eyes.

Speaker 1:
The next question might be harder to answer, take your time. In what ways do you think autonomous cars will never be able to match human drivers?

Speaker 1:
It's a red light, we can stop here. Oh, I didn't see you...

Speaker 2:
You saw me looking at the auto...

Speaker 1:
I didn't see your car moving forward at all.

Speaker 2:
Yes, it's synchronized. Then I braked, and the car moved forward again. Did you see that?

Speaker 1:
No, it wasn't obvious. The camera was shaking too. Then you braked again.
Speaker 1: Hey, did you see that green car ahead? It just moved forward. Did you notice?

Speaker 2: No, I didn't see it clearly. It wasn't obvious because the camera was shaking. Then I had to brake again.

Speaker 1: I noticed you were looking at the auto hold button. Were you trying to press it?

Speaker 2: Yes, I was. But let's get back to the question. Autonomous cars can never fully replicate human driving.

Speaker 1: Why do you think that is?

Speaker 2: Technologically, autonomous driving is definitely more convenient. However, it lacks the human touch. For instance, in certain situations, a human driver might make a compassionate choice. For example, in an emergency, a human might help others.

Speaker 1: Can you give an example?

Speaker 2: Sure. If you're close to making a U-turn, you might honk to signal the car in front to let you through. But if both cars are autonomous, they might just stay put.

Speaker 1: So, you're saying there's a lack of human interaction?

Speaker 2: Exactly. Human drivers often help each other on the road. But with autonomous cars, everyone follows the rules strictly, which might not be ideal in urgent situations.

Speaker 1: Like if an ambulance needs to get through a traffic jam, an autonomous car might not yield as efficiently as a human driver would.

Speaker 2: Right. If the light is red and an ambulance is behind, a human driver might switch to manual mode to let it pass. An autonomous car might not do that unless programmed specifically.

Speaker 1: So, in such cases, you'd have to take control manually to help out.

Speaker 2: Yes, exactly. Autonomous driving systems might not handle these nuanced situations well.

Speaker 1: Are there any other areas where autonomous driving falls short?

Speaker 2: Not really. The main issue is the lack of human empathy. Otherwise, machines are generally more precise than humans, especially when drivers are tired.

Speaker 1: Moving on, how do you judge the intentions of pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles while driving? Let's start with pedestrians.

Speaker 2: It's quite simple. Pedestrians use crosswalks to cross the street and walk on sidewalks. If they jaywalk, you can usually tell by their body language.
**Speaker 2:**
It's quite simple. Pedestrians walk on the crosswalk to cross the street and use the sidewalk to walk along the road. If they jaywalk, even though they are not following the rules, they are still crossing the street.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you determine if they will stop for you or continue walking?

**Speaker 2:**
I usually stop first and observe their reaction.

**Speaker 1:**
What if they also stop?

**Speaker 2:**
Then we both stop. I wait a bit longer. If I feel like going, I might just go. The most annoying thing is the hesitation. If you want to go first, just press the gas pedal, and they will know you are going. Or you can wait until they pass and then go. You can't just keep waiting indefinitely.

**Speaker 1:**
But what if you both stop and then both start walking at the same time, and then both stop again?

**Speaker 2:**
I use hand signals. I usually gesture to let them know they can go first.

**Speaker 1:**
Can I ask how you usually make these gestures? Does it depend on the direction they are walking? For example, if they are walking from left to right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, if they are walking from left to right, I gesture in that direction.

**Speaker 1:**
So you change the direction of your gesture based on their movement?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. If I see them moving in a certain direction, I gesture accordingly.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you focus on any specific part of their body to judge their direction, like their legs or face?

**Speaker 2:**
I usually look at their legs. It's quite obvious from their legs.

**Speaker 1:**
You think the legs are the most obvious?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but I also consider the direction their body is facing.

**Speaker 1:**
So you don't just look at their legs?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I also look at their face and body orientation.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you make eye contact with them?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I do. I look at their face to see which direction they are heading. If we both stop and they stay still, I will go. If they don't look at me and keep walking, I will stop to avoid an accident.

**Speaker 1:**
So if they don't acknowledge you and keep walking, you will stop?

**Speaker 2:**
Of course. I don't want to risk hitting them.
Speaker 1:
What if the pedestrian doesn't see you and keeps walking forward?

Speaker 2:
In that case, I would definitely stop. You have to be cautious.

Speaker 1:
Really?

Speaker 2:
Of course. If I hit someone, I would be responsible. If they don't see me, I have to stop.

Speaker 1:
But sometimes, if you judge that you can safely pass, you might not stop, right?

Speaker 2:
No, I would still yield. They are pedestrians, and if they keep walking without noticing me, I have to be careful.

Speaker 1:
So, if the pedestrian is far away, you would just go ahead, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, if there's enough distance and we won't intersect, I would proceed. But if I'm scared and they aren't paying attention, I would stop.

Speaker 1:
How do you judge the intentions of non-motorized vehicles?

Speaker 2:
It depends on the weather, the type of vehicle, and where they are heading. If they are beside me, I might be more cautious.

Speaker 1:
Even if they are on your right, they might suddenly turn left in front of you.

Speaker 2:
If they do that, it's their responsibility. I can't control their actions.

Speaker 1:
So, you don't try to predict the intentions of non-motorized vehicles, you just keep your distance?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I try to maintain a safe distance. At intersections, I yield when necessary. If they suddenly swerve into my path while I'm driving normally, there's nothing I can do. I don't assume they will cut in front of me because I can usually react faster. Non-motorized vehicles also have turn signals, so they can't just suddenly cut in front of me without any indication.

Speaker 1:
But what if they weave between cars frequently?

Speaker 2:
In such cases, we would definitely stop.

Speaker 1:
So, you would stop if you feel they might hit your car?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I would stop because I don't want them to scratch my car. But if we are moving, they usually don't dare to weave in and out like that.

Speaker 1:
Non-motorized vehicles are indeed a significant hazard. For example, during test drives, they can be unpredictable.

Speaker 2:
Yes, that's why we have to be careful.

Speaker 1:
You never know if they will slow down or not, and they often don't use turn signals when turning.

Speaker 2:
Exactly. That's why speeding is dangerous because you can't react in time.

Speaker 1:
So, you find it too difficult to predict the intentions of non-motorized vehicles?

Speaker 2:
Yes, it's very challenging, so I don't try to predict their actions.

Speaker 1:
You don't have a process for anticipating their moves?

Speaker 2:
Not really.
Speaker 1: You completely give up on judging this situation.

Speaker 2: Yes, I saw it. In reverse.

Speaker 1: So, you don't have a process of anticipation. Do you think you can anticipate?

Speaker 2: For example, at an intersection, I wonder if a car might suddenly rush out, so I slow down at intersections. Does that count?

Speaker 1: That doesn't count. How do you judge the intentions of motor vehicles? Besides indicators like turn signals and brake lights, can you tell which lane they are going to take, whether they are going to turn left or right?

Speaker 2: By looking at their speed and lane choice.

Speaker 1: If the car is in the lane right in front of you, how do you judge if it wants to overtake or slow down? Does it have brake lights? Or has it already started to decelerate without braking? Sometimes, a car might decelerate without using the brake, so there won't be any brake lights. If it suddenly wants to turn left or right without signaling, the car behind has no information.

Speaker 2: That's why I usually keep a safe distance.

Speaker 1: So, when observing the car in front, besides obvious signals like lights, do you observe anything else?

Speaker 2: I generally keep a safe distance.

Speaker 1: To give yourself enough reaction time?

Speaker 2: Yes, exactly. If there's a traffic jam, I stay closer, but when driving fast, I keep a greater distance.

Speaker 1: Lastly, about making a U-turn, this is my final question. Imagine a scenario at an intersection without traffic lights, with pedestrians or non-motorized vehicles crossing. How do you judge if they will yield to you or not?

Speaker 2: I don't judge; I just let them go.

Speaker 1: So, you completely give up on judging whether they will yield to you?

Speaker 2: Yes, I wait until they have passed before I proceed.

Speaker 1: Do you signal to these vehicles?

Speaker 2: No, because they usually just go once they see me stop. They don't signal back.

Speaker 1: They see you stop and just ride away because it's too much effort for them to communicate with you.

Speaker 2: Yes, they have to stop their vehicle, turn around, and signal, which is a lot of steps. It's different from me sitting in the car and observing pedestrians. So, they usually just ride away when they see me stop.

Speaker 1: After making the U-turn, you mentioned non-motorized vehicles cutting in from your right to your front. This seems quite common.

Speaker 2: Yes, it usually happens at low speeds; otherwise, they wouldn't have the chance to cut in front of a car.
Speaker 1: I think it's quite common. Yes, this kind of situation can happen.

Speaker 2: Usually, the speed is very low for them to have such an opportunity. Otherwise, how could they suddenly cut in from behind into the car lane?

Speaker 1: Exactly.

Speaker 2: In such cases, the car's speed is also not very high.

Speaker 1: Sometimes, for example, they might be rushing to beat a red light, but the light in front of the car has already turned green. They are in your blind spot, and you don't see them. As you start to move, they come from the right side, causing confusion.

Speaker 2: Unless...

Speaker 1: We've encountered this during experiments. They make a left turn without waiting for the light to change or for pedestrians to cross. They don't pay attention to traffic lights or pedestrian signals. Eventually, they might not even notice the lights at all.

Speaker 1: Check the data from the wristband, not the handle. Dolly told me the approximate time. The video started at 3:32. It's a bit much, I'm hungry.

Speaker 2: How many are there?

Speaker 1: About 200, I think. Enjoy. Their interview is in the next room. Why don't we...

Speaker 2: Why not interview together?

Speaker 1: Good question. Can we compare notes? I once suggested this idea, but it was rejected.

Speaker 2: I did it once, but mutual responses can affect the outcome. Okay, 36 minutes.

Speaker 1: 21:30. I have 36 minutes here.

Speaker 2: 20:32 start.

Speaker 1: Add 36?

Speaker 2: Yes, 4 minutes 20, 21 onwards.

Speaker 1: 4 minutes 21 onwards.

Speaker 2: At the beginning, there was a bug, and we were pressing the button for a minute.

Speaker 1: We can only pinpoint it to the minute, not the exact second. I'll press it again. The start time was 3:32, but it's not precise to the second.

Speaker 2: But what about Yi Yao? Didn't he say you could press it whenever you felt uncomfortable? So, it might not be related to me. For example, he might see a car getting too close from the passenger seat and press the button. It doesn't necessarily mean you slammed the brakes or something. Also, 36...

Speaker 1: Not 397 minutes, 21. After 21.

Speaker 2: Twenty-something.

Speaker 1: After 30. A delivery truck, right? At this time.

Speaker 2: It must be this.

Speaker 1: And then there are many people asking questions. If they don't ask, I will. They will specifically pick out uncomfortable moments from the passenger's perspective.

Speaker 2: January 34.

Speaker 1: 50 minutes 14. This is very similar to the situation where they cut in.

Speaker 2: Moon.

Speaker 1: At this time, indeed.

Speaker 2: Then it can only be that.

Speaker 1: It could also be a non-motorized vehicle on the right, and you overtook it.
Speaker 2: The situation was quite tight.

Speaker 1: Indeed, at that moment.

Speaker 2: So, we had no choice but to proceed.

Speaker 1: It’s possible that there was a non-motorized vehicle on the right, and you were overtaking within that minute, right?

Speaker 1: You must have braked hard.

Speaker 1: After about 50 seconds, there was one last time, right? You said this section might be on the left, or maybe the left rear? It was the left rear.

Speaker 2: Were they in the same frame? Not sure which side.

Speaker 1: It might have been on the left. I honked twice. The left side was really close, but it was indeed on the left.

Speaker 2: This section was very narrow. Yes, he let me pass, so I honked twice to thank him.

Speaker 1: Is that so?

Speaker 2: After I had passed.

Speaker 1: There was no network, so I didn’t honk more. It was continuous honking.

Speaker 2: No, it was spaced out, roughly.

Speaker 1: It covered almost every minute, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, I honked once every minute.

Speaker 1: I saw it honking every minute, which was quite awkward.

Speaker 2: Did you honk for 5 minutes straight?

Speaker 1: Okay, what about this?

Speaker 2: Let me fill this in for you, it’s almost done.

Speaker 1: Right, I’ll compare it for you. You can check it on your phone first. Do you remember the escort?

Speaker 2: Can’t you just use WeChat directly?

Speaker 1: No, I can’t. I’m not the one paying, how can I give you the WeChat of the live broadcast room?

Speaker 2: How do you know the bank branch?

Speaker 1: We will check the data quality.

Speaker 2: How do you know the bank branch?

Speaker 1: I heard it as "how do you know the bank is not good."

Speaker 2: So, it’s all 400, but the quality is very good.

Speaker 1: Professional drivers can get 800, those who can lead the driving.

Speaker 2: It used to be 800.

Speaker 1: Now, let me take a call. The earliest batch? Yes, hello, how do you see the villa by the lake?

Speaker 2: Look?

Speaker 2: Okay, also, ChatGPT, help me write the MR.

Speaker 1: Alright, I’ll take you down, you can go directly.

Speaker 2: To B1? No, it’s still the same, you see, I’m not good.

Speaker 1: Where to? You don’t know behind you.

Speaker 2: He has to go home. You need to go home, I need to find someone.

Speaker 2: Let me share something with you.

Speaker 2: You know, on my first day, I was very nervous. My mom told me to dress formally, so I wore a suit, not a...

Speaker 2: Suit, but like a...

Speaker 2: Wore a button-up shirt, something like that, and even wore a jacket. For the first few weeks, I insisted on dressing a bit more formally.

Speaker 2: Me too. On my first day, I saw them, and by the second day, I felt it was too stuffy. In Guangdong, wearing Crocs is very normal. Yes, everyone wears them, just like slippers. I bought them too.

Speaker 2: And skin brings...

Speaker 2: But I only wear them to wash my feet, I wouldn’t wear them out. They wear out quickly, but if you come to Guangdong, it’s not a concern.
Speaker 2: But I bought them just to wear at home, not to go out. They are comfortable, but if you come to Guangzhou, you won't need to worry about it. 

Speaker 2: My middle school was in Shenzhen. Whenever it rained, you wouldn't see anyone wearing other shoes. 

Speaker 1: It's been a long time since I introduced this point.

Speaker 2: We are almost there, we are almost at 6, and I have 27 more. Yes, we finish work at 7:20.

Speaker 2: The original design was for rainy days or the beach. It was for people who work on boats because they can float, so if you lose them, you can find them. They are also easy to clean because they have holes, so even if they get wet, it doesn't matter.

Speaker 2: Structurally, they are part of the fashion system. Do they really look good? I don't know, I've never seen them. I haven't seen them in person, but have you seen pictures of the black ones? Hmm, how easy, yeah, look at these. I don't quite understand the appeal. Do you know that? That photo shoot was super true. Oh, I know, isn't it super cute? Yes, and I saw someone wearing them on a treadmill. That's reassuring.

Speaker 2: He got them for 500 or 600, which is okay. I thought they would cost thousands.

Speaker 2: How they sell looks reasonable.

Speaker 2: It looks unintentional, but it is intentional. Is it really intentional? Yes, it is. I've seen some like this.

Speaker 2: Total funders and I were the normal question. Around 500, three or four.

Speaker 2: Hmm, I know I didn't do this. He is very skilled. You might hear that. I said I wasn't there. Maybe I need to go over it again. I turned around, and I was gone. And my anchor.

Speaker 2: What I try to do is because they say you have tech, you go to this room. I had my text, I mean one here and one here, and a lot of those were stickers. No, I thought these were stickers in different.

Speaker 2: There's a six. Hahaha, so kind. I think you only have one. Yes, they lose easily, I had several days. Didn't you have it fixed? Once, one year after?

Speaker 2: What?

Speaker 2: Do you guys need? They still don't like actual Tinder. Wow, she plays Tina. Very not.

Speaker 2: Ben will show you are the first one I matched. I think, yeah, I think you would.

Speaker 2: It really takes one of the first like you, but dating is where the ones work once lucky you try it multiple.

Speaker 2: Kinds that never work. A dating app, but more romantic hustle. I wish I thought it would be too, but then.

Speaker 2: I didn't expect to talk to him.

Speaker 2: Does he need to do homework? Yes.
