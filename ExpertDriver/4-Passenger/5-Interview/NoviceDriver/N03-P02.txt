**Speaker 1:**
Let's get started. I'll begin by asking you a few questions. Do you often travel by car?

**Speaker 2:**
Not every day, but I do travel by car at least once a week.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you usually take longer trips or shorter ones? If it's a short trip, how long does it typically last?

**Speaker 2:**
Usually around 20 to 30 minutes.

**Speaker 1:**
So, for city trips, it's about 20 to 30 minutes. How did you feel about your experience in our vehicle this time? What was it like?

**Speaker 2:**
The acceleration was quite strong, giving a noticeable push-back feeling, similar to a taxi. It might be due to the way the driver was driving.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think about the driver's skills?

**Speaker 2:**
They were really good, quite like a taxi driver.

**Speaker 1:**
But it felt a bit fast, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the acceleration was quite noticeable.

**Speaker 1:**
If you had to choose, what type of car would you prefer to travel in? For example, an SUV, an electric car, or a gasoline car?

**Speaker 2:**
I'm fine with any type. Usually, I just take whatever car is available when I call a taxi.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you don't have any specific preferences? Do you drive yourself? How do you think you drive?

**Speaker 2:**
I'm quite a cautious driver. I tend to follow the rules strictly.

**Speaker 1:**
In what ways are you cautious? What do you pay more attention to?

**Speaker 2:**
For example, I keep a safe distance from the car in front of me. I also accelerate gradually and avoid sudden speed increases. When waiting at a red light, I don't rush to move as soon as it turns green.

**Speaker 1:**
You follow traffic rules.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, and if someone tries to cut in, I usually let them.

**Speaker 1:**
Haha, I wouldn't argue with them either.

**Speaker 1:**
Now, let's review the route you just took. If there were any memorable points, feel free to mention them.

**Speaker 2:**
I remember a couple of places. Can I pinpoint them directly? Haha, just the two places I mentioned earlier.

**Speaker 1:**
I appreciate passengers like you.

**Speaker 2:**
I have some impressions of the later parts of the route as well.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about the turns?

**Speaker 2:**
Nothing major, just pressed the button twice, right?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, mention those two times, and the rest seemed fine. I'll ask you more questions as we go along. Are you familiar with this route?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, quite familiar. We did some experiments in this area before, around Dongguan City and the northern parts.
**Speaker 1:** The road was quite smooth, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, very familiar. We just went to those small projects. We've done experiments there before. It's in the northern part of Dongguan City.

**Speaker 1:** Were there any issues with this place?

**Speaker 2:** Everything seemed fine today, quite normal, nothing special.

**Speaker 2:** I did notice there were a lot of cars.

**Speaker 1:** But did you feel anything when you saw so many cars?

**Speaker 2:** Not really, it felt normal. The first time, I had to move forward a bit more when he made a U-turn.

**Speaker 1:** When that small car rushed by, did you feel anything?

**Speaker 1:** And what about the cars overtaking us?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't really notice much. There was a spot ahead where he stopped, or rather, he was about to make a U-turn. I remember he braked quite suddenly.

**Speaker 1:** Was it a sudden brake?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it was. It wasn't exactly an emergency stop, but the acceleration changed quite abruptly.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about that?

**Speaker 2:** It felt like a pushback. It should be called sudden braking, causing a forward tilt.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Not really uncomfortable, just a bit of a jolt.

**Speaker 1:** So, he made a U-turn here?

**Speaker 2:** Not exactly at the U-turn, but he decelerated quickly before making the turn.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think that's normal?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it's normal. Many drivers do that. It's just a matter of personal driving habits.

**Speaker 2:** Overall, there were no major issues. He drove quite fast but steady.

**Speaker 1:** Fast and steady?

**Speaker 2:** Yes. The driver was supposed to drive for 20-30 minutes, but he finished in 17 minutes. He drove very fast.

**Speaker 1:** He might be a taxi driver, driving every day.

**Speaker 2:** I didn't feel much, except when he made a right turn at the intersection. He turned quickly without slowing down much.

**Speaker 1:** Was the braking sudden there?

**Speaker 2:** Not really.

**Speaker 1:** So, overall, you felt fine except for those two instances?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, everything else was fine. I remember now, we turned left near a primary school.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel when the big truck came by?

**Speaker 2:** Nothing special. He drove normally here. The road was just a bit narrow.

**Speaker 1:** Besides the driver's skills, how did you feel personally?
**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about the driving in this area? Was everything normal, or did you notice anything unusual?

**Speaker 2:** The driving seemed pretty normal here. The only thing is that the roads felt a bit narrow.

**Speaker 1:** Besides the driver's skills, did you personally feel any discomfort during the ride?

**Speaker 2:** Not really. The ride itself was fine. But, did you see that turn just now? The driver took it quite sharply and braked suddenly. The speed was a bit high, and then they had to steer quickly.

**Speaker 1:** So, the driver braked suddenly?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, the speed dropped quickly, and I was pushed forward. At the same time, the driver had to steer to the right, which made it a bit uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Not exactly uncomfortable, but I did feel it.

**Speaker 1:** So, you felt something.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, if I were on my phone, it might have been more noticeable. People who get car sick might find it annoying.

**Speaker 1:** Do you get car sick?

**Speaker 2:** I don't, but my mom does. When my dad drives, she feels sick, especially during sudden stops, accelerations, and sharp turns.

**Speaker 1:** Especially if you're on your phone, it can make you feel dizzy.

**Speaker 2:** I don't get dizzy from using my phone, not at all. I don't know why.

**Speaker 1:** Did you encounter any pedestrians crossing the road?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, just now there was a pedestrian crossing, and the driver slowed down to let them pass. If there were no pedestrians, the driver might not have slowed down as much. But everything seemed normal here.

**Speaker 1:** Were there any bumps on the road?

**Speaker 2:** Nothing out of the ordinary, just normal bumps that are acceptable.

**Speaker 1:** Sometimes it's because of the road conditions.

**Speaker 2:** I didn't really notice any significant bumps.

**Speaker 1:** Besides the sudden braking you mentioned, did you notice any other dangerous maneuvers by the driver?

**Speaker 2:** I wasn't paying close attention to the driver, so I didn't notice anything else.

**Speaker 1:** If there were any, you would have felt it, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I think so. If there were any dangerous maneuvers, I would have noticed.

**Speaker 1:** In your opinion, what constitutes safe driving behavior in everyday life?

**Speaker 2:** Don't rush or cut in front of others. Just follow the traffic rules and drive according to the regulations. For example, when changing lanes...
**Speaker 1:** In your daily life, how do you approach driving?

**Speaker 2:** I try not to rush or cut in line. I follow traffic rules. For example, if the light is about to turn green, I get ready and accelerate quickly to avoid slowing down traffic. On the other hand, if the light is about to turn red, I don't speed up to beat it because that can be dangerous.

**Speaker 1:** You mean when the light is about to turn red, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:** When you're a passenger in someone else's car, what kind of driver behavior makes you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:** If the driver mounts a phone next to them and keeps checking it for new orders or messages while driving, that makes me feel unsafe.

**Speaker 1:** Checking their phone while driving?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, using their phone while driving makes me feel uneasy.

**Speaker 1:** Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** Whenever I see a driver using their phone while driving, it makes me anxious.

**Speaker 1:** So that's the main thing you pay attention to?

**Speaker 2:** I don't mind if they look at a map, but using the phone for other things or chatting on the phone while driving makes me worried. Even if they seem skilled, it still concerns me.

**Speaker 1:** So if you trust the driver, does that make a difference? How do you decide if you trust a driver?

**Speaker 2:** Most taxi drivers are okay unless they seem really distracted. For example, if a driver checks their phone at every red light, that bothers me. It's rare, but it happens sometimes.

**Speaker 1:** Do you mind if the driver is emotional?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, if the driver has big mood swings, it bothers me. For instance, if they are arguing with someone while driving, I worry they might drive recklessly. I would tell them to calm down because I value my safety.

**Speaker 1:** Most people would probably choose to stay quiet in such situations because they might be scared of the driver.

**Speaker 2:** I would speak up.

**Speaker 1:** How do you define safety in driving?

**Speaker 2:** Safety means following traffic rules. My driving habits are influenced by my experience and personality.

**Speaker 1:** It's clear that you take safety very seriously.

**Speaker 2:** Yes.
**Speaker 1:**
So, you mentioned that you strictly follow the driving rules. Does your driving experience relate to your personality?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, definitely. My driving style is very cautious. For example, I never drive when I'm tired. If I feel sleepy, I either take a break or drink a Red Bull.

**Speaker 1:**
It seems like you are very careful.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, for instance, during the May Day holiday when driving on the highway, we take turns driving. If anyone feels even slightly tired or needs to use the restroom, we switch drivers or drink Red Bull.

**Speaker 1:**
Does Red Bull help? Does it keep you alert?

**Speaker 2:**
It works if you drink it in advance, about half an hour before you start feeling tired. Drinking it immediately doesn't help much.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think today's driver is experienced? We talked about this before. Do you consider yourself a novice or an experienced driver?

**Speaker 2:**
I wouldn't say I'm a novice, but I'm not a veteran either. I'm somewhere in between.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think is the main difference between a novice driver and an experienced one?

**Speaker 2:**
Novice drivers tend to drive slower and accelerate more gradually. Their overall speed is usually lower.

**Speaker 1:**
Are novice drivers more cautious than experienced ones?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, novice drivers are generally more cautious and drive slower. Some people might find them too slow and impatient.

**Speaker 1:**
When you become an experienced driver, do you think you'll be less cautious?

**Speaker 2:**
I don't think so. It depends on one's personality. I believe I'll still drive cautiously, though I might drive a bit faster.

**Speaker 1:**
But still within a controllable range, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. I'm always worried about accidents and the trouble they bring.

**Speaker 1:**
How would you rate your experience with today's driver on a scale of 1 to 10?

**Speaker 2:**
I'd give it a 7.

**Speaker 1:**
What factors made you deduct those 3 points?

**Speaker 2:**
Compared to my own driving, it wasn't perfectly smooth. There were some rapid accelerations and decelerations. It's not that it was uncomfortable, just different from my driving habits. But I can't expect everyone to drive like me. The driver was fast, which is good if I'm in a hurry.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you care about the driver's time management when you're in a hurry?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it depends on whether I'm in a rush. If I am, I appreciate a fast driver. If not, it doesn't matter much to me.

**Speaker 1:**
Did the driver do anything that made you uncomfortable today?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really, everything was fine.
**Speaker 1:**
I'm not in a hurry, it doesn't matter to me. How was the driver's performance today? Any uncomfortable maneuvers?

**Speaker 2:**
It seemed like there weren't any. I'm not sure if he used the turn signals properly. I didn't pay much attention because I was a bit annoyed by the sound. I heard the signal sound from the back, but I'm not sure if he used it in the front. I always use the turn signals, even on small roads with no traffic, when turning left or right. But it seems like he might not have used them in the front. We're not very sure about that.

**Speaker 1:**
When you're a passenger in someone else's car, are there any behaviors from others that make you uncomfortable? This includes other passengers, the driver, or even pedestrians.

**Speaker 2:**
I particularly dislike it when pedestrians don't follow traffic rules, like when they rush to cross the zebra crossing without following the signals. It's really annoying.

**Speaker 1:**
Does this happen often?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, quite often. As a driver, I like to have occasional conversations, especially during long highway drives which can be tiring. I want someone to chat with me a bit.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you prefer this as a driver or as a passenger?

**Speaker 2:**
As a driver, I really appreciate it when the person in the passenger seat chats with me a bit. However, I don't like it when they play loud music or do things that can be distracting. Just normal conversation is fine, without too much noise.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think makes a driver professional? What are the essential aspects they need to cover?

**Speaker 2:**
A professional driver, like those from ride-hailing services, usually wears a mask and gloves throughout the ride. They greet you politely and ask for permission before making or taking calls. They maintain a high level of courtesy.

**Speaker 1:**
Are there any specific behaviors during the drive that you consider important, aside from the pre-drive preparations?

**Speaker 2:**
During the drive, I think it's important for the ride to be smooth. When I book a ride-hailing service, the ride is usually smoother compared to regular taxis, which can sometimes be jerky due to the way they drive.

**Speaker 1:**
What about your definition of comfort?

**Speaker 2:**
Comfort includes both the ride quality and the interior environment of the car.

**Speaker 1:**
What kind of interior environment do you prefer?

**Speaker 2:**
I prefer a spacious, bright, and clean interior. Some ride-hailing services provide essentials like tissues, which is a nice touch.
**Speaker 1:** The interior of this car is quite spacious, making it feel bright and clean. Sometimes, there are essential items like tissues or even bottled water provided by the driver, which enhances the comfort level. In contrast, taxis might feel a bit dirtier, and you can immediately sense the difference when you sit down.

**Speaker 2:** So, you're talking about the comfort of the ride, right? Yes, the comfort level is definitely related to the car's interior. But besides the interior environment, there are other factors too.

**Speaker 1:** Like the way the driver handles the car?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:** How smooth the driver is. Do you think today's ride was driven by a human or was it autonomous?

**Speaker 2:** I think it was driven by a human. Was it autonomous?

**Speaker 1:** Let's talk about it, haha. Why do you think so?

**Speaker 2:** I feel that autonomous driving tends to be more cautious and smooth. If a human is driving, there might be sudden accelerations or sharp turns, which can make some people feel nauseous.

**Speaker 1:** So, today's ride wasn't as smooth as autonomous driving would be.

**Speaker 2:** Right. In my experience, autonomous driving tends to be more consistent because it aims to meet the needs of most people. I haven't experienced autonomous driving myself, but I imagine it would be smoother.

**Speaker 1:** That's a common expectation.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because some people get car sick from sudden movements.

**Speaker 1:** What aspects do you think autonomous cars can't handle as well as human drivers?

**Speaker 2:** As I mentioned earlier, in unexpected situations, like when there's interference from stray light that the system might mistake for a lane marking, leading to potential accidents. A human would need to intervene in such cases.

**Speaker 1:** You're referring to that news story, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes. However, on city roads, it seems to work fine unless there's a malfunction. But if I were to ride in an autonomous car, I'd still feel a bit challenged. I've never tried it before.

**Speaker 1:** What concerns you about it?

**Speaker 2:** Its safety. If autonomous cars were widespread and had been in use for several years, I'd feel more confident. But right now, it's still in the trial phase.

**Speaker 1:** So, you have some reservations.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, a bit.

**Speaker 1:** Were you worried today?

**Speaker 2:** No, because you bought insurance for me, and the driver seemed competent.

**Speaker 1:** So, having a driver provides some psychological comfort.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, the driver can take control if needed. If there were no driver, I'd be more concerned.
**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel sitting there?

**Speaker 2:**
It felt okay.

**Speaker 1:**
Right? Having a driver gives you a sense of security. He can control things if needed. Would you be worried if there was no driver?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I would be.

**Speaker 1:**
I would keep staring at him, haha, just keep watching them.

**Speaker 2:**
Yeah, exactly. So, our vehicle was actually on autopilot, and the driver was just there for safety purposes. We had a driver for the sake of the experiment. Did your feelings change knowing this?

**Speaker 1:**
My feeling was that the autopilot was faster than I expected. It also handled turns with more abrupt acceleration and deceleration than I imagined.

**Speaker 2:**
Were there moments when you thought it wasn't a real person driving?

**Speaker 1:**
I believed it was a real person the whole time. Was I fooled?

**Speaker 2:**
Did you pay attention to the driver? I don't think so, because when we were talking, I heard you say...

**Speaker 1:**
I didn't pay much attention. I was in the back seat, so I couldn't see the dashboard. Maybe the front passenger could see more.

**Speaker 2:**
I couldn't see the steering wheel or the headlights. Speaking of pedestrians, how do you judge the intentions of non-motorized vehicles or cars at an intersection without traffic lights? Do you decide to proceed or let them go?

**Speaker 1:**
If there are no traffic lights and not many cars, I usually look at the driver or a few people and ask if a car is coming. As a pedestrian, I try to figure out if they will yield to me. When I'm cycling, I might signal with my hand. For example, if I want to turn left and the car is going straight, I signal to let them know my intention. If I want to go before them, I signal and quickly pass. If I decide to let them go first, I stop and wait.

**Speaker 2:**
How do you judge if they will let you go?

**Speaker 1:**
You can tell if they don't slow down at all. If they don't, I let them go first. Some cars slow down and stop to let you pass. It's quite obvious.

**Speaker 2:**
Would you keep...
**Speaker 1:**
So, when you encounter a situation where a car is slowing down to let you pass, do you choose to keep observing and gradually move forward, wait for all the cars to pass, or just go ahead?

**Speaker 2:**
It depends on the situation. I would never just rush ahead. If I see a car slowing down clearly to let me pass, I will proceed. But if I see a line of cars with no intention of stopping, I will wait.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you look at the driver to gauge their intention?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I do. I prefer to be passive and wait for the driver to signal me to go. If I act too quickly and they don't stop, it could lead to an accident.

**Speaker 1:**
That makes sense. So, you rely on the driver's cues rather than taking the initiative yourself.

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly. For instance, in Wuxi, where I often drive, drivers are generally very courteous. Even if there are no traffic lights, they will stop to let pedestrians cross. This is common in many parts of Jiangsu province.

**Speaker 1:**
We had another interviewee who mentioned a similar experience. He was also from Jiangsu.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, when I was studying in Jiangsu and visited Wuxi, I noticed the same thing. Drivers there are very considerate.

**Speaker 1:**
It seems like the driving culture there is quite high. Well, I think that wraps up our interview for today. Do you have any questions before we finish?

**Speaker 2:**
Is this really about autonomous driving?

**Speaker 1:**
No, it's not. If it were about autonomous driving, it would be illegal on this road. We're just trying to understand your driving experience.

**Speaker 2:**
I don't think it feels like autonomous driving.

**Speaker 1:**
That's correct, it's not autonomous driving.

**Speaker 2:**
It doesn't feel like being a taxi driver either.

**Speaker 1:**
Autonomous driving tends to be very smooth and maintains a safe distance at all times, as you mentioned.
