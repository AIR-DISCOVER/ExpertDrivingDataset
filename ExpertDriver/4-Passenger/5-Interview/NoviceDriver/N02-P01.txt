**Speaker 1:**
OK, let me start by asking a few questions. Do you often travel by car?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I do. 

**Speaker 1:**
Do you usually take long trips or short trips?

**Speaker 2:**
Mostly short trips.

**Speaker 1:**
How long are these short trips typically?

**Speaker 2:**
Usually around ten minutes.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you usually take a taxi?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I take taxis. I haven't really taken long-distance buses.

**Speaker 1:**
When do you usually take long-distance buses?

**Speaker 2:**
Mostly when I'm going home during holidays.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about your experience with our car this time?

**Speaker 2:**
It felt quite stable.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think the stability was due to the driver or the road conditions?

**Speaker 2:**
I think it was mostly due to the driver.

**Speaker 1:**
Was the driver a woman?

**Speaker 2:**
No, the driver was a man.

**Speaker 1:**
If you had to choose, what type of car would you prefer for traveling? For example, an electric car or a gasoline car? Or maybe an SUV?

**Speaker 2:**
I would prefer an SUV because it feels higher and more spacious. When I take taxis, I often feel cramped in the back seat and can't sit comfortably.

**Speaker 1:**
Does this cramped feeling make you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it does.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you drive yourself?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I don't usually drive unless it's necessary.

**Speaker 1:**
If you did drive, how do you think you would rate your driving skills?

**Speaker 2:**
I think I need improvement. I haven't practiced much since I got my driver's license.

**Speaker 1:**
I noticed on your application form that you mentioned having been in a car accident. Is that correct?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it happened when I was driving my instructor's car to school for a practical lesson. I was on Tsinghua Road, and there was a bicycle in front of me. I was driving at around 25 mph, but I didn't manage the distance well and ended up scraping the bicycle. It caused some minor damage to the car.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you handle the insurance for that incident?

**Speaker 2:**
The instructor took care of it. It was a minor collision, so it wasn't a big issue.

**Speaker 1:**
Now, we need to review the video of the route you just drove. If there are any specific moments that stand out to you, please let us know.
**Speaker 1:**  
Alright, we're going to watch the video of the route you just drove. If there are any specific moments that stand out to you, or if there were any parts of the road where you felt your personal safety was threatened or you felt anxious or uncomfortable, just let me know, okay?  

**Speaker 2:**  
Sure.

**Speaker 1:**  
Let's start. What do you mean you can't find it? Why?

**Speaker 1:**  
Hold on a second. Is it because I removed the hard drive, so it's not in there?  

**Speaker 2:**  
Didn't you have it connected to this computer?

**Speaker 1:**  
No, I just opened it at that time.

**Speaker 2:**  
Then it might be the hard drive, okay.

**Speaker 1:**  
I need to copy it. I'll record it for you. Are you nervous? It's okay. Alright.

**Speaker 1:**  
How did you feel about that turn just now?

**Speaker 2:**  
I think you need to slow down a bit. If you go too fast, it could be dangerous.

**Speaker 1:**  
Was he driving fast?  

**Speaker 2:**  
Not really.

**Speaker 1:**  
How did you feel when there was a person walking ahead?

**Speaker 2:**  
I felt okay because the pedestrian was on the sidewalk, and the driver was close enough to gauge the distance easily.

**Speaker 1:**  
How did you feel when entering this section of the road?

**Speaker 2:**  
I didn't feel much. How about when the pedestrian was crossing the street?

**Speaker 2:**  
I felt the driver was steady, and the pedestrian didn't stop or hesitate, so I felt they could cross safely.

**Speaker 1:**  
How did you feel when that small car suddenly came out?

**Speaker 2:**  
I felt it could easily lead to an accident if the car was slower and the other driver was faster.

**Speaker 1:**  
Did you feel a bit nervous at that moment?

**Speaker 2:**  
Not really, because both were moving relatively slowly.

**Speaker 1:**  
Did he accelerate in this section? Was he driving fast?

**Speaker 2:**  
It felt okay. I think he accelerated on the way back.

**Speaker 1:**  
How did you feel about that?

**Speaker 2:**  
It felt alright since there weren't many cars ahead.

**Speaker 1:**  
Was the stop steady?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, it was steady.

**Speaker 1:**  
How about this part?

**Speaker 2:**  
I felt a bit uneasy. If the car behind didn't slow down, it might have bumped into us. But it was fine.

**Speaker 1:**  
Let me check.

**Speaker 2:**  
I was worried that the front of the car might hit the curb.

**Speaker 1:**  
This car?

**Speaker 2:**  
No, the curb. When he was coming over.

**Speaker 1:**  
Did you feel the distance was a bit close?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, but there weren't many cars on this road. How did you feel about this spot with the two pedestrians?
**Speaker 1:**
When he approached, did you feel he was a bit too close? There weren't many cars on this road. How did you feel about this area? There are two pedestrians.

**Speaker 2:**
I felt that the pedestrians were okay because the car had stopped, so it was fine.

**Speaker 1:**
There's a bicycle up ahead.

**Speaker 2:**
I think it's fine. The cyclist seems to be heading in that direction.

**Speaker 1:**
When the driver slowed down, how did you feel about his maneuver?

**Speaker 2:**
It felt relatively smooth. I didn't think it was a sudden brake.

**Speaker 1:**
Did a bicycle just cut in front of us? How did you feel about that? The cyclist went straight, and then we turned right.

**Speaker 2:**
If the timing isn't handled well, it can easily lead to mistakes. But we managed to avoid it.

**Speaker 1:**
Did the car's automatic system give you any particular feeling?

**Speaker 2:**
I think it was because the driver was about to turn, and the bicycle had already passed by then.

**Speaker 1:**
So there was a certain distance.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, if the bicycle was behind us and the driver didn't see it in the rearview mirror, it could have been risky.

**Speaker 1:**
That could be.

**Speaker 2:**
But the bicycle had already passed halfway through the intersection.

**Speaker 1:**
This area, this area.

**Speaker 2:**
I feel it's very easy to have minor collisions here because of the oncoming traffic, the narrow road, and the tricycles. If not handled well, it could be problematic.

**Speaker 1:**
This place is quite narrow. So your main concern is the potential for minor collisions between vehicles, right? You are very focused on this aspect.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because I've had such experiences before, so I feel it's very likely.

**Speaker 1:**
Once bitten, twice shy. 

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, he needs to maintain a safe distance.

**Speaker 1:**
In areas like this, it's very easy to have issues. There's oncoming traffic, and cars ahead. Have you ever experienced a situation where the car in front suddenly braked?

**Speaker 2:**
No, not suddenly.

**Speaker 1:**
Does the driver generally drive fast or slow?

**Speaker 2:**
I feel he drives relatively slow.

**Speaker 1:**
When people are crossing the street here, how do you feel?

**Speaker 2:**
I watch to see if they stop or not. If they stop, and if they want to turn left, you should...

**Speaker 1:**
Stop.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, stop and wait for them to cross. If they are crossing the street, you need to be cautious. Also, pay attention to the traffic lights and the overall traffic situation.

**Speaker 1:**
So you consider all these factors comprehensively: pedestrians, traffic conditions, and other vehicles.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I do.
**Speaker 1:** How do you consider the traffic conditions and road situations while driving? Do you take into account factors like pedestrians, traffic, and other vehicles?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I think it's important to consider all these factors. But I believe the most crucial factor is the human element. Even if a pedestrian violates traffic rules, as a driver, you should still be cautious and avoid any accidents.

**Speaker 1:** So, you're saying that a driver's skill is important, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, but I'm also talking about pedestrians.

**Speaker 1:** How do you feel about the interaction between pedestrians and motor vehicles?

**Speaker 2:** When they are moving in the same direction as us, it can be tricky.

**Speaker 1:** What do you mean?

**Speaker 2:** For example, if a pedestrian is waiting for an electric bike to pass.

**Speaker 1:** Oh, so they are waiting for the bike to pass.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, if they don't wait, it could lead to an accident.

**Speaker 1:** So, the pedestrian is waiting for the bike to completely pass.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, they are waiting.

**Speaker 1:** Is this a two-way street or a one-way street?

**Speaker 2:** It should be a two-way street. I'm not sure about the one-way streets in Beijing, though.

**Speaker 1:** I remember in school, there weren't many cars, so I could follow the rules strictly.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, but later I realized that the line was a broken yellow line, so you could actually cross it.

**Speaker 1:** Right, if there are no cars and no surveillance, you can cross it. Do you drive often?

**Speaker 2:** That was my first time driving after getting my license. I told my instructor that I had a license but hadn't driven before. The day before, I practiced a bit, and then the next day, I drove.

**Speaker 1:** That's quite a big step. How long have you had your license?

**Speaker 2:** About two or three years.

**Speaker 1:** You might have forgotten some things. I got my license around the same time.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, if you don't practice, you forget.

**Speaker 1:** But you managed to drive on your first try, which is impressive.

**Speaker 2:** It was an automatic car, but I learned on a manual.

**Speaker 1:** Do you prefer automatic or manual?

**Speaker 2:** I definitely prefer automatic. It's easier since you don't have to use your hands as much.

**Speaker 1:** There aren't many manual cars around anymore.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, they're rare now. And there's another video of us driving back.
**Speaker 1:**
Nowadays, there aren't many manual transmission cars left, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yeah, they're pretty much gone. There was another video, two in total, showing the place where you were returning.

**Speaker 1:**
I noticed that the car accelerated. How did you feel about that?

**Speaker 2:**
It was okay because there weren't many cars around. But when we were approaching a sharp turn, I felt that if the driver hadn't braked, we might have hit the car in front. Luckily, they did brake a bit.

**Speaker 1:**
Did they have to brake suddenly?

**Speaker 2:**
No, there wasn't any sudden braking. The comments about the driving were a bit harsh, though.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you notice any dangerous maneuvers by the driver during the trip?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't really notice any.

**Speaker 1:**
Overall, did you feel uncomfortable at any point?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really. I was mainly observing the road conditions.

**Speaker 1:**
Was there anything the driver did that made you feel uneasy?

**Speaker 2:**
No, nothing in particular.

**Speaker 1:**
What about the parked vehicle up ahead? Any thoughts on that?

**Speaker 2:**
If you want to pass it, you need to judge the distance carefully. The driver didn't try to overtake it. If they had, they would need to be sure there was enough space to do so safely.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you notice several Meituan delivery scooters going the wrong way?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I saw them. They were moving slowly, so it wasn't too concerning.

**Speaker 1:**
So, if the speed and distance of the vehicle in front are appropriate, you don't feel uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly. If the vehicle in front is moving slowly, it's manageable. If it's fast, you have less time to react, which can be problematic.

**Speaker 1:**
Right, less reaction time isn't good. What do you think constitutes safe driving behavior, disregarding today's specific trip and road conditions?

**Speaker 2:**
For safe driving, I think it's crucial to be familiar with traffic rules and basic vehicle operations. Different cars have different configurations and features, so it's important to get accustomed to the specific vehicle you're driving before hitting the road.
**Speaker 1:**
It seems like different cars have different configurations and models. Maybe you were driving someone else's car, and the setup was different. So, it's important to familiarize yourself with the car's operations before driving. Otherwise, in an emergency, you might not know how to operate certain features.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. You need to understand the basic operations of the vehicle.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you mean by basic operations?

**Speaker 2:**
I mean, the basic operations of driving the vehicle.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you specify what basic operations a driver should be aware of?

**Speaker 2:**
I think it's important to check the vehicle's condition after getting in. 

**Speaker 1:**
The vehicle's condition, right.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, check the vehicle's condition and then look at the dashboard and the information displayed there.

**Speaker 1:**
The dashboard, right.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the information displayed on the dashboard.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you mean the driver should familiarize themselves with these things first?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. For instance, I noticed that the dashboard of the car I was in earlier showed a warning light, possibly for oil or something. It’s important to ensure that everything is in order before driving.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you mean making sure the car is in a normal operating condition?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, not necessarily fully fueled, but at least with enough fuel to operate normally.

**Speaker 1:**
Does this affect the vehicle's safety?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it does. If you drive with low fuel or other issues, the car might stop unexpectedly, which can be unsafe.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it could stop on the road and cause unsafe situations?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it could. Seeing warning lights on the dashboard is generally not a good sign. Although I haven't experienced it myself, I learned that such warnings should be taken seriously.

**Speaker 1:**
So, ensuring the car is in a normal state is crucial?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, ensuring it’s in a normal state is important.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you define the safety of a vehicle's operation?

**Speaker 2:**
I think safety means not getting into accidents, avoiding collisions with other vehicles and pedestrians. Also, not speeding and following traffic rules.

**Speaker 1:**
Have you ever felt unsafe while riding in someone else's car, like when taking a taxi?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, sometimes sudden braking can make me feel unsafe.
**Speaker 1:** Have you ever felt unsafe due to the behavior of other drivers during your driving experience?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I think sudden braking is a major issue. It could be because the car in front suddenly brakes, or a pedestrian suddenly appears on the road, or pedestrians don't stop at crosswalks, leading to sudden braking. Also, when turning, if the other vehicle doesn't slow down, it can cause sudden braking. In these situations, I often see drivers getting quite frustrated and sometimes even cursing.

**Speaker 1:** If the other driver suddenly brakes, do you feel the same way?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I do. If I don't brake in time, I might end up hitting them.

**Speaker 1:** How do you think a driver should drive to make you feel more comfortable?

**Speaker 2:** The driver should be focused but not too tense. They should maintain a smooth driving line, be aware of the traffic conditions, make accurate judgments, and control the vehicle timely. They should also handle unexpected situations promptly.

**Speaker 1:** If these conditions are not met, do you feel a threat to your personal safety?

**Speaker 2:** Not necessarily a direct threat, but it does make me feel uneasy. It feels like there might be some minor danger, like the driver is a bit reckless or not very steady.

**Speaker 1:** So, if the driver is not steady, you feel uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. Especially if they drive too fast or don't slow down when turning, it feels like the car is drifting.

**Speaker 1:** Have you ever experienced a driver speeding?

**Speaker 2:** I haven't been in a car with a speeding driver, but I have experienced sudden braking or not slowing down when turning.

**Speaker 1:** Oh, so in special situations, they don't slow down and continue driving as usual?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, maybe they are in a hurry and don't slow down. It makes the ride feel unstable, and the car can easily drift when turning.

**Speaker 1:** Do you feel dizzy in such situations?

**Speaker 2:** No, I don't feel dizzy. Physically, I don't feel any discomfort. But it does make me uneasy.

**Speaker 1:** What do you think makes a driver professional or good?

**Speaker 2:** First, they should have a valid driver's license. They should also avoid traffic accidents, and if they do have an accident, they should learn from it and improve their driving skills.
**Speaker 1:**
First of all, the driver should definitely have a valid driver's license. Then, it's important that they haven't been involved in traffic accidents. Even if they have, they should be able to learn from those experiences and handle similar situations better in the future. When unexpected situations arise, they should be able to manage them flexibly. It's not just about being steady and safe all the time; sometimes, you need to react quickly. For example, if a car is about to hit you, you need to accelerate to avoid the collision. If you hesitate, you might get hit. So, it's a mix of being steady when needed and quick when necessary.

**Speaker 2:**
So, you don't equate stability with safety, right?

**Speaker 1:**
Exactly. Stability is just one aspect of safety, but it's not everything.

**Speaker 2:**
It depends on the actual situation. Do you care about the time it takes to reach your destination?

**Speaker 1:**
It depends on how urgent the situation is. If it's not urgent, safety comes first. But if I'm rushing to catch a train, I would ask the driver to speed up a bit. I would also choose a route with less traffic to save time.

**Speaker 2:**
How do you define comfort?

**Speaker 1:**
Comfort, to me, means how well the seat fits and how the car handles bumps on the road.

**Speaker 2:**
You mean the car's suspension system?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, a good suspension system makes the ride more comfortable, especially on bumpy roads.

**Speaker 2:**
Have you experienced any bumpy roads today?

**Speaker 1:**
No, not today. The driver was quite steady. The seat was comfortable too.

**Speaker 2:**
So, you're a new driver, right? What's the biggest difference between you and an experienced driver?

**Speaker 1:**
I think the biggest difference is the lack of driving experience. I haven't driven much or encountered many different situations, so I often feel unsure of what to do.

**Speaker 2:**
Are there any other differences?

**Speaker 1:**
Not really, it's mainly about the experience. What do you think autonomous cars can't do as well as human drivers?
**Speaker 1:** So, what do you think are the aspects where autonomous cars can't match human drivers?

**Speaker 2:** I think it might be in emergency situations. There could be a delay in response. If a human is driving, they might react faster to sudden obstacles. If the autonomous system can reduce this delay to be comparable to human reaction times, that would be ideal.

**Speaker 1:** So, you believe humans are more flexible in their responses?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, they might be more flexible.

**Speaker 1:** Besides flexibility, do you think there are other differences?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, definitely.

**Speaker 1:** How would you define intelligence in the context of autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:** It should be able to perform many tasks like a human, but not necessarily all tasks. It should be able to handle most driving scenarios but might struggle with some complex situations.

**Speaker 1:** What do you mean by "like a human"?

**Speaker 2:** It should be able to do many things that humans can do, and maybe even do some things better, but not everything.

**Speaker 1:** What specific tasks do you think humans excel at during driving?

**Speaker 2:** Normal driving tasks like accelerating, point-to-point navigation, and reacting to real-time situations. Humans can handle unexpected events better than current autonomous systems.

**Speaker 1:** So, it can mimic human behavior to some extent in driving. Do you think the driving we just experienced was done by a human or the car's autonomous system?

**Speaker 2:** I think it was a human driving. That's what I felt based on the way the car was being handled.

**Speaker 1:** Why do you think it was a human driving?

**Speaker 2:** I noticed the driver's foot on the brake or accelerator and saw them using the steering wheel. These actions made me feel it was a human driving.

**Speaker 1:** So, you observed the driver using the steering wheel and reacting to real-time situations. If the car we just rode in was actually driving autonomously, how would you feel?

**Speaker 2:** I would probably feel a bit worried. I might be concerned about its ability to handle sudden situations.
**Speaker 1:** If the vehicle is actually driving autonomously, how would you feel about that?

**Speaker 2:** Oh, I would definitely be a bit worried. I might be concerned about whether it can handle emergencies like a human would, whether it can brake smoothly or if it would brake too abruptly in a critical situation. I think it should be able to judge the distance to an object and its speed, and then decide how hard to brake based on that. Ideally, it should be similar to how a human would react. Of course, it also depends on the sensitivity of the car's brakes. Some brakes are harder or softer, so a light press might be enough, or it might require a firmer press.

**Speaker 1:** Have there been moments when you felt that the driver might not be a real person? Did you ever get that feeling?

**Speaker 2:** I did have that feeling a bit. It's not like we're dealing with something supernatural here. But I saw the driver was fully engaged, so I felt reassured. However, I did have a slight feeling that it might be autonomous, but I was mostly convinced it was a real driver.

**Speaker 1:** Besides the experiment itself, were there any other factors that made you think it was autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:** What kind of factors?

**Speaker 1:** Any behaviors or signs, whether inside or outside the car, not just the driver.

**Speaker 2:** I think the car had some indicators.

**Speaker 1:** Haha, so it’s still related to the experiment. What about the car?

**Speaker 1:** If you were at an intersection without traffic lights, how would you judge the intentions of the vehicles or cyclists around you? Whether they want to turn or go straight?

**Speaker 2:** For non-motorized vehicles or cars, I would look at their turn signals or the direction of the front wheels.

**Speaker 1:** Would you choose to go straight through?

**Speaker 2:** I would definitely assess the situation first, see if they hesitate, and then decide.

**Speaker 1:** Would you wait for all the vehicles to pass before moving forward, or would you observe and move step by step?

**Speaker 2:** I would observe and then move forward. I wouldn’t wait for all of them to pass before I go. There are situations where I would move step by step.

**Speaker 1:** Did you have any prior knowledge about autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I had some basic understanding. I had heard about it before, but...
**Speaker 1:**
Hmm, have you heard about autonomous driving before?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I have some knowledge about it. I initially heard about it from movies, like in the "Fast and Furious" series. I can't remember which installment, but there were a lot of autonomous cars. The cars were old models, and there was a scene where they drove off a building and crashed, yet they could still control many vehicles.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you trust human drivers more, or do you trust autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:**
I definitely trust human drivers more. However, if the driver is reckless, then I would prefer autonomous driving.

**Speaker 1:**
What are your requirements for a driver’s skills?

**Speaker 2:**
At the very least, the driver should not have been involved in any traffic accidents, or if they have, they should not have repeated the same mistakes. Also, they should not drink and drive or argue while driving.

**Speaker 1:**
Is there anything else? Are you satisfied with our driver today and the overall driving experience?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I am quite satisfied. The driving was stable.

**Speaker 1:**
Okay, that concludes our interview for today. Thank you very much for your participation. Your information will be kept confidential. Do you need to go back to work now?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I don't need to go back. I'm done for the day.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you're heading home directly?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I’ll go home and return to work tomorrow.

**Speaker 1:**
Where do you live? Is it far from here?

**Speaker 2:**
I live in the Xicheng District. Is it far by subway?

**Speaker 1:**
It takes a little over an hour by subway. How do you usually commute?

**Speaker 2:**
I usually take the subway.
