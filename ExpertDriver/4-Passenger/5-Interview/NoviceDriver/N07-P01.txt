**Speaker 1:**
Before we watch the video, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your usual travel habits. Do you often travel by car?

**Speaker 2:**
Not often, because...

**Speaker 1:**
Not often. When you do travel by car, is it usually for long distances or short distances?

**Speaker 2:**
For long distances. Short distances are usually...

**Speaker 1:**
Around the school area. How long do you usually travel when you go out?

**Speaker 2:**
About 20 minutes or so.

**Speaker 1:**
About 20 minutes.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, around 10 to 20 minutes.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about the ride during this experiment?

**Speaker 2:**
Overall, it felt...

**Speaker 1:**
It felt quite comfortable. How do you think the driver’s skills were?

**Speaker 2:**
The driving was generally smooth, but there was a moment where...

**Speaker 1:**
A moment where?

**Speaker 2:**
There was a turn that wasn’t made properly, and the driver had to reverse and try again.

**Speaker 1:**
Could you point that out to me in the video later?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the video should show it.

**Speaker 1:**
If you had a choice, what type of car would you prefer to travel in?

**Speaker 2:**
What type? Like...

**Speaker 1:**
In terms of car model and fuel type, for example.

**Speaker 2:**
I generally prefer...

**Speaker 1:**
Fuel-powered cars. Why do you prefer them?

**Speaker 2:**
Fuel-powered? Because electric cars tend to jolt a bit when starting and stopping, which feels uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
What about the car model?

**Speaker 2:**
The model would be...

**Speaker 1:**
An SUV, because it’s spacious. Do you drive yourself?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I have a license but I don’t drive often.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you think your driving skills are?

**Speaker 2:**
Not very good, I suppose.

**Speaker 1:**
Have you practiced much?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, I will now play the video of our recent drive. If at any point you feel a change in your experience, please let me know. I might pause at certain points to ask about your feelings. Let’s start, and please pay attention to avoid any mistakes. Thank you for your cooperation. The system is ready to go.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel when the driver started the car?

**Speaker 2:**
The situation was... because the road was quite simple.

**Speaker 1:**
Was it a bit bumpy?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because the road was narrow and not in great condition, so it was a bit bumpy.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel uncomfortable at that time?

**Speaker 2:**
No, it was just a normal bumpy feeling.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, good.
**Speaker 1:**
So, how was the ride? Did it feel bumpy?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was a bit bumpy, but nothing too bad.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel uncomfortable at any point?

**Speaker 2:**
No, it was just a normal bumpy ride. It was fine. The driver did well navigating all those turns while exiting the parking lot.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about the turns? Did you feel like you were being thrown around?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't feel like I was being thrown around.

**Speaker 1:**
What about the right turn here? How did that feel?

**Speaker 2:**
It was fine. It felt like the usual turns we take when we go out.

**Speaker 1:**
So, nothing out of the ordinary?

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly. The driver handled the situations on the road as expected.

**Speaker 1:**
How did the driver do on the side road? Did you feel any bumps?

**Speaker 2:**
No, but I noticed the camera shook a bit.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you pay attention to the road conditions when the driver changed lanes?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really. The only thing I noticed was during the U-turn. It felt a bit off.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you elaborate on that?

**Speaker 2:**
It seemed like the driver struggled with the U-turn. It wasn't smooth.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you hear any beeping from the radar? Were you concerned?

**Speaker 2:**
I thought there might be an issue with the equipment.

**Speaker 1:**
What happened?

**Speaker 2:**
I saw the radar indicating something, probably because the car was too close to an object.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel the car was too close to something?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it seemed like the car was getting too close to a person or an object, which triggered the red warning.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you notice this while it was happening?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't notice it at the time. It became apparent when the driver had to reverse and try the U-turn again.

**Speaker 1:**
Were you worried about safety during the U-turn?

**Speaker 2:**
Initially, it seemed fine, but the reversing made me think the driver wasn't very confident or experienced.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel the driver was inexperienced?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it felt like the driver wasn't used to making such maneuvers and didn't judge the distance well.

**Speaker 1:**
Why didn't you use the handle for support?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't feel uncomfortable enough to use it. I just felt the driver was inexperienced.
**Speaker 1:** Did you press the handle?

**Speaker 2:** But why wasn't it there? At that moment, I felt that pressing the handle didn't make me uncomfortable. I didn't feel uncomfortable; I just thought the driver might have made a misjudgment about the distance or something, so he had to reverse and try again.

**Speaker 1:** So you think this is normal?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I think it's normal for a driver. Sometimes they might make a misjudgment. When he was driving forward, everything was smooth, including the turns and lane changes.

**Speaker 1:** When you say smooth, do you mean at a constant speed?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, the operation was not tense, and the car moved smoothly. The driver was cautious, waiting for other cars to pass before proceeding slowly.

**Speaker 1:** So, overall, it was smooth?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, throughout the process, it was smooth.

**Speaker 1:** The car was moving at a constant speed and was stable.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, except for that moment when it jolted. It must have gone over a manhole cover.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel the manhole cover when you were in the car?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I saw it. The car moved to the right and went over the manhole cover.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel uncomfortable, like a jolt?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it was a bit uncomfortable, like being jolted. But it's something you often experience in daily life when riding in a car. It didn't make me particularly uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:** So the discomfort was your subjective feeling?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, there's no specific definition for it.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel anything special when passing the entrance?

**Speaker 2:** No, it was fine. Later, it was just normal.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel car sick?

**Speaker 2:** No, I often travel this route. Sometimes I do, but not today.

**Speaker 1:** Was the turn smooth?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, even when going over the speed bump and making a left turn, there was nothing special.

**Speaker 1:** I felt the driver was a bit slow. Do you think so?

**Speaker 2:** I felt a bit tense.

**Speaker 1:** How do you feel about this kind of driving?

**Speaker 2:** It's good. Why? If you're not in a hurry, it feels safer.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel any danger at that time?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't notice anything.

**Speaker 1:** What didn't you notice?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't notice any danger.

**Speaker 1:** Because the driver didn't seem to finish?

**Speaker 2:** There was no danger in the database. Later, there were a few turns, but there weren't many people around. He made a few turns without much editing. It felt a bit fast.

**Speaker 1:** So you think...
**Speaker 1:** At that turn, there weren't many people around. He made a few turns without much editing. It felt a bit fast.

**Speaker 2:** I didn't really notice the scene.

**Speaker 1:** Looking at it now, what do you think?

**Speaker 2:** It looks quite dangerous. Were there people around?

**Speaker 1:** It felt like the driver should have slowed down a bit.

**Speaker 2:** He probably didn't hesitate.

**Speaker 1:** When he passed the yellow car, it seemed like he didn't slow down.

**Speaker 2:** He didn't slow down.

**Speaker 1:** When you were sitting in the passenger seat, where were you looking? Were you looking ahead?

**Speaker 2:** Sometimes I was looking ahead, sometimes outside, and sometimes to the side. There were buildings and trees on the side, so I would look at those occasionally.

**Speaker 1:** When you were looking to the side, did it mean you felt there was no risk at that moment?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I only focus on the driver when I'm nervous.

**Speaker 1:** Besides the U-turn, were there any other sections of the road that made you feel tense?

**Speaker 2:** No, I usually get tense when there are a lot of cars around.

**Speaker 1:** The right turn was also quite slow.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it was more relaxed. On the way back, it felt a bit smoother.

**Speaker 1:** Was the right turn normal? Was there any point on this road where you felt the speed was too fast because there weren't many cars?

**Speaker 2:** The turn was quite sharp, wasn't it?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, it seemed like it. There was another one after that. It felt like he didn't slow down much.

**Speaker 1:** Do sharp turns make you feel uncomfortable or unsafe?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, they make me feel unsafe.

**Speaker 1:** Why do you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:** I'm afraid the car might lose control. If another car comes from the opposite direction, it could be very dangerous. Also, taking sharp turns too quickly makes me feel like I might be thrown out of the car. It just feels dangerous.

**Speaker 1:** Did you notice any oncoming traffic at that time?

**Speaker 2:** No, I didn't.

**Speaker 1:** Did the car stop at that point?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it did. The other car let us pass. Looking back, do you think we should have slowed down or stopped?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, I would usually slow down a bit and move to the side.

**Speaker 2:** That's the right thing to do. This turn wasn't too tight, and the road was quite clear.

**Speaker 1:** Did he start accelerating after that?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it felt like he sped up on the way back.
**Speaker 1:** So, did he start accelerating after that?

**Speaker 2:** From that point? It seems like it.

**Speaker 1:** I mean, did he speed up on the way back? It felt quite fast.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it was a bit faster than before. Didn't you feel it in the car?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, I felt it was a bit faster in the second half. 

**Speaker 2:** Did you notice it from the video or while in the car? I didn't feel much during the left turn.

**Speaker 1:** Did the driver brake abruptly? No, it wasn't sudden.

**Speaker 2:** I don't like sudden braking when I'm in the car. If it's smooth, I'm fine with it. I haven't encountered any issues.

**Speaker 1:** This was the first or second time, right?

**Speaker 1:** Did you notice the distance between cars? Was it safe? Did you feel sleepy in the car? 

**Speaker 2:** I was alert. I had rested in the afternoon.

**Speaker 1:** Did you notice the road conditions on the way back? 

**Speaker 2:** I didn't pay much attention to it.

**Speaker 1:** So, it was just normal traffic, no hesitation.

**Speaker 1:** From the way he made the U-turn, you could tell he was a new driver.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, that's what I thought.

**Speaker 1:** You mentioned that you felt he might not be very experienced.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, the way he made the U-turn made me think he might not be very skilled. But as we continued, his driving was actually quite competent. He handled the car well on the road. It was just that one U-turn that he didn't manage well, which made me think he was a bit nervous.

**Speaker 1:** It's possible. We usually don't hire inexperienced drivers.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. From that point on, everything was fine until we got back. 

**Speaker 1:** Oh, he ran a red light here.

**Speaker 1:** There were quite a few cars during the U-turn. Were you worried about safety?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, there were a lot of cars, but I wasn't too worried about safety.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about the driver's handling of the situation?

**Speaker 2:** I was a bit concerned about the oncoming traffic, but the driver handled it well and didn't drive too fast.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, he drove cautiously. Has he driven this route before?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, he has. If he takes a wrong turn, he has to redo the route.

**Speaker 1:** Understood.
**Speaker 1:** Has the driver driven on this route before? This isn't his first time, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, he has done test drives before. If he takes a wrong turn, he has to drive the route again.

**Speaker 1:** I see. So, he just needs to make a loop to find the right entrance. He must have driven this route a few times.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:** Earlier, the reverse radar beeped. Did you notice it at that time?

**Speaker 2:** No, I didn't notice. It was just indicating the distance.

**Speaker 1:** Where was it exactly?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't pay attention this time. The beep was quick, and by the time I reacted, I couldn't see anything.

**Speaker 1:** Were you worried at that moment?

**Speaker 2:** At first, when reversing, I was a bit concerned and tried to pay attention. Later, I wasn't sure if it was what you mentioned earlier. There was a moment when I looked at the screen, but I couldn't see anything.

**Speaker 1:** Getting too close is indeed unsafe. When you're a passenger in someone else's car, what actions make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:** Driving too fast. And...

**Speaker 1:** Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** Trying to overtake aggressively.

**Speaker 1:** Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** Encountering large trucks.

**Speaker 1:** What do you do when you encounter large trucks?

**Speaker 2:** If a large truck is in front and driving slowly, overtaking it can be nerve-wracking. Especially on mountain roads, if you try to overtake and another vehicle comes from the opposite direction, it can be very dangerous.

**Speaker 1:** Are there any other behaviors that make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:** Any reckless driving feels unsafe.

**Speaker 1:** That's all?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I can't think of anything else right now. If you have specific scenarios, I might be able to comment.

**Speaker 1:** This is just to let you freely express your thoughts. Everything seems normal here, nothing else?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, nothing else comes to mind.

**Speaker 1:** Besides the U-turn incident, did the driver perform any other dangerous maneuvers?

**Speaker 2:** No, nothing else. I didn't really watch how he was driving.

**Speaker 1:** Overall, you felt relatively safe?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I mentioned in the questionnaire that I felt quite safe with him driving.

**Speaker 1:** In your opinion, what makes driving safer?

**Speaker 2:** Driving safely means, first and foremost, driving slowly and steadily. Many issues can be avoided by driving slowly. When overtaking, it's crucial to be cautious. Also, following traffic rules is very important.
**Speaker 1:**
When overtaking, it's important to do it safely, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. When overtaking, you need to be cautious. If the car in front is slow, you should be steady. Also, always follow traffic regulations because safety is paramount.

**Speaker 1:**
Right.

**Speaker 2:**
If you only consider safety, then you must follow the rules. For example, when driving in the city, if you follow the traffic rules, you won't go wrong.

**Speaker 1:**
So, those are the two main points. Do you think the driver...

**Speaker 2:**
Additionally, it's crucial to stay alert while driving. You need to be fully awake and focused to drive safely. Otherwise, accidents can happen easily.

**Speaker 1:**
Avoid driving when tired. During this trip, did the driver do anything that made you uncomfortable? For example, did they take a turn too sharply?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, like accelerating without slowing down before a turn. That can be unsettling.

**Speaker 1:**
So, when they made a right turn from a wide road?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, they should be more careful with that.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
No, reversing doesn't count. There was a turn they didn't make properly and had to reverse and try again. That didn't bother me much.

**Speaker 1:**
You mean a U-turn?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, a U-turn. I didn't feel uncomfortable with that. Maybe they just didn't judge it well.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think makes for a more comfortable driving experience?

**Speaker 2:**
Driving slowly and following the rules. Also, signaling properly when changing lanes. Avoid sudden maneuvers.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you think safety and comfort are closely related?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, for a comfortable ride, the driver should drive smoothly without sudden acceleration or braking.

**Speaker 1:**
When you take a taxi or ride with family, what driving behaviors make you uncomfortable? Only driving-related actions, not things like smoking.

**Speaker 2:**
Sudden acceleration and braking. Driving too fast and then stopping suddenly, or the car jerking while driving.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
No, that's it.

**Speaker 1:**
In your opinion, what makes a good driver?

**Speaker 2:**
A good driver...
**Speaker 1:** Hmm, or when driving, there was a bit of a hesitation. So, do you think a driver can be considered a good driver?

**Speaker 2:** A good driver, yes. Well, it's like what I mentioned before, those things.

**Speaker 1:** So, someone who meets your standards for safety and comfort?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. Also, a good driver shouldn't be distracted by passengers or using their phone while driving.

**Speaker 1:** They need to stay focused.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I've encountered drivers who only use one hand on the steering wheel, which feels very dangerous.

**Speaker 1:** Do you consider yourself a novice driver or an experienced one?

**Speaker 2:** I wouldn't even call myself a novice because I've only driven once after getting my license.

**Speaker 1:** So, you would be a beginner. What do you think is the biggest difference between you and an experienced driver?

**Speaker 2:** Experienced drivers have a better sense of distance and timing. They know when to accelerate, when to overtake, and how to park properly. They are more relaxed, whereas I tend to be quite tense when driving.

**Speaker 1:** You get nervous easily.

**Speaker 2:** Very nervous.

**Speaker 1:** Have you heard about autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I've heard about it.

**Speaker 1:** Have you ever experienced it?

**Speaker 2:** No, I haven't.

**Speaker 1:** Based on your understanding, what do you think autonomous cars can never do as well as human drivers?

**Speaker 2:** I think they can't make certain judgments based on road conditions, like whether to stop or not. For example, if a pedestrian suddenly appears, I'm not sure if the system can recognize it properly. If there's an obstacle, will it think it's a person and stop unnecessarily?

**Speaker 1:** Generally, it can recognize obstacles.

**Speaker 2:** But if something suddenly appears, it might make an emergency stop.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, it would make an emergency stop.

**Speaker 2:** Right, because it might not handle it well.

**Speaker 1:** So, you're talking about recognition issues?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, recognition issues. It's all based on algorithms. In emergencies, sometimes you need to accelerate to avoid danger, but the system might just stop. I don't think it can make those human-like judgments.

**Speaker 1:** Any other aspects?

**Speaker 2:** No, that's all. I haven't tried it myself.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think the recent trip was driven by a person or by an autonomous system?

**Speaker 2:** I think it was driven by a person.

**Speaker 1:** Why do you think so?

**Speaker 2:** Because I observed...
**Speaker 1:**
Was the car being driven manually or was it on autopilot?

**Speaker 2:**
Do you think it was being driven manually?

**Speaker 1:**
Why do you think it was being driven manually?

**Speaker 2:**
I felt that way because I noticed some acceleration and deceleration in certain areas.

**Speaker 1:**
You mean the driver's actions and the car's movements?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the driver's actions.

**Speaker 1:**
So, the driver's actions and the car's movements were in sync?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't pay much attention to the driver's actions, but I felt the driver was constantly operating the vehicle. Is it because it looked like he was handling it well? Okay, let's move on.

**Speaker 1:**
Now, let's assume the driver was pretending to drive, and it was actually on autopilot, with the driver acting as a safety officer. If that's the case, what details felt different from your usual riding experience?

**Speaker 2:**
Which details? Well, I feel that a regular driver wouldn't make such mistakes unless there was an issue with the car.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you think the autopilot didn't recognize something properly, causing it to make a wrong move?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. It might have tried again.

**Speaker 1:**
Any other details?

**Speaker 2:**
There was also a turn where the car didn't slow down. I attributed that to the driver being skilled. There were no other cars around, and the road was wide, so he made the turn smoothly. If it were autopilot, it should have naturally slowed down due to its programming.

**Speaker 1:**
So, the detail about not slowing down during the turn made you think it was manual driving?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
When you're a pedestrian, for example, at an intersection without traffic lights, how do you judge the intentions of oncoming drivers?

**Speaker 2:**
At intersections without traffic lights, I usually wait until there are no cars.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you wait until there are no cars before crossing?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I wait until there are no cars. If a driver signals or slows down, I know they are letting me pass, so I wait.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you mainly judge by the car's signals?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, by the car's signals. Sometimes, if the driver slows down or stops, I know it's safe to cross.

**Speaker 1:**
Did the driver avoid pedestrians and cyclists during this trip?

**Speaker 2:**
There were very few on the road, but I think he did.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright.
**Speaker 1:** During this drive, did the driver make any efforts to avoid pedestrians or cyclists?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, there were a few instances, but they were rare.

**Speaker 1:** Rare, you say? So, it didn't happen often?

**Speaker 2:** Correct, it was quite infrequent.

**Speaker 1:** Were there specific areas where the driver needed to be more cautious?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, there were certain spots that required more attention.

**Speaker 1:** Alright, that concludes our questions for today. Thank you very much for participating in our experiment.

**Speaker 2:** You're welcome.
