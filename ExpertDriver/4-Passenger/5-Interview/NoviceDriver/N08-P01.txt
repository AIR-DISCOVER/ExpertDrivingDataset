**Speaker 1:**
Let's start the interview. I'll begin by asking a few questions about your usual travel habits. Do you often travel by car?

**Speaker 2:**
Not too often, but fairly frequently.

**Speaker 1:**
Fairly frequently. Right. Do you usually take long trips or short trips?

**Speaker 2:**
If it's around the school area, it's usually short trips. When I'm at home, sometimes I drive myself.

**Speaker 1:**
How long do you usually spend in the car?

**Speaker 2:**
Usually around ten minutes, but it can be longer, like forty to fifty minutes. If I'm going home to the station, it might take about an hour.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you find the experience of riding in our vehicle this time?

**Speaker 2:**
Are you asking about the vehicle itself or the driving experience?

**Speaker 1:**
Both are fine.

**Speaker 2:**
At first, it felt quite comfortable. There weren't many new sensations. As for the driving, I felt that the driver's habits were a bit different from what I'm used to. Initially, it was a bit awkward, and towards the end, I felt a bit nauseous, like I was car sick.

**Speaker 2:**
Other than that, it was fine. I was a bit nervous seeing so much equipment in the car.

**Speaker 1:**
When you have a choice, what type of car do you prefer to travel in?

**Speaker 2:**
I prefer SUVs because sedans can feel a bit cramped.

**Speaker 1:**
So, SUVs are more spacious and comfortable. Do you have any specific preferences between gasoline cars and electric cars?

**Speaker 2:**
When it comes to driving or riding, I don't notice much difference. I might prefer electric cars because they are usually automatic, and the acceleration feels smoother. Manual cars can be a bit jerky when starting, which isn't very comfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you feel that automatic cars have smoother start-stop transitions. Do you drive yourself often? How do you rate your driving skills?

**Speaker 2:**
I think my driving is quite standard and cautious. I don't drive very fast.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you're a cautious driver?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I recently returned from a long trip.

**Speaker 1:**
Oh, you drove a long distance?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was a long trip.
**Speaker 1:**
Yes, recently you mentioned you just got back from a trip.

**Speaker 2:**
Right, I did. It was quite a long drive.

**Speaker 1:**
Yeah, it seems like you drove for quite a long distance.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was long, but typically it was around two hours or a bit more.

**Speaker 1:**
Next, I will play the video of our recent drive. While watching, if you notice any moments where your experience changes, please let me know immediately.

**Speaker 2:**
Okay.

**Speaker 1:**
For example, if you feel the driver didn't drive well at a certain point, you can tell me. The tags below are for marking those moments using the handle. This part is just a test. Alright?

**Speaker 2:**
Got it.

**Speaker 1:**
Please do not adjust or operate any equipment during this period. The first sound will appear soon. Did you press the handle when the car started?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because I usually don't drive too fast, but there was a sudden acceleration that I didn't expect.

**Speaker 1:**
Your hand shook and you pressed it. Did you feel nervous at that moment?

**Speaker 2:**
A bit, yes. On small roads, I usually don't drive very fast. I generally keep it around ten or so when starting.

**Speaker 1:**
So, the sudden acceleration felt intense to you.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it felt quite intense to me.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel the car was going too fast?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it might be a matter of getting used to it. For me, sitting in the passenger seat, I often imagine how I would drive the car. I also observe the surrounding road conditions. If the driver's style differs from mine, I might feel uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you compared the driver's style with your own.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because the perspective from the passenger seat isn't very different from the driver's seat.

**Speaker 1:**
If you were sitting in the back seat, would your evaluation of the driver change?

**Speaker 2:**
If I were in the back seat, I would focus more on the physical sensations, like acceleration, deceleration, and turning, because the view isn't as wide as from the front seat.

**Speaker 1:**
So, the view from the passenger seat gave you more factors to evaluate the driver's style.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I consider many factors, like if someone suddenly appears nearby and the driver doesn't notice, it makes me a bit nervous.

**Speaker 1:**
After the turn, you pressed the handle again.
Speaker 1:
Because I considered many factors, it could be that someone suddenly appeared nearby, and I didn't notice, which made me a bit nervous.

Speaker 2:
After turning, I pressed the handle again. Yes.

Speaker 1:
Because the turn was very quick, I felt that if I were driving, it wouldn't be that fast.

Speaker 2:
Do you think it was disorienting for you?

Speaker 1:
Not really, it was just the car's inertia, which was a bit strong. Initially, I wasn't quite used to it, but later on, I got accustomed to it.

Speaker 2:
When the driver made a sharp turn, he was close to other cars and some electric bikes on the left.

Speaker 1:
At that moment, I felt it was okay because, from my perspective, having driven before, I thought it should be fine. So, there wasn't much of an issue.

Speaker 2:
So, the quick turn mainly made you feel uncomfortable?

Speaker 1:
Yes, it was just a sudden adjustment that I wasn't used to.

Speaker 2:
Alright, there are many turns here, and each one is quite similar.

Speaker 1:
Yes, from the car window, it felt a bit tense.

Speaker 2:
Were you sitting in the front passenger seat at that time?

Speaker 1:
Yes, when the car came over. I was also afraid of hitting it.

Speaker 2:
The driver made several sharp turns while exiting the parking lot. Were those turns very abrupt?

Speaker 1:
Yes, during the test, it was consistent. But once I got used to it, I felt it was okay. However, I noticed he was steering with one hand, which felt a bit unsafe to me.

Speaker 2:
The driver was steering with one hand?

Speaker 1:
Yes, he was steering with one hand. It was different from my driving habits. I've only been driving for a little over a year, so I focus more on safety. I usually don't drive like that.

Speaker 2:
How did you feel about the right turn ahead?

Speaker 1:
That was fine because the surrounding road conditions were clear, with no pedestrians, and there was plenty of space, so I didn't feel much.

Speaker 2:
We might ask many similar questions about road conditions. If everything feels normal, just say so.

Speaker 1:
Okay.

Speaker 2:
The right turn was quite normal. After 200 meters, turn left. How did you feel about the overall driving on the side road?

Speaker 1:
I felt there were some slight left and right movements. It felt a bit unpredictable at times.
**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about his driving on the side road? Did you think he was driving well?

**Speaker 2:** Well, I felt there were some slight deviations to the left and right. It seemed like he was making sudden movements at times, which made the driving feel a bit unsteady.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think this has anything to do with him steering with one hand?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I think it does. When steering with one hand, especially during turns, you can feel that the turns aren't as smooth. There might be sudden shifts, which makes it feel less controlled.

**Speaker 1:** Did the driver seem nervous to you?

**Speaker 2:** No, he didn't seem nervous. It felt like this was just his usual way of driving.

**Speaker 1:** Steering with one hand is not a very good driving habit. When he was merging onto the main road, did you feel there was any danger when a car passed by?

**Speaker 2:** No, I didn't feel there was any danger. When he was about to merge, I instinctively looked in that direction and felt the distance was safe.

**Speaker 1:** Did it feel like there was enough distance?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it felt normal.

**Speaker 1:** This part seems to be filmed in a residential area. How did you find it?

**Speaker 2:** It was quite good and smooth.

**Speaker 1:** Was there any line crossing when he was making a U-turn?

**Speaker 2:** I think there was a bit of line crossing. It seemed like he wanted to make the U-turn in one go but ended up crossing the line slightly. I didn't pay too much attention to it, though.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about his U-turn?

**Speaker 2:** If I were driving, I might have been a bit more cautious, especially with the right front wheel near the curb. It can be hard to judge sometimes.

**Speaker 1:** But how did the driver do?

**Speaker 2:** I think he did well. He seems to have been driving for a long time and has good judgment.

**Speaker 1:** So, you think he did a good job with the U-turn?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it was okay. If it were me, I might have been more cautious and possibly taken an extra maneuver to complete the turn.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel his turns were too sharp?

**Speaker 2:** No, the turns were fine, not too fast.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think making a U-turn in two moves is normal?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, especially if you're unsure about the road conditions. It's better to take your time and make sure you do it safely.

**Speaker 1:** Did he press the handle at any point?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, he did.
**Speaker 1:** So, you mentioned that you didn't pay much attention to others and focused on adjusting yourself. That's good.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. It's better to focus on your own driving.

**Speaker 1:** Did you press the handle again on the 30th? What happened?

**Speaker 2:** It was the 3rd. At that moment, it seemed like the driver accelerated suddenly, almost like a quick, sharp press on the pedal.

**Speaker 1:** Was it too fast? Did you feel it was dangerous?

**Speaker 2:** It was okay. I think with larger vehicles, it's best to either not overtake them or pass them quickly without lingering beside them. It was manageable. We were approaching a turn near a classic landmark.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel when you made the right turn at the entrance?

**Speaker 2:** By that time, I had already adapted.

**Speaker 1:** So, it felt normal?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, normal. In 300 meters, we were about to reach the landmark, then turn right at the traffic light. Did you press the handle again there?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I think so.

**Speaker 1:** Did you accidentally bump into something?

**Speaker 2:** No, it was just a sudden feeling of tension, so I pressed it.

**Speaker 1:** Why did you feel tense? Was it related to the driver's actions?

**Speaker 2:** It might have been the turn.

**Speaker 1:** Or was it because the road was bumpy?

**Speaker 2:** I think it was just the turn, not because of the road or other people.

**Speaker 1:** Was it because the turn was too fast and you felt worried?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, sometimes when I drive, I might take turns quickly too, but it doesn't feel as intense as when I'm a passenger. There's a sense of helplessness when you're not in control.

**Speaker 1:** Approaching the landmark, did you feel the driver was swerving left and right?

**Speaker 2:** I don't remember clearly, but sometimes it felt like the car was drifting a bit.

**Speaker 1:** Was it obvious?

**Speaker 2:** A little bit.

**Speaker 1:** Did it feel like the car might fly off the road?

**Speaker 2:** No, the left turn was quite normal. In 100 meters, we were about to reach the landmark and then turn left. Did you feel worried about the oncoming traffic?

**Speaker 1:** No, the road was quite wide.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, but I was a bit concerned if the large vehicle could make the turn.

**Speaker 1:** The left turn was normal, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, but the road felt bumpy.

**Speaker 1:** Did the driver slow down or control the speed?

**Speaker 2:** No, it was a bit uncomfortable. I pressed the handle again.
**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel any bumps?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I felt tense.

**Speaker 1:**
Did the driver slow down or control the speed? Did you feel uncomfortable? You pressed the handle again.

**Speaker 2:**
I was looking to the right, and suddenly the driver detected something. When I turned my head, I saw two people nearby.

**Speaker 1:**
In front of you, right? It felt a bit dangerous, didn't it?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because I wasn't looking at the driver. When he suddenly slowed down and I saw the people, it felt like we almost hit them.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think the driver should have slowed down or stopped to let the two people pass before continuing?

**Speaker 2:**
I think if the driver had been more attentive, we wouldn't have come so close. It was a bit tight, but slowing down allowed us to pass safely.

**Speaker 2:**
We are approaching the destination, and then we will turn.

**Speaker 1:**
Turning right near the fruit stand is normal. Please take the right lane and turn right at the traffic light. This is our world.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, turning right will bring us to the destination.

**Speaker 1:**
The right turn felt a bit slow.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was better that way.

**Speaker 1:**
We are about to reach the destination.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel a bit behind?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I pressed the handle a bit later because it seemed like the driver wasn't following the navigation and almost missed the turn.

**Speaker 1:**
You mean at the intersection?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, he missed the right turn and stopped for a moment. I was thinking about the next ride.

**Speaker 1:**
After the right turn, did you feel any bumps?

**Speaker 2:**
I don't remember clearly, but if there were, it might have been due to the road conditions.

**Speaker 1:**
It felt normal. Did you notice how close we were to the curb?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was okay.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you see any pedestrians? Were you worried? Did you think the road was wide enough for us to pass, or was the driver going too slow?

**Speaker 2:**
I felt that after driving for a while, I got a sense of the car's space, and it seemed fine.

**Speaker 1:**
We are approaching the next turn. Is the driver going fast?

**Speaker 1:**
The left turn felt normal. In 100 meters, we will reach the traffic light. The driver seemed to be braking the whole time.

**Speaker 2:**
It felt normal. It wasn't the best, but it was okay.

**Speaker 1:**
We are about to reach the destination. After the right turn, we will continue to the end of the road and turn right again.

**Speaker 1:**
The left lane. The right turn felt normal. Did you think the turn was too wide? We arrived directly.
**Speaker 1:** After turning right at the end of the road, continue to turn right on the road.

**Speaker 1:** Did you notice the car on the left? Was the right turn normal, or did it seem a bit wide?

**Speaker 2:** No, it seemed fine to me. I checked behind and there were no issues. If the navigation indicates a left turn, it should be fine for everyone.

**Speaker 1:** At the traffic light, did the car accelerate smoothly or was it a bit abrupt?

**Speaker 2:** It was quite smooth, like a typical taxi ride. No issues there.

**Speaker 1:** Continue for 200 meters and then turn right. Do you usually take taxis for your trips?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I usually book taxis using my phone.

**Speaker 1:** How did you find the U-turn here? It seems quite complex.

**Speaker 2:** As long as you don't drive too fast, it should be fine. The other cars won't be an issue.

**Speaker 1:** It seems the driver handled it well.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, he drove slowly and carefully.

**Speaker 1:** When he returned to the service area, did he drive in the correct lane?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't really notice, but I think he did.

**Speaker 1:** Did he drive with one hand the whole time?

**Speaker 2:** From what I saw, he did use one hand, but I'm not sure about the rest of the time.

**Speaker 1:** I'll review other videos later. For now, let's focus on what we have.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about the parking?

**Speaker 2:** During parking, he did bump into something behind, but it wasn't a big deal.

**Speaker 1:** There might be more that we haven't covered. Besides the marked scenarios, did you notice any dangerous maneuvers by the driver?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't pay much attention to the driver's actions, but nothing stood out as particularly dangerous.

**Speaker 1:** It doesn't have to be hand movements; it could be anything noticeable in the driving.

**Speaker 2:** There was one instance where he tried to overtake a large vehicle on the right. He seemed to steer left first before checking the mirror. It felt like he should have checked the mirror first. His reaction was a bit delayed, but other than that and the one-handed driving, everything seemed fine.

**Speaker 1:** Overall, what do you think makes driving safer?

**Speaker 2:** Safety comes from following the key points we learned when getting our driver's license. It's important to stick to these rules consistently and not become complacent over time. Always adhere to the fundamental safety guidelines.
**Speaker 1:** Have you ever felt unsafe while taking a taxi?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, there was one time. I wasn't very happy because I hadn't completely gotten out of the car, and the driver started moving forward. Also, if something bad happens, some drivers will speed up and open the window to talk to me. Sometimes, taxi drivers, even when there are fewer cars, will still be late or send messages.

**Speaker 1:** Besides the situations marked by the handle, have you noticed any other actions by the driver that made you feel uncomfortable, either psychologically or physically?

**Speaker 2:** Mainly psychological discomfort. For instance, if it's raining a bit and I haven't rested well, it can be unsettling.

**Speaker 1:** Did the driver make sharp turns?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, if I'm focused on the comfort of the ride or other aspects, it could be better. But it's not necessarily wrong; it might just be a habit. Sometimes, you don't notice it at first.

**Speaker 1:** So, the driver didn't intentionally take care of the passenger's experience?

**Speaker 2:** Exactly.

**Speaker 1:** Do you get car sick often?

**Speaker 2:** I used to when I was younger, but not much now. Other factors like lack of sleep or not feeling well physically can contribute. Also, if the driver is not good with manual transmission, constantly accelerating and braking, it can make me feel car sick.

**Speaker 1:** What do you think makes a car ride more comfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Sometimes, it's about not pursuing acceleration too aggressively. The acceleration and deceleration should be smooth.

**Speaker 2:** Also, sometimes drivers can be tense on the road.

**Speaker 1:** Is that all? What actions by the driver make you uncomfortable when taking a taxi or riding in someone else's car?

**Speaker 2:** Some drivers smoke, which affects the environment. Others might make phone calls or send voice messages.

**Speaker 1:** So, they are not focused?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, and I also dislike drivers who talk too much. They keep chatting, and it makes me think too much.

**Speaker 1:** In terms of driving...
**Speaker 1:**
So, in terms of driving, what are your thoughts?

**Speaker 2:**
When it comes to driving, one thing that really bothers me is when people run red or yellow lights, especially when they're in a rush. It can be very dangerous.

**Speaker 2:**
Some drivers are very familiar with the roads and know where there are no surveillance cameras. They might cross the line or take risks in those areas. These are the main issues I see.

**Speaker 1:**
I see. What do you think makes a good driver?

**Speaker 2:**
First and foremost, a good driver prioritizes safety. Whether it's overtaking or maintaining speed, it's important to stay within acceptable limits and be aware of all aspects of driving. If it's not too difficult to manage, it should be acceptable.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you consider yourself an experienced driver or a novice?

**Speaker 2:**
I always consider myself a novice driver. Even though I've been driving for a while, especially at school and occasionally at home, I still feel like I have a lot to learn.

**Speaker 1:**
You seem to be very safety-conscious.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I also think about my hometown and the driving tests like the theory test, practical test, and advanced driving tests. 

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think is the biggest difference between you and an experienced driver?

**Speaker 2:**
Since I learned to drive with a manual transmission, I think the biggest difference is the skill and proficiency in handling the car, like shifting gears smoothly. Experienced drivers are very skilled in these areas. Another aspect is spatial awareness, like judging the distance between cars.

**Speaker 1:**
When you mention spatial awareness, do you mean the distance between vehicles?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. It's about judging the distance from the driver's seat to the front right or the side. Also, confidence plays a role. I prefer to stay cautious, as many accidents involve overconfident experienced drivers.

**Speaker 1:**
Have you ever looked into autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I have.

**Speaker 1:**
Have you ever experienced it?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I haven't.

**Speaker 1:**
What aspects do you think autonomous driving can never replicate compared to human drivers?

**Speaker 2:**
There are certain decisions that autonomous driving systems might struggle with, like making judgment calls in complex situations. For example, if there are two possible actions, the system might not know which one to choose. Autonomous driving is more reliable at lower speeds, but at higher speeds, like on highways, it still has limitations.
**Speaker 1:** So, do you think the recent trip was driven by the driver or was it on autopilot?

**Speaker 2:** I felt it was the driver.

**Speaker 1:** Why do you think it was the driver?

**Speaker 2:** It seemed like it because the driver was constantly making adjustments, especially on the left side.

**Speaker 1:** So, you felt the car's movements were in sync with the driver's actions, making it seem like a person was controlling the car. If we assume the car was on autopilot and the driver was just a safety monitor, how would that compare to your usual experience as a passenger?

**Speaker 2:** If that were the case, I think the autopilot would handle most of the driving, and the person would only intervene when necessary.

**Speaker 1:** What details would make you think the car was on autopilot?

**Speaker 2:** Firstly, it wouldn't cross lane lines or make abrupt moves. It would be more sensitive to pedestrians and surrounding objects, reacting more cautiously by slowing down and assessing the situation before making decisions.

**Speaker 1:** So, you're saying that if it were on autopilot, it would avoid crossing lane lines, be more sensitive to pedestrians, and slow down in advance. But today, the driver did exhibit these behaviors.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I noticed that. It made me wonder if it was on autopilot, but I couldn't be sure.

**Speaker 1:** So, you couldn't determine if it was the driver or the autopilot?

**Speaker 2:** Exactly, I couldn't tell.

**Speaker 1:** Lastly, as a pedestrian, how do you judge the intentions of oncoming vehicles at an intersection without traffic lights?

**Speaker 2:** I look to see if the driver is making eye contact or if the car is slowing down, indicating they are aware of my presence and intend to let me cross.
**Speaker 1:**
For example, if you are approaching an intersection without traffic lights, how do you determine the intentions of the oncoming vehicles?

**Speaker 2:**
I usually look for any signs of deceleration. If a driver is slowing down, I can infer that they might be yielding to pedestrians. Then, I observe if they come to a complete stop. Some drivers might only slow down at the intersection to ensure safety. In such cases, I wait. I might inch forward slightly to test the waters and see if they are indeed yielding. If they make a clear gesture to let me pass, then I proceed to cross the road.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it depends on whether the driver yields to you, right? You look for an opportunity to cross.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, especially when there are many cars. If there are fewer cars, I judge by their speed. If a car is moving fast, I assume they won't stop, and if I can cross safely, I do so quickly.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, let me check if there are any more questions. No, that's all. Thank you for participating in our experiment today. That concludes our session.
