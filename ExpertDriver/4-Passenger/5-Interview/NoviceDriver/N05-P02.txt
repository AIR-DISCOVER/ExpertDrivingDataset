**Speaker 1:**
Let's start by asking a few questions about your usual travel habits. Do you often travel by car? How often?

**Speaker 2:**
About three times a week.

**Speaker 1:**
Three times a week, is it usually for long trips or short trips? How long do these short trips usually take?

**Speaker 2:**
About half an hour to an hour.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you find the car today? Was it good?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was quite good and stable.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you rate the driver's skills?

**Speaker 2:**
The driver was quite good as well. If you had a choice, what type of car would you prefer for traveling? For example, an SUV, a gasoline car, or an electric car?

**Speaker 2:**
I prefer gasoline cars.

**Speaker 1:**
Why is that?

**Speaker 2:**
Because electric cars accelerate and decelerate too abruptly.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it's too abrupt?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, gasoline cars have smoother acceleration.

**Speaker 1:**
Smoother.

**Speaker 2:**
It also depends on the driver's driving habits.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you drive yourself? Do you have a driver's license?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I have a license, but I haven't driven for two or three years.

**Speaker 1:**
Two or three years. Now, let's watch this video and review today's experiment. I'll ask you about your feelings during certain maneuvers, like turning or U-turns. Feel free to share any thoughts you have about your experience, whether it was particularly good or bad. Let's start. How did you feel about the turning process?

**Speaker 2:**
It was good, quite safe, and there were no dangerous moments.

**Speaker 1:**
What about comfort?

**Speaker 2:**
It was stable, and the turning speed wasn't fast.

**Speaker 1:**
Not fast. This is a turning and merging process. How did you feel about it?

**Speaker 2:**
It was a normal turn, nothing unreasonable.

**Speaker 1:**
And merging onto the main road, how did you feel about that?

**Speaker 2:**
No issues.

**Speaker 1:**
Did the driver stop for a long time during the U-turn?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, a bit long.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about the U-turn?

**Speaker 2:**
It felt a bit dangerous.

**Speaker 1:**
Dangerous?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because a large truck was blocking the view, so it was hard to see if there were any oncoming vehicles.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
No, that's all.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you were worried the driver couldn't see the road behind clearly, which might cause safety issues?
**Speaker 1:**
Did you notice any issues with the road conditions?

**Speaker 2:**
No, nothing else.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you were concerned that the driver might not see the road behind clearly, which could pose a safety risk. Is that correct?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's right. After the driver adjusted, it was a straight acceleration process. How did you feel about that?

**Speaker 1:**
It felt normal.

**Speaker 2:**
No issues? It felt quite normal. Do you think the steady speed during the straight acceleration was comfortable?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, it felt normal. How did you feel about the speed today?

**Speaker 2:**
It was consistent, not too fast.

**Speaker 1:**
There was an intersection without traffic lights. How did you feel when the driver passed through it?

**Speaker 2:**
It felt normal.

**Speaker 1:**
Did the driver honk the horn?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't hear any honking.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you notice any dangerous maneuvers by the driver during the trip?

**Speaker 2:**
No, apart from what we discussed earlier. How do you think the driving could be made safer?

**Speaker 1:**
The road conditions were good. I think the driver did a great job. I couldn't have driven better myself.

**Speaker 2:**
So, you're satisfied with the driver's performance. When you usually ride with others, are there any behaviors that make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 1:**
Sudden lane changes.

**Speaker 2:**
Anything else?

**Speaker 1:**
No, that's about it.

**Speaker 2:**
Other than the scenarios we discussed, did you notice anything else that made you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 1:**
No, not really.

**Speaker 2:**
What could make the driving experience more comfortable for you?

**Speaker 1:**
Smoother acceleration and deceleration.

**Speaker 2:**
And controlling the speed well during turns to avoid feeling dizzy.

**Speaker 1:**
So, if today's driver had smoother acceleration and deceleration, your experience would have been better?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but today was already very good. When riding with others, what makes you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 1:**
Sudden braking and lane changes.

**Speaker 2:**
Long honking.

**Speaker 1:**
What makes a good driver in your opinion?
**Speaker 1:** The other car suddenly braked hard and then changed lanes abruptly.

**Speaker 1:** I honked the horn for a long time.

**Speaker 1:** What do you think makes a good driver? What qualities should a professional driver have?

**Speaker 2:** In terms of driving skills, a good driver should be steady and cautious.

**Speaker 1:** What do you mean by steady and cautious specifically?

**Speaker 2:** Specifically, it means controlling the acceleration and deceleration smoothly. Being cautious means avoiding sudden braking in complex road conditions. Also, maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles is crucial.

**Speaker 1:** So, you mean keeping a safe distance? Is that right? Anything else? What do you think is the biggest difference between an experienced driver and a novice driver?

**Speaker 2:** The biggest difference is in speed control and understanding the dimensions of the car. Novice drivers don't have as good a grasp on these aspects as experienced drivers do.

**Speaker 1:** What do you mean by understanding the dimensions?

**Speaker 2:** It's about having a good sense of distance. For example, when making a U-turn, a novice might not turn the steering wheel correctly and may need to reverse to adjust. Also, their control over acceleration and deceleration might not be as smooth.

**Speaker 1:** Poor control over acceleration and deceleration.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, which can make passengers feel unsafe.

**Speaker 1:** Now, regarding autonomous driving, what aspects do you think autonomous cars can never match human drivers?

**Speaker 2:** Technically, I believe that once autonomous driving technology reaches a certain level, it will be better than human driving. However, in unexpected situations, like when an accident is imminent, how the autonomous system handles it is still questionable.

**Speaker 1:** You mean how it handles the situation after an accident has occurred?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, for example, if a collision with another car is unavoidable, should the system brake and prepare for the impact or change lanes to transfer the risk to another lane?

**Speaker 1:** There are still some doubts in this area. Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** Another issue is the legal responsibility in case of an accident involving an autonomous car. How is liability determined?

**Speaker 1:** Legal issues, right. Anything else? No? Do you think the car we just rode in was driven by a human or was it an autonomous car?

**Speaker 2:** It felt like it was driven by a human. Why?

**Speaker 2:** Because I saw someone in the front seat.

**Speaker 1:** If we assume the car was autonomous and the driver was just sitting there, would your experience have been different?
**Speaker 1:**
The car is self-driving, and the driver is just sitting there. Can you recall if there was anything different about your experience with the new car? Let's assume you know this car is mid-priced and you took a ride around. How would your feelings compare to what you just experienced?

**Speaker 2:**
Hmm, it might be different.

**Speaker 1:**
How so?

**Speaker 2:**
Well, since it's not common to ride in a self-driving car, and it was my first time, I felt a bit nervous and concerned about safety.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, it's your first time in a self-driving car, so you were worried about safety. Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
Not much else, maybe just getting used to it. It felt strange to see the driver's seat empty.

**Speaker 1:**
So, there was no one in the driver's seat.

**Speaker 1:**
During your experience, was there any moment when you questioned whether the car was actually self-driving? Did you have such a moment?

**Speaker 2:**
When you didn't mention it was self-driving, I didn't feel like it was driven by a person. But after you mentioned it, I noticed the turns were very precise. It didn't feel like a human was driving, who might cut corners or drive over the bike lane. The car made very accurate turns, staying in the middle of the lane before turning.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you recall a specific moment when you noticed the precise turning?

**Speaker 2:**
Basically, every turn.

**Speaker 1:**
Let's focus on one instance.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly, like those turns.

**Speaker 1:**
You felt the turning process was very standard, without crossing into the bike lane or over the lines. It stayed in the middle.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, and if a human driver, especially an experienced one, was driving, it could also be very smooth.

**Speaker 1:**
One last question: If you were a pedestrian, not a passenger, and you were crossing an intersection without traffic lights, how would you judge the car or driver's intentions? How do you determine the intentions of vehicles or non-motorized traffic when crossing the street?

**Speaker 2:**
I would look at whether the car is slowing down and also check the turn signals.

**Speaker 1:**
So, the turn signals, right? Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
And whether the car shows any intention to slow down.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you notice that intention? By watching the car?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, if the car doesn't slow down, I wait for it to pass. If it reduces speed, then I cross the street.

**Speaker 1:**
So, if it clearly slows down, you cross. If not, you let it pass first.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes.
**Speaker 1:**
If the car had slowed down, I would have crossed the street.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, if it had clearly slowed down, I would have crossed. If it didn't slow down, I would have let it pass first. We've almost finished our questions. Lastly, I want to ask, was there any part of the experience that left a strong impression on you, whether good or bad?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, throughout the entire process, I felt the driver was very steady. There were no dangerous moments; everything was handled very well.

**Speaker 2:**
Great, that concludes our interview for today. Thank you for your cooperation.

**Speaker 1:**
Was the driver using an autonomous driving system or was it a human driver?

**Speaker 2:**
It was definitely a human driver.

**Speaker 1:**
No way! Haha, you're kidding.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the driver was a professional, and it was clear from the start of the interview.
