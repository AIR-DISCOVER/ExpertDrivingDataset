**Speaker 1:**
This is where we pressed the button, right? Is this on the way back?

**Speaker 2:**
I don't think so. When we were approaching the parking lot, I didn't press it, right? Hmm, this one.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you remember if you pressed it lightly or not?

**Speaker 2:**
Very lightly, very lightly.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, let me first check if our online partners can hear us clearly. Can you hear us clearly? Online partners, you can also speak up if you can hear him.

**Speaker 1:**
Hmm, could you say something? I want to check if the microphone is working.

**Speaker 2:**
Hmm, can you hear me? Yes, OK, great.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, let's get started. I'll introduce myself again. I am a researcher at the Intelligent Industry Research Institute, conducting this interview. Today, I will be interviewing you as a passenger. Let's start with some warm-up questions. Do you often take rides?

**Speaker 2:**
Not very often, just occasionally.

**Speaker 1:**
On average, how often?

**Speaker 2:**
On average?

**Speaker 1:**
Frequency? Yes.

**Speaker 2:**
At most once or twice a month.

**Speaker 1:**
What usually prompts you to take a ride?

**Speaker 2:**
Hmm, taking a ride for what purpose? For example, during my internship or when moving dorms, or going home.

**Speaker 1:**
How long does it usually take?

**Speaker 2:**
Hmm, going home is quite far, almost an hour.

**Speaker 1:**
Hmm, and now about your experience today. Overall, how did you feel about today's ride?

**Speaker 2:**
It felt pretty good. The driver drove very smoothly. Hmm, the only thing is that the car's space was a bit small, but everything else was fine.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think about the driver's driving skills?

**Speaker 2:**
I think they were pretty good. Why? Because the ride was stable, and the speed wasn't too fast, probably due to the road conditions.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you consider fast?

**Speaker 2:**
Maybe on the highway. Hmm, but it seemed like going over 110 km/h was already too fast.

**Speaker 1:**
Compared to the highway, city driving is slower. How does this driver compare to your usual drivers?

**Speaker 2:**
Usually, they don't drive very fast either, just average.

**Speaker 1:**
What mode of transportation do you use most often?

**Speaker 2:**
I take the subway the most.

**Speaker 1:**
Have you ever taken an autonomous vehicle, like the ones from Baidu in Yizhuang?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, back in school, we went to Xiong'an New Area and took an autonomous vehicle in the park. It was quite slow, but it felt very safe.

**Speaker 1:**
And then...
Speaker 1: So, you mentioned you tried autonomous driving in a park area. How did that feel?

Speaker 2: It was quite slow, but it felt safe since it was within the park.

Speaker 1: If you had to choose, what type of car would you prefer for travel? For example, an SUV, a gasoline car, an electric car, a sedan, or a hybrid?

Speaker 2: I would choose a regular gasoline car or an electric car because they are more common.

Speaker 1: Do you drive often?

Speaker 2: Not really, mainly because we don't have a car at home.

Speaker 1: Do you have a driver's license?

Speaker 2: Yes, I got it after graduating from high school.

Speaker 1: How long ago was that?

Speaker 2: I got it in 2018, so it's been several years now.

Speaker 1: About five years then. Now, let's move on to the next part. We'll watch a video from a dashcam perspective, and I'll ask you some questions. If you recall any safety concerns or felt uncomfortable at any point, feel free to mention them.

Speaker 1: For example, Beijing roads are quite narrow and crowded. How did you feel about the car parked in the middle of the road, like that taxi?

Speaker 2: It shouldn't be parked there. 

Speaker 1: Did you feel unsafe or just find it typical?

Speaker 2: It's quite common, so I didn't feel particularly unsafe. As a driver, I might be more concerned, but as a passenger, it didn't bother me much.

Speaker 1: What about the bicycle that was going against traffic? Did that make you feel uneasy?

Speaker 2: Not really, because it was quite far from us.

Speaker 1: And how did you feel about the narrow gaps between cars?

Speaker 2: As a passenger, I didn't feel threatened.

Speaker 1: There was a moment when the car accelerated slightly in a designated area. How did you feel about that?

Speaker 2: It felt normal because there weren't many cars around.

Speaker 1: So, your judgment is based on the surrounding traffic conditions?

Speaker 2: Yes, especially after making a U-turn, a slight acceleration seemed appropriate.
Speaker 1: Were there many cars around?

Speaker 2: Not really, there weren't many cars nearby.

Speaker 1: So, your judgment was based on the fact that there weren't many cars around?

Speaker 2: Yes, it was after making a U-turn. I felt a sudden breeze, probably from the car's air conditioning.

Speaker 1: So, the air conditioning blew on you right after the U-turn?

Speaker 2: Yes, it seemed to be the angle or something, and it happened suddenly.

Speaker 1: So, your discomfort was due to the sudden change in temperature right after the U-turn. Where did the breeze come from?

Speaker 2: From the left rear side.

Speaker 1: Was the car window closed at that time?

Speaker 2: Yes, it was.

Speaker 1: Did you feel the driver was driving too slowly, at a moderate speed, or too fast?

Speaker 2: Moderate speed.

Speaker 1: When we made a right turn, did you feel anything in particular?

Speaker 2: No, nothing special. Why?

Speaker 1: Because the turn seemed quite normal to you?

Speaker 2: Yes, it was just a regular turn.

Speaker 1: As a passenger, how did you feel when we passed another car?

Speaker 2: I did notice it, but it wasn't a big deal.

Speaker 1: Did you hear a long V1 sound? Why did it bother you?

Speaker 2: Yes, it sounded like noise and was quite uncomfortable.

Speaker 1: So, the noise was bothersome, but it didn't affect your physical comfort while driving?

Speaker 2: Yes, it was just too loud.

Speaker 1: During the right turn, what were your feelings as a passenger?

Speaker 2: I was a bit worried because there was an electric bike ahead, and the light was green for them too.

Speaker 1: Where exactly was the bike?

Speaker 2: It was a bit ahead, close to the car.

Speaker 1: So, you were worried about the bike and the car colliding?

Speaker 2: Yes, because the bike could go straight as well.

Speaker 1: What would be the consequence of going straight?

Speaker 2: It could crash into the blue car in front.

Speaker 1: Did you notice the bicycle at that time?

Speaker 2: Yes, but I didn't think it was a big issue.

Speaker 1: There was also a delivery person nearby. Did you notice them?

Speaker 2: No, I didn't.

Speaker 1: How did you feel when the car overtook another vehicle?

Speaker 2: I didn't feel much because there were no oncoming cars.

Speaker 1: In Beijing, it's common to see pedestrians walking against traffic. Did you notice that?
**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about that overtaking maneuver?

**Speaker 2:** At that moment, I didn't feel much because there were no oncoming cars.

**Speaker 1:** In Beijing, it's common to see pedestrians walking against traffic. Did you notice any pedestrians, and how did you feel about it?

**Speaker 2:** Not really. There were no pedestrians close by, so I felt it was safe.

**Speaker 1:** There was a left turn just now, and another car was involved.

**Speaker 2:** I noticed the car on the left wanted to go straight. I was wondering who should go first. But since our lane was slightly ahead, I didn't think there would be any accidents.

**Speaker 1:** Are you used to seeing cars on both sides? What about pedestrians? There were many manhole covers on the road; did you notice them?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't feel like there was any danger.

**Speaker 1:** There was a person with a trash can. Did you notice that?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, but I didn't pay much attention.

**Speaker 1:** There was also a right turn. Did you feel any discomfort, especially since you didn't have to wait for the traffic light?

**Speaker 2:** No, I didn't feel any discomfort.

**Speaker 1:** There was a bicycle very close to the main road. Did you notice it?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I did. But I didn't feel uncomfortable because I thought we wouldn't collide.

**Speaker 1:** There was another right turn, and the oncoming traffic was quite close. How did you feel about that?

**Speaker 2:** It felt normal because the road was narrow, and we were driving slowly.

**Speaker 1:** The road was narrow, and each car had to give way. How did you feel about that?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't feel uncomfortable because the speed was slow.

**Speaker 1:** There was a fast delivery vehicle. How did you feel about that?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't pay much attention to it.

**Speaker 1:** There was a left turn without a traffic signal. How did you feel about that?

**Speaker 2:** I noticed there were no signals, but the car waited for the other two cars to pass before turning, so it felt safe.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about waiting at the red light with other cars around?

**Speaker 2:** It didn't affect me.

**Speaker 1:** There was a right turn followed by a series of lane changes. How did you feel about that?

**Speaker 2:** The turn was smooth because the speed was controlled.
**Speaker 1:**  
There was a nationwide pandemic.

**Speaker 2:**  
That didn't affect me.

**Speaker 1:**  
I have a scenario here involving a right turn followed by a series of lane changes. How did your car handle that?

**Speaker 2:**  
First of all, the turn was taken at a relatively slow speed, and considering the road conditions, there weren't many cars around, so it didn't feel dangerous.

**Speaker 1:**  
Then there was a U-turn directly into the service road. How did you feel about that?

**Speaker 2:**  
I felt a bit concerned because there were quite a few cars around, and I was slightly worried about making a sudden move.

**Speaker 1:**  
In scenarios like that, what specifically worries you about the surrounding objects?

**Speaker 2:**  
I understand. For instance, there was a bicycle ahead that I was worried might scrape against the car I was in.

**Speaker 1:**  
There were also many vehicles going the wrong way nearby.

**Speaker 2:**  
That didn't affect me much.

**Speaker 2:**  
You mentioned earlier that you honked several times during the U-turn. Why was that?

**Speaker 1:**  
Yes, after the U-turn, you honked multiple times. Can you explain why?

**Speaker 1:**  
Also, there was another instance where you honked at an intersection. Do you remember which one?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, at the intersection. I remember honking there.

**Speaker 1:**  
So, besides these instances where you used the horn, did you feel there were any other dangerous maneuvers by the driver or the vehicle?

**Speaker 2:**  
No, overall, I felt it was quite safe.

**Speaker 1:**  
Why do you think that is?

**Speaker 2:**  
I believe the likelihood of a traffic accident was relatively low. Subconsciously, I felt that way. Additionally, the car wasn't moving very fast, and there weren't many vehicles on the road, so the safety factor seemed high.

**Speaker 1:**  
Would you be more concerned if the car was moving faster?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, and if there was more traffic, I would feel less comfortable. For instance, on a one-way street, if there were continuous oncoming vehicles, I would feel more anxious.

**Speaker 1:**  
Why is that?

**Speaker 2:**  
Because without other cars, it feels safer.
**Speaker 1:** If there are continuous vehicles coming from the opposite direction, it might feel a bit...

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. Why? Because if there's no car or just one car, the distance between it and other objects is relatively large, so there won't be any collisions. But if there are many cars, the probability of a collision increases.

**Speaker 1:** So, if there are many cars, you feel the likelihood of a collision is higher. When you usually ride in someone else's car, besides the driver being aggressive, what other behaviors do you find dangerous?

**Speaker 2:** Dangerous operations? No, not really.

**Speaker 1:** What do you think makes driving safer or makes you feel safe?

**Speaker 2:** For example, in situations like turning or making a U-turn, driving at a slower speed feels safer.

**Speaker 1:** Turning and U-turns, right. But you mentioned before that you once rode in an autonomous car from Baidu. It was too slow, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it was too slow. That was in a park, and there were hardly any cars around, yet it was still very slow.

**Speaker 1:** Because the car itself was set to drive slowly?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it seems like the car's settings were just slow.

**Speaker 1:** When you usually ride in someone else's car, what driver behaviors make you feel unsafe? What kind of driving makes you feel unsafe inside or outside the car?

**Speaker 2:** If the driver is aggressive, it makes me feel unsafe.

**Speaker 1:** Besides the driver, what about the vehicle itself? Does the price of the vehicle matter?

**Speaker 2:** If the vehicle is large, it can feel a bit unsafe.

**Speaker 1:** Large vehicles like trucks, buses, or SUVs. Besides that, what driving behaviors make you feel unsafe from a passenger's perspective?

**Speaker 2:** Driving too fast.

**Speaker 1:** Regarding the surrounding environment, what scenarios make you feel uncomfortable or threatened? What makes you anxious or nervous?

**Speaker 2:** I might get car sick. Also, pedestrians crossing the road without traffic lights can be very dangerous. I've encountered such situations before.

**Speaker 1:** So, seeing pedestrians crossing the road while you're in the car makes you anxious and nervous?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it makes me feel uneasy.

**Speaker 1:** Besides pedestrians, what about fast-moving electric bikes on the roadside? Do they make you feel unsafe, especially with delivery drivers who often ride fast?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, they can feel threatening.

**Speaker 1:** Do you feel more threatened by them?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, especially when they are riding against traffic.
**Speaker 1:**
So, do you think you would feel threatened or...?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it would feel more threatening.

**Speaker 1:**
A little? Is it more dangerous to drive against traffic or...?

**Speaker 2:**
Driving against traffic is more dangerous.

**Speaker 1:**
Okay, and during this ride, did you feel that the driver or the vehicle did anything that made you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
No, overall, the experience was quite good.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you were satisfied with the ride experience. Right. And you didn't notice any uncomfortable maneuvers. In your usual commutes, what situations make you feel uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
One thing is the driver themselves. Some drivers get easily agitated. Also, I feel safer on highways compared to regular roads or side roads. Side roads tend to have more complex conditions, like pedestrian crossings where cars might stop, or many parked cars. The road conditions are more complicated compared to highways.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you feel more uncomfortable on roads with complex conditions. Right. You mentioned that an agitated driver can affect your comfort. Do you think this would happen with autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:**
Autonomous driving should not have this issue.

**Speaker 1:**
Why? Do you think the vehicle won't get agitated?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, subconsciously, I believe that.

**Speaker 1:**
When you ride in someone else's car, what kind of driving behavior makes you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
As I mentioned, the driver's behavior and the road conditions. There's nothing specific about the vehicle itself.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think makes a good driver?

**Speaker 2:**
First, they should follow traffic rules. Secondly...

**Speaker 1:**
What does it mean to not follow the rules? Can you give an example?

**Speaker 2:**
For instance, not slowing down at intersections.

**Speaker 1:**
Right, intersections should be approached slowly. Just now...

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
So, a good driver should follow these rules. What else makes a driver professional in your opinion?

**Speaker 2:**
They should be able to anticipate certain situations.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel that today's driver had good anticipation?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't notice it much, but the driving was quite good.

**Speaker 1:**
What other standards do you think represent a professional driver? At least, what should they achieve?

**Speaker 2:**
They should follow traffic rules, be courteous to pedestrians, and try to avoid accidents.

**Speaker 1:**
If one day you meet a driver and think, "Wow, this driver is so professional and skilled," what would make you feel that way?
**Speaker 1:**
You mentioned that one should always be mindful of yielding to pedestrians and try to avoid traffic accidents. Let's assume that.

**Speaker 1:**
One day, you encounter a driver and think, "Wow, this driver is really professional and skilled." Why do you think that is?

**Speaker 2:**
It's probably because the driver operates the car smoothly. It might also be related to the quality of the car. If a car has good performance, the comfort level for the passengers will be higher.

**Speaker 1:**
For example, if I have a very good car, do you think an ordinary driver and a professional driver would drive it similarly?

**Speaker 2:**
It still depends on their level of experience—whether they have driven such a car before and for how long.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it's about experience?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it's about how long they've been driving.

**Speaker 1:**
In what aspects do you think this experience and professionalism manifest?

**Speaker 2:**
In their ability to anticipate road conditions and their history of avoiding accidents.

**Speaker 1:**
Historical data. You previously worked on an autonomous driving car in a park. Did you find it professional?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I did. Although it was my first time working on it, I found it quite professional.

**Speaker 1:**
Okay. What do you think is the biggest difference between an experienced driver and a novice driver?

**Speaker 2:**
It's their mindset. New drivers tend to get nervous easily. Experienced drivers, having driven more, are more familiar with the routes and have a better overall grasp of the environment compared to novices.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you mean by "overall grasp"? How does it manifest?

**Speaker 2:**
It means they are more aware of the number of pedestrians, non-motorized vehicles, and the likelihood of encountering situations like wrong-way drivers. They have a better understanding of these factors. New drivers, on the other hand, might be driving on a route for the first time or only a few times and won't have the same level of psychological preparedness.

**Speaker 1:**
Here's a question: What aspects do you think autonomous cars cannot achieve compared to human drivers?

**Speaker 2:**
In terms of historical experience.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you believe in the future of autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:**
I believe in it, but I don't think it will be widely adopted in China anytime soon. China is very large, and while there might be some experimental zones in highly developed cities, the cost of autonomous cars is high. Additionally, there are already many vehicles on the road, so updating them would be an issue.

**Speaker 1:**
Updating?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, if we switch to autonomous driving, we need to consider the existing vehicles.

**Speaker 1:**
Oh, you mean if I have a car, converting it to autonomous driving would be very costly?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. Besides the cost, are there any other aspects where you think autonomous driving falls short?
**Speaker 1:** I want to switch to autonomous driving, but the cost is very high.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I understand. Besides the cost and policy aspects, do you think there are any other areas where autonomous driving might not be as reliable as human driving?

**Speaker 1:** I believe that from a technical standpoint, autonomous driving could potentially be achieved in the next 10 years, whether in the East or globally. But are there any scenarios where you think autonomous driving will never be able to match human judgment?

**Speaker 2:** I think it comes down to human psychology. If people don't have enough understanding of autonomous driving technology, they might subconsciously feel it's not very safe. Even if they are familiar with the technology, there could still be some perceived risks.

**Speaker 1:** I have a question. Do you think the car you just rode in was driven by a human or was it fully autonomous? In the past, I don't know if the cars you rode in the park had safety drivers. Even in Baidu's autonomous cars, there is usually a safety driver holding the steering wheel to ensure nothing goes wrong. So, do you think today's ride was driven by a human, autonomous, or a mix of both?

**Speaker 2:** Was it driven by a human? Why do you ask?

**Speaker 1:** Because we didn't tell you from the start. Do you think it was driven by a human because there was someone holding the steering wheel and following the navigation?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, subconsciously, I felt that since there was a person sitting there, it must be a human driving. He was controlling the steering wheel and following the navigation.

**Speaker 1:** So, you think it was a human driving because someone was holding the steering wheel, looking at the navigation, and turning their head. If we remove these factors, do you think it could have been autonomous?

**Speaker 2:** It's a bit unclear.

**Speaker 1:** For example, today's driver, you might not have noticed from the back, but he was only using one hand. If we remove these factors, do you think there was a possibility of autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't feel it.

**Speaker 1:** Was it because the driving felt too natural? Why didn't you feel it?

**Speaker 2:** It felt just like usual.

**Speaker 1:** Nothing unusual, right? How does it compare to the time you rode in the campus?

**Speaker 2:** The campus ride was more consistent and the speed was very slow. This time, there were speed changes. Why do you think that is?

**Speaker 1:** Why do you think that is?

**Speaker 2:** This time, it felt different. Firstly, I knew the campus ride was autonomous, and the experience was very different. Secondly, today's ride felt similar to a regular taxi or a private car.

**Speaker 1:** If the driver was pretending to drive, do you think the experience would be different from usual?

**Speaker 2:** If I knew he was pretending...

**Speaker 1:** Let's assume the driver was just pretending to drive. Do you think the experience would be different from usual?
**Speaker 1:**
Let's assume that the person we mentioned earlier was just pretending to drive. How do you think this would differ from your usual driving experience?

**Speaker 2:**
If you had told me beforehand...

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, if I told you now.

**Speaker 2:**
Thinking back, it feels the same as when a person is actually driving.

**Speaker 1:**
Right, it feels the same. So, if I told you he wasn't really driving, you wouldn't notice any specific details that would make you think otherwise. Okay, let's move on to the next question. Imagine you're a pedestrian at a complex intersection without traffic signals. How do you judge the intentions of non-motorized vehicles and cars to decide whether to cross or not?

**Speaker 2:**
I look at their direction and movement. They usually have a clear path they're following.

**Speaker 1:**
In what situations do you decide to cross? How do you judge whether to let the car go first or if you should go first when there are no traffic signals?

**Speaker 2:**
In such cases, I usually let the car go first. If a car and I arrive at the crossing at the same time, I look at the driver. They might signal for me to go first, or there might be some form of communication.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you wait for the driver to signal you to go. But what if the cars keep coming continuously?

**Speaker 2:**
If the cars keep coming non-stop...

**Speaker 1:**
Would you try to squeeze through?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I wouldn't. 

**Speaker 1:**
What would you do then?

**Speaker 2:**
If the cars keep coming continuously, I would wait.

**Speaker 1:**
Let's assume today is a Saturday and there are fewer cars. On a regular day, there might be continuous traffic. If you were a pedestrian in such a situation, how would you cross the road?

**Speaker 2:**
I would wait for a gap in the traffic.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, thank you very much for your time today. That concludes our questions. We appreciate your participation.

**Speaker 2:**
I have filled out the compensation form, right?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, the transfer schedule is also mentioned there. If you don't receive it, just contact me. That wraps up our interview. Thank you. Do you have any questions?

**Speaker 2:**
No, thank you.
