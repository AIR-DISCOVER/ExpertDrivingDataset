**Speaker 1:**
Actually, it's really about the automation of artificial intelligence. Yes, exactly. I think it's because our previous subsidies and such weren't very substantial. It seems like you are more interested in this project. Yes, because personally, I am more focused on this than on history. So, I wanted to see how our country, especially Tsinghua University, which is a leading institution in technology, is progressing in this field.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, and our major, like International Business, not only focuses on domestic but also international markets. Sometimes we are curious about new technologies and their development both domestically and internationally. We want to see if our business studies can benefit from this. Many of our disciplines are interconnected. Autonomous driving is a relatively new field and is expected to see significant development in the next decade. Artificial intelligence is already quite mature and will play a major role in future society. Technologies like GPT are already very popular and are accelerating rapidly. Have you considered the policies and regulations? I believe Tsinghua will definitely consider these aspects and work with the government.

**Speaker 1:**
This project has already been approved, right? Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to proceed. I was wondering if, when human-driven vehicles are eventually phased out, we will have the necessary infrastructure to support the development of autonomous driving. For example, laws and ethicsâ€”what happens if an autonomous vehicle malfunctions and causes a fatal accident? Who is responsible? The legal framework isn't mature yet, right? Since it hasn't been widely implemented, many aspects are still in the initial stages. I believe these issues will be gradually addressed as the technology develops.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I think when we design these systems, we will incorporate many emergency braking systems.
**Speaker 1:**
Yes, but if he is still in the basic stage, he should definitely take a look.

**Speaker 2:**
Right, I think when we design it, we might include many emergency braking systems. In the future, passengers might even have a button for emergency braking. I believe the design will definitely lean towards caution in this regard.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, especially during the initial trial phase, it will be extremely cautious. This is because it involves road safety and personal safety. Researchers should also be aware that abroad, like Tesla, has had incidents with autonomous driving. There have been accidents both domestically and internationally. Although foreign countries might be more advanced, they still can't completely avoid these issues. We haven't yet developed to the point where we can completely avoid some inherent problems.

**Speaker 2:**
Actually, I think that even with human drivers, it's impossible to completely avoid all road situations because we can't control the external environment. So, when we design our intelligent systems, we should aim for higher safety to minimize accidents.

**Speaker 1:**
Maintaining a safe distance is very convenient. I think delivery trucks might consider autonomous driving. For example, during big shopping events like Singles' Day, we've heard about delivery trucks catching fire. If there were a human driver, they might notice the fire and take some remedial measures. Artificial intelligence could detect temperature changes and include this in the safety system. In the case of sudden incidents, the system would search through a large database of events and respond accordingly. But what do you know about the current state of autonomous trucks?

**Speaker 2:**
I feel that autonomous trucks are still relatively risky, so their development isn't as advanced.

**Speaker 2:**
However, we already have autonomous vehicles that can drive on highways.

**Speaker 1:**
But aren't those trucks owned by companies?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but trucks are larger and more valuable, carrying more resources. However, I remember that even subways have autonomous driving systems, right?
**Speaker 1:**
Since it's quite large.

**Speaker 2:**
And valuable, yes. It carries more resources, possibly. But I remember there are now driverless subways, right?

**Speaker 1:**
But subways don't have such complex pedestrian situations. Yes, I think the reason they prioritize carrying passengers is that people on board can supervise and take measures to stop and avoid some dangers. I'm recording this now, and I'll see if I can get a deeper playback from the client.

**Speaker 2:**
Are you quite familiar with this abroad? Actually, I just occasionally learn about it from the news. As an outsider, I see it from a passenger's perspective. We don't have professional researchers in this field, so we think that in the development of driverless technology, safety is still paramount. Comfort and smoothness can be secondary, but safety should be the priority, especially for passengers. For long-distance travel, it's less frequent than short-distance. For short-distance travel, the main concern is safety. Without a driver, there are inevitable worries about certain situations.

**Speaker 1:**
I'm a tech enthusiast and trust technology, but the older generation, like our parents, are more conservative and have more concerns. So, when introducing such products, it's important to consider their perspective and explain things thoroughly during product launches or press conferences.

**Speaker 2:**
Your opinion is very valuable. Our goal with this passenger and driver interview is to gather feedback. Since it's ultimately for serving people, your feelings are crucial. Today, we're focusing on artificial intelligence.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, we want to see if you feel like the experience is driven by AI.

**Speaker 2:**
It definitely doesn't feel like it yet, haha. In future experiments, we might compare two cars, one driven by a human and one by AI, to see the difference. But it's complicated and costly, requiring financial support. However, if our research reaches that point, the potential earnings could outweigh the costs. I read a news article about driverless cars being tested abroad. It seems they're progressing faster there. Have they already started carrying passengers?
**Speaker 1:** Have you already started test driving?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it seems like they start earlier abroad.

**Speaker 1:** It seems like there are fewer people on the roads there. The roads are wider, and there aren't as many cars.

**Speaker 1:** I hope our country's technology can catch up. Are you always keeping an eye on new technologies? I think most of the advancements are related to our daily lives. Whether it's international biology, electronics, cars, or pharmaceuticals, they all impact us directly. Do you have a lot of tech gadgets at home?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, like a robot vacuum. In the future, I definitely want to automate my home. Technology makes life so much easier. If a machine can replace human labor, why not use it? Especially since we often do research, human labor and brainpower are the most valuable. For me, cleaning can sometimes be a way to relax or exercise.

**Speaker 1:** That's interesting. But the only downside is that if we rely too much on technology, a power outage could cause everything to come to a standstill.

**Speaker 2:** Exactly. So, shall we wrap up our conversation for today?

**Speaker 1:** Sure, I tend to talk a lot. It's just that your insights are really interesting, and I'd love to discuss them further. My mentor and I both enjoyed today's discussion.
