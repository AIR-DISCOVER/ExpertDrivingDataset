**Speaker 1:**
We need you to clip this microphone onto your clothing. Wait a moment. Clip it onto the collar area.

**Speaker 2:**
Is this okay?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, that's fine. We will be recording this conversation, and it will be kept confidential. Can we start now?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, we can.

**Speaker 1:**
Let's start with a few simple questions. Do you often travel by car?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I do.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you usually take long trips or short trips?

**Speaker 2:**
Both long and short trips.

**Speaker 1:**
How long do you usually spend on these trips?

**Speaker 2:**
For my daily commute, it's about half an hour. For leisure trips, it can be one to three hours.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about the vehicle you traveled in today?

**Speaker 2:**
It was okay.

**Speaker 1:**
How would you rate the driver's skills?

**Speaker 2:**
The driving was quite smooth.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else? Any other impressions or comments?

**Speaker 2:**
The driver handled turns and U-turns well. The speed was cautious, probably because it was a test drive.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you felt the driving was cautious?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it wasn't as smooth as usual, felt a bit restrained.

**Speaker 1:**
If you had a choice, what type of car do you prefer for your travels? For example, an SUV, an off-road vehicle, a gasoline car, or an electric car?

**Speaker 2:**
Definitely an electric SUV.

**Speaker 1:**
Why is that?

**Speaker 2:**
Electric cars are quieter and more intelligent. SUVs or off-road vehicles offer more space and a better driving experience.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you find the space in the vehicle today?

**Speaker 2:**
It was quite compact.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it felt a bit small, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
Does the space affect your comfort during the ride?

**Speaker 2:**
If I don't compare it to other cars, it's not a big issue.

**Speaker 1:**
Would you mind the space on a long journey?

**Speaker 2:**
For long trips, it would be uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you rate your own driving skills?

**Speaker 2:**
I think I'm quite good. I pay attention to the comfort of both the passengers and pedestrians, ensuring a smooth ride.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you do any part-time driving, like for ride-sharing services?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I do, so I am more considerate of the passengers' comfort.

**Speaker 1:**
When you are a passenger, do you feel that drivers are considerate of your comfort?
**Speaker 1:** Are you doing part-time work like Didi? If so, you would be more considerate of the passenger's feelings. Do you think that when you usually take a ride, the driver takes care of your feelings as a passenger?

**Speaker 2:** They rarely do.

**Speaker 1:** Now, we will review the route you just drove. If there are any memorable points or places that made you feel something, please let me know. During this process, I will also ask you some questions. Turn right, and then turn right at the end of the road. How do you feel about this turn?

**Speaker 2:** It's okay.

**Speaker 1:** How do you feel about this road?

**Speaker 2:** There's nothing particularly noteworthy; it's quite normal.

**Speaker 1:** We are approaching a scenic spot. When you said "it's okay," what did you mean?

**Speaker 2:** I meant that it felt normal, nothing particularly bad. Just handling the new situation.

**Speaker 1:** How do you feel about this spot 150 meters ahead? When the car is in front?

**Speaker 2:** We are about to enter the main road in 400 meters. There is a car ahead, right? Yes, turn around here. We are approaching the destination, then turn around at the traffic light to enter the main road.

**Speaker 1:** Turn around near the landmark.

**Speaker 1:** Can you describe this place in detail?

**Speaker 2:** Just now, when we turned, there was a slight hesitation. The speed wasn't controlled well, and the turn wasn't very smooth.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, there was a bit of a pause.

**Speaker 1:** You mentioned there was a sudden brake, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, something like that. But on this route, it didn't seem to happen. We are approaching the landmark, then turn around at the traffic light to enter the main road.

**Speaker 1:** Turn right directly? Okay, goodbye. How do you feel when passing through the pedestrian crossing at this intersection?

**Speaker 2:** Nothing special. In 300 meters, we will reach the destination. The overall driving was quite smooth.

**Speaker 1:** Does this smooth driving make you feel anything?

**Speaker 2:** I feel quite safe.

**Speaker 1:** How do you define this sense of safety?

**Speaker 2:** It means not making you feel anxious. The speed is well controlled, and the interaction with other cars and pedestrians is handled well, making you feel comfortable and not annoyed.

**Speaker 1:** Turn right into Zhongguancun North Second Street. In 400 meters, we will reach the destination. Did the driver accelerate suddenly at any point during the trip?
**Speaker 1:** 
When you made a right turn into Zhongguancun North Second Street, did you notice any straight-line acceleration during the drive? Was it noticeable or not too heavy? Could you maintain a speed of 40 km/h? The driving speed seemed relatively slow, especially when approaching the scenic spot.

**Speaker 2:** 
Yes, when we reached the vicinity of the scenic spot, the road design had fewer main lines, and there were more turns.

**Speaker 1:** 
As we approached the scenic spot, did you feel anything when there were pedestrians or vehicles close by? How did that make you feel?

**Speaker 2:** 
It felt normal. This is typical for the road conditions I usually drive in.

**Speaker 1:** 
So, you often drive in Beijing, right?

**Speaker 2:** 
Yes, that's correct. Such situations are quite common here. In 400 meters, we will reach the scenic spot, and there is a traffic camera 100 meters ahead.

**Speaker 1:** 
We are about to reach the scenic spot, and then we will make a right turn.

**Speaker 1:** 
As we approach the scenic spot, we will turn right into Zhongguancun North Second Street. How do you feel about this section of the road?

**Speaker 2:** 
In 150 meters, we will be in the right lane, which is not the usual lane for this road.

**Speaker 1:** 
During this drive, did you feel that the driver performed any dangerous maneuvers? After the right turn, we will immediately reach the scenic spot. How do you think driving can be made safer?

**Speaker 2:** 
By following traffic rules and regulations. Sometimes, you encounter drivers who don't follow the rules, but having a plan for such situations helps. For example, if someone suddenly appears, we can control our speed to maintain safety. It's important to have a plan to avoid sudden braking.

**Speaker 1:** 
So, it's crucial to maintain a safe distance to make emergency plans, right?

**Speaker 2:** 
Yes, exactly, and to make quick judgments.

**Speaker 1:** 
How many years have you been driving? Over 15 years? That makes you an experienced driver, right?

**Speaker 2:** 
Yes, that's right. When you drive frequently, you encounter various road conditions and can make better predictions. It might also be related to one's personality.

**Speaker 1:** 
Personality?

**Speaker 2:** 
Some people drive faster and may react quickly in emergencies, while others might be more cautious and steady.

**Speaker 1:** 
But some people might feel more fatigued from constant driving.
**Speaker 1:**  
Some drivers tend to drive fast and might react impulsively in emergency situations, almost like they're in a race. I tend to accelerate quickly.

**Speaker 2:**  
But some people might be more cautious and drive more slowly. What type of driver are you?

**Speaker 1:**  
I think I fall into a more balanced category, a bit of everything, really.

**Speaker 2:**  
In your opinion, what makes a driver truly professional? What qualities or skills are essential for a driver to be considered highly professional?

**Speaker 1:**  
A professional driver should have a thorough understanding of and adherence to driving rules. Additionally, they should be able to anticipate and handle unexpected situations on the road effectively.

**Speaker 2:**  
When you're a passenger in someone else's car, what behaviors from the driver make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 1:**  
Sudden acceleration, abrupt braking, and frequent lane changes can make passengers feel uncomfortable. These actions, especially when turning onto main roads or making emergency maneuvers, can be quite unsettling.

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, frequent lane changes and sudden maneuvers can be very disconcerting.

**Speaker 1:**  
Exactly. And some drivers are always in a hurry, trying to overtake at every opportunity.

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, especially taxi drivers. They often try to squeeze into any available gap.

**Speaker 1:**  
Are there any other behaviors that make you uncomfortable when you're a passenger?

**Speaker 2:**  
No, not really. I haven't noticed anything else in this particular experiment.

**Speaker 1:**  
When you're a passenger in general, what behaviors from other drivers make you feel uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**  
We already discussed this. Sudden maneuvers and frequent lane changes are the main issues.

**Speaker 1:**  
I was asking about safety concerns earlier. Now, I'm curious about what makes you feel uncomfortable in terms of sensory, psychological, or physical aspects. This could include the driver's behavior, the passenger's behavior, or even external factors.

**Speaker 2:**  
Are you asking about driving behavior or personal habits? Both can be factors. For instance, a driver should focus on driving and not be distracted by things like talking on the phone or texting.

**Speaker 1:**  
Do these behaviors make you feel unsafe, or is it more about the noise and distraction?

**Speaker 2:**  
It's primarily about safety. Distractions can significantly increase the risk of accidents.
**Speaker 1:** Do you feel that there is a safety threat, or is it just that the noise is too loud and makes you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** There could be a safety threat. Feeling unsafe can make you distracted, and handling sudden events might not be as timely.

**Speaker 1:** If the passengers in the car are talking loudly or playing music, would you feel uncomfortable? Not just in terms of space, but in general.

**Speaker 2:** If it's music I like, then it's probably fine. But if it's not, for example, if there are many passengers and multiple sources of noise, it can be distracting.

**Speaker 1:** How would you define comfort while driving?

**Speaker 2:** For driving, comfort means maintaining a moderate speed, not accelerating or decelerating suddenly. The transition in speed should be smooth. Also, I prefer a quieter environment. If there is sound, it should be pleasant music or soothing sounds.

**Speaker 1:** In what aspects do you think autonomous driving can never match human driving?

**Speaker 2:** Actually, as long as everyone follows the rules, I think autonomous driving can be safer than human driving. Except in cases of system failure, of course, there might be some loss of control.

**Speaker 1:** By loss of control, do you mean machine malfunction?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. 

**Speaker 1:** Do you think today's driving experience was autonomous or human-driven?

**Speaker 2:** I think it was probably autonomous driving.

**Speaker 1:** Why do you think so?

**Speaker 2:** Just to experience it, I guess.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think it was autonomous driving because of the experiment we're doing today, or did you feel it was autonomous throughout the experience?

**Speaker 2:** I felt it was very cautious. If it were human-operated, it would have been smoother. It felt very careful, not as fluid.

**Speaker 1:** So you think it maintained a very safe distance and a stable speed, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:** Were there any moments that made you feel it was human-driven?

**Speaker 2:** No, I didn't feel any moments that seemed human-controlled.

**Speaker 1:** Let me ask you a question about crossing the street as a pedestrian. If you are at an intersection without traffic lights, how do you judge the intentions of the vehicles around you? For example, whether they are going to turn, go straight, or stop to let you pass?

**Speaker 2:** You can only...
**Speaker 1:** How do you interpret the intentions of non-motorized vehicles? For example, whether they want to turn, pass through, or stop and wait for you to pass?

**Speaker 2:** You can only gauge their intentions by driving slowly and cautiously, probing their actions by reducing your speed.

**Speaker 1:** Are you referring to yourself as the driver? How do you, as a pedestrian, judge the driver's intentions or the intentions of non-motorized vehicles?

**Speaker 2:** If a vehicle approaches an intersection without traffic signals and doesn't slow down, it likely intends to pass through. If it slows down, the driver might be observing pedestrians or other vehicles to decide whether to stop or continue.

**Speaker 1:** How do you determine if the driver intends to stop?

**Speaker 2:** By observing the distance between the vehicle and surrounding objects or people.

**Speaker 1:** Can you elaborate on what you mean by observing the distance?

**Speaker 2:** In situations without traffic signals, which usually occur when there are fewer vehicles or pedestrians, you need to be cautious. For instance, if I am moving east-west and there are vehicles or people moving north-south, no one knows who will yield. Both parties might cautiously move forward until one decides it's unsafe and stops, allowing the other to pass. If everyone moves forward simultaneously, it could lead to problems.

**Speaker 1:** Do you also observe the behavior of surrounding pedestrians? If it were you, would you choose to move slowly, wait for the vehicle to pass completely, or just go through directly?

**Speaker 2:** The safest option is to stop and let others pass first. This is the absolutely safe choice.

**Speaker 1:** What would you do?

**Speaker 2:** I might cautiously move forward.

**Speaker 1:** Move forward cautiously to save time, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because it's unclear what the other party intends to do.

**Speaker 1:** Exactly, it's mutual probing. What is your definition of intelligent driving?

**Speaker 2:** It means completely relying on machine data collection without human intervention, using the collected data to follow traffic rules and make decisions.

**Speaker 1:** That concludes our interview for today. Do you have any questions?

**Speaker 2:** No, I don't have any questions.

**Speaker 1:** Okay, then we'll end the recording.

**Speaker 2:** Alright.
