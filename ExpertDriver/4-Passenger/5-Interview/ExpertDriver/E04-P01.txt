**Speaker 1:**
Before we play the video, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your usual travel habits. Do you often travel by car?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I do.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you usually take long trips or short trips? How long are your short trips typically?

**Speaker 2:**
Usually within half an hour.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about the ride in our vehicle during this experiment?

**Speaker 2:**
It was okay.

**Speaker 1:**
How would you rate the driver's skills?

**Speaker 2:**
The driving was smooth, but the speed was a bit slow. It felt like a beginner's speed, especially when turning, as other cars would overtake us.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel anxious at any point?

**Speaker 2:**
No, not really.

**Speaker 1:**
If you had to choose, what type of car do you prefer for travel?

**Speaker 2:**
A regular family sedan would be fine.

**Speaker 1:**
Why do you prefer that type of car? Do you have a particular preference for that model?

**Speaker 2:**
No, not really. I just don't have any special requirements.

**Speaker 1:**
Are you more inclined towards gasoline cars or electric cars?

**Speaker 2:**
Currently, I lean more towards gasoline cars.

**Speaker 1:**
Why is that?

**Speaker 2:**
I'm concerned about finding charging stations for electric cars.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you have a gasoline car at home?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, we use a gasoline car for family use.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you drive?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but I'm not very good at it. I'm a beginner, so I don't drive often.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you consider yourself a beginner driver?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes.

**Speaker 1:**
Now, let's watch the video of our recent drive. If you notice any moments that change your experience, feel free to point them out. I might pause at certain points to ask about your feelings during those segments. How did you feel about the driver's start?

**Speaker 2:**
It was fine, quite smooth.

**Speaker 1:**
How about the driver's handling of multiple turns?

**Speaker 2:**
No issues there.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you notice the vehicles behind us while turning?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I did. I would turn my head to check.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think the driver was also paying attention?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I believe so.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel while passing through that particular section of the road?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't feel much, just normal.
**Speaker 1:**
When you were driving through that section of the road, how did you feel?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't feel much. I just wondered if the distance was enough to get through. I wasn't worried about it.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel when that electric scooter suddenly appeared?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't feel anything special.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you rate the driving skills on this section of the road?

**Speaker 2:**
It's okay. All four vehicles, including the electric scooter, were overtaken. Overall, I think it wasn't too bad.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you wish the driver could drive a bit faster?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I think he was a bit too cautious, like he was strictly following the test rules.

**Speaker 1:**
You think he could drive more naturally?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. For instance, when he changed lanes, he did it directly. Did you worry about cars coming from behind?

**Speaker 1:**
No, I wasn't worried because the road was quite empty.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it felt quite empty.

**Speaker 1:**
If there were more cars, would you feel more nervous?

**Speaker 2:**
No.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you trust this driver?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, even if there was a collision, it would hit the back first, not the front where I am. I didn't think about it too much.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you think he handled the U-turn?

**Speaker 2:**
It was okay. There was a car in front of us that also had to back up a bit before turning. I thought he might have to do the same because the entrance was a bit narrow.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel unsafe or anxious at any point?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I checked the left side where the U-turn was, and there was a signal from the car. It was fine.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel the driver accelerate at any point?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I did. It was smooth.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel the braking was smooth?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the whole ride felt very smooth.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel when passing through that intersection?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't feel anything special.

**Speaker 1:**
Did the driver accelerate there?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, he did. I think it would be better if he drove a bit faster.

**Speaker 1:**
Why didn't you use the handle?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't feel the need to. It was safe enough.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about the driver's actions when pedestrians were crossing the road?

**Speaker 2:**
It was fine. He was very courteous and followed the rules.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you also follow the rules strictly when you drive?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, although sometimes I forget to use the turn signal.

**Speaker 1:**
When you're a passenger, do you pay more attention to whether the driver is following the rules?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I do.
**Speaker 1:**
Do you follow the rules?

**Speaker 2:**
Well, sometimes I might forget to signal.

**Speaker 1:**
When you're a passenger in someone else's car, do you pay attention to whether they follow traffic rules?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I do.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you feel about the distance they keep from pedestrians?

**Speaker 2:**
It's quite safe.

**Speaker 1:**
Quite safe. How do you feel when going over speed bumps? This area is tricky to adjust to, especially when turning.

**Speaker 2:**
I noticed that during the first test, this spot felt bumpier compared to other places.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you press the handle the first time?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't. But the second time, I felt a bit unsure whether to press it or not because it felt bumpier here than elsewhere.

**Speaker 1:**
So you felt uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it felt bumpier than other intersections.

**Speaker 1:**
But you didn't press it the second time either, right?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't. It wasn't uncomfortable enough to press it, but it was noticeably bumpier.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you think the driver handled this section?

**Speaker 2:**
It was fine, quite fast compared to before.

**Speaker 1:**
But it slows down near the Fourth Ring Road, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, you can see that on the Fourth Ring Road, all cars slow down. It feels like the driver becomes more alert on the main road.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you notice if the driver paid attention to the passengers' comfort?

**Speaker 2:**
I'm not sure.

**Speaker 1:**
You didn't notice? Did you pay attention to the road conditions?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, this area has a lot of traffic, including electric bikes, so the driver is very cautious here.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you feel about this approach?

**Speaker 2:**
I think it would be better if the test route on the main road was longer. The driver tends to stay on the right side, which affects the speed because of the traffic. If the test route was longer, it might be more effective.

**Speaker 1:**
So you think the driver is cautious?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, especially in this section. If the test route was longer, it might give a better assessment.
**Speaker 1:**
He would noticeably feel this part. Hmm, I think if it's a test, shouldn't the main focus be on other areas?

**Speaker 2:**
This route should be. Yes, it seems like the driver was a bit cautious.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, it felt like he was more alert than us.

**Speaker 2:**
Right, it felt like, haha, he was more vigilant than us.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you find any of the maneuvers particularly dangerous?

**Speaker 2:**
When he parked at the end.

**Speaker 1:**
When he parked at the end. Hmm, okay, we'll check that out later. Why didn't you use the handle at that time?

**Speaker 2:**
Not sure, maybe it was part of the experiment requirements? Because he hit the parking pole twice.

**Speaker 1:**
So, if we set aside the experiment requirements, what would you suggest?

**Speaker 2:**
Maybe a warning, hmm.

**Speaker 1:**
When you usually ride in someone else's car, what behaviors from the driver make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**
Sudden lane changes. Hmm? Anything else? Hard braking. Anything else? Not really. Speeding. This driver didn't seem to have any speeding alerts, but usually, navigation systems would warn about that, right?

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think makes driving safer?

**Speaker 2:**
Following the rules.

**Speaker 1:**
Just following the rules. Hmm, anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really, following the rules should be enough.

**Speaker 1:**
When you usually ride in someone else's car, what behaviors from the driver make you feel uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
The driver, hmm, talking on the phone, smoking, or doing other things.

**Speaker 1:**
Hmm, are there any driving maneuvers that make you feel uncomfortable physically or subjectively?

**Speaker 2:**
No, no.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think makes driving more comfortable for you as a passenger?

**Speaker 2:**
How so?

**Speaker 1:**
The simpler the operation, the better.

**Speaker 2:**
Just don't have too many complicated buttons or actions.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think having too many buttons and actions affects the car's stability?

**Speaker 2:**
Hmm, not really the stability, but it can be hard to react quickly, especially for female drivers. If there are too many buttons, it might be hard to find the right one in a moment. So, I think the simpler the operation, the more I would like the car.

**Speaker 1:**
As a passenger, what do you think?

**Speaker 2:**
As a passenger, comfort is important.

**Speaker 1:**
What aspects contribute to this comfort?

**Speaker 2:**
For example, if the seat is uncomfortable, like causing back pain, even if I haven't been sitting for long. Hmm, less than half an hour, but I felt the seatback was very hard.

**Speaker 1:**
Hmm, that feeling.

**Speaker 2:**
The comfort level was low. Also, the air conditioning seemed to be set low.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, because we need to maintain the temperature.

**Speaker 2:**
Hmm, but I felt the noise...
**Speaker 1:**
I adjusted the air conditioning a bit by hand. It was set to a relatively low level.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because we need to maintain the temperature.

**Speaker 1:**
Right, but I felt the noise was quite loud. I couldn't tell if it was the air conditioning or the car itself, maybe both. The noise was quite noticeable.

**Speaker 2:**
How do you think the driver could make the ride more comfortable for you? What kind of driving would make you feel better?

**Speaker 1:**
Smooth driving, perhaps?

**Speaker 2:**
It felt okay. How did today's driver do?

**Speaker 1:**
The ride was very smooth. You wouldn't think the driver lacked skill because there were no sudden brakes, and it felt consistently stable. There was nothing that made me feel unsafe. However, the speed felt a bit slow.

**Speaker 2:**
When you ride in other people's cars, what driving behaviors make you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 1:**
Sudden braking, for example.

**Speaker 2:**
Those are similar to the actions that make you feel unsafe.

**Speaker 1:**
When the driver maintains a steady speed on the main road, how do you feel, aside from the speed being slow?

**Speaker 2:**
It's good, definitely very safe.

**Speaker 1:**
So, in terms of safety, the driver did a good job. Did you check the traffic behind you when the driver merged onto the main road?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I did.

**Speaker 1:**
When you're sitting in the front passenger seat, what do you mainly focus on? What do you observe?

**Speaker 2:**
I look at the angle of the view. Maybe because I'm a bit shorter, I feel like the view of the car in front is somewhat obstructed. I wonder if it's because the seat is positioned lower.

**Speaker 1:**
It could be a seat adjustment issue. So, you mainly focus on the front and the right side?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the front and the right side.

**Speaker 1:**
And you only look to the left when turning?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I don't usually observe the driver. When I ride in other people's cars, I might glance at the driver, but not always.

**Speaker 1:**
You might be more focused on your own activities. For example, from this angle, I can't see the outside through the corresponding window, so I wonder if it's because I'm a bit shorter or if the car's design has a lower seat.

**Speaker 2:**
It might be because the seat wasn't adjusted after the previous passenger. I'll mention this to our team. Did you notice the taxi that was close to our car?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, I saw it and heard the honking.

**Speaker 2:**
Right, it was right there, wasn't it?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes.
**Speaker 1:** So, you didn't see it?

**Speaker 2:** I saw it and also heard the car honking.

**Speaker 1:** Right, it was right there, immediately. Is that correct?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, yes, there was a warning.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think the two cars were too close to each other? Did you turn your head to check?

**Speaker 2:** I did look, but I thought it should be able to pass.

**Speaker 1:** When you heard the radar alert, how did you feel? Did you think a collision was imminent?

**Speaker 2:** No, I didn't.

**Speaker 1:** Hold on, let me check something. 

**Speaker 1:** There might be some parts missing from the recording. Can you recall if there was anything particularly noteworthy about the last part of the drive?

**Speaker 2:** The last part? Everything was fine except for the parking at the end. I remember it clearly. There were yellow and red lines. When the red line appeared, the alarm went off, but the driver still backed up a bit more.

**Speaker 1:** You felt he shouldn't have backed up further?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, if it were me, I would have stopped when the red line alarm went off. But he did back up and hit the parking barrier.

**Speaker 1:** The car jolted a bit, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it did.

**Speaker 1:** So, that made you feel unsafe and uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, if there was any issue during the whole trip, it was during the final parking.

**Speaker 1:** Alright, what do you think makes a good or professional driver? Quick reactions?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, quick reactions. 

**Speaker 1:** Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** Familiarity with the roads.

**Speaker 1:** Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** That's about it.

**Speaker 1:** Since you mentioned you're a new driver, what do you think is the biggest difference between you and an experienced driver?

**Speaker 2:** The biggest difference? My reactions are noticeably slower, and I tend to be more nervous throughout the drive. My handling isn't as smooth either.

**Speaker 1:** Have you learned about autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:** Not much, but I'm interested, which is why I joined the experiment.

**Speaker 1:** Based on your understanding of autonomous driving, what do you think it can never do as well as a human?

**Speaker 2:** Never as well as a human? I'm worried it might suddenly lose control.

**Speaker 1:** Sudden loss of control? Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** In extreme weather conditions, I worry it won't be able to adapt and judge the situation as well as a human.

**Speaker 1:** Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** No, that's about it.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think the recent trip was driven by a human or by autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't notice, actually.
**Speaker 1:**
Are there any other points? Do you think the recent trip was driven by a human or by an autonomous system?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't write it down. Yes, I think it felt like a human was driving. Why? Because if it was autonomous driving at that speed, it would be too slow. I believe the driver might have been a bit cautious, which caused the situation.

**Speaker 1:**
So, because it was driving slowly, you think it wasn't autonomous driving. What do you think autonomous driving should be like?

**Speaker 2:**
It would adjust its speed according to the road conditions. For example, it would slow down in traffic and speed up when the road is clear.

**Speaker 1:**
Okay, so if the vehicle was indeed autonomous and the driver was just a safety operator pretending to drive, how would that differ from your usual experience?

**Speaker 2:**
Isn't that the speed I usually ride at?

**Speaker 1:**
Haha, let's set aside the fact that it was driving slowly. What other details would make you think it wasn't a human driving?

**Speaker 2:**
If it was autonomous, it might still be in the testing phase, and the speed wasn't optimized yet.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else? No, that's it. So, as a pedestrian, if you were to cross an intersection without traffic lights, how would you judge the intentions of the oncoming drivers?

**Speaker 2:**
I follow the rules strictly, so I usually wait for the green light. If there are no lights, I let the cars go first. If I can't tell if the driver intends to let me pass, I always let the car go first because I'm cautious. I don't rush because of my own urgency; it's a psychological thing.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you wait until there are no cars before crossing.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, that's all the questions for today's interview. Thank you very much for participating in our experiment.

**Speaker 2:**
Was it really a human?

**Speaker 1:**
Wait a moment, let me check.
