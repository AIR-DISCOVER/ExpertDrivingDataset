**Speaker 1:**
First, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your daily travel habits. Do you often travel by car? Is it usually for long or short distances?

**Speaker 2:**
It depends. If I'm traveling for leisure, it might be long distances, like taking a taxi or going on vacation. For daily activities like work or study, I usually just take the bus. I rarely take a taxi.

**Speaker 1:**
How long do you usually travel?

**Speaker 2:**
Not very long, unless it's for research purposes, which might be once or twice a month. In those cases, the distance could be around 20 to 30 kilometers.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it can be quite a long trip.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, especially for research purposes.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you find the experience of riding in our vehicle for this experiment?

**Speaker 2:**
It was quite good. The driver's skills were impressive, but I wasn't very fond of the car model. I prefer electric vehicles.

**Speaker 1:**
If you could choose, what type of car would you prefer for travel?

**Speaker 2:**
Electric vehicles, mainly because they have a better smell and overall comfort.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you have any specific preferences for car models?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really, but I think more expensive cars might offer better comfort.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you drive yourself?

**Speaker 2:**
Not yet, but I plan to.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, now I'm going to play a video of our recent drive. If you notice any moments that change your experience, please let me know. I'll also pause at certain points to ask about your feelings. How did you feel when we started driving at 70 km/h and then slowed down to 2 meters per second?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't feel much difference.

**Speaker 1:**
Even in restricted areas, please plan your travel reasonably. How did you feel about the driver's handling of the multiple turns?

**Speaker 2:**
It made me a bit anxious.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think the unpleasant smell in the car comes from the fuel?

**Speaker 2:**
I'm not sure if it's from the fuel.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think it has to do with the car's interior design and seating?

**Speaker 2:**
I don't know. I usually refer to this smell as "car smell." Sometimes, I even ask others if they notice it after a long ride.
**Speaker 1:** How did you find the seat?

**Speaker 2:** I'm not sure. I usually refer to this smell as "car smell." Sometimes, I even ask others if they can smell it after sitting for a long time. Generally, I tell them it's the first whiff you get. At that moment, I suddenly felt like washing my clothes.

**Speaker 1:** Was it a bad smell? So, you pressed the button here. How did you feel when the driver entered the side road? It seemed a bit chaotic ahead.

**Speaker 2:** Around that time, I could strongly sense that the driver was not very experienced.

**Speaker 1:** How do you think the driver handled the car?

**Speaker 2:** It felt like there was no driver. Yes, he entered the left front.

**Speaker 1:** Onto the main road. Did he press the button ahead as well?

**Speaker 2:** Somewhere around that area, he suddenly pressed it. Now, he pressed it here.

**Speaker 1:** Was it here? It should be here.

**Speaker 2:** Oh, after getting onto the main road, he took a deep breath. We didn't feel much on the dead-end road.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel anxious? After inhaling that smell, did you just feel uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't like that smell.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel the driver accelerated on this stretch?

**Speaker 2:** I couldn't really tell. Maybe a little.

**Speaker 1:** But overall, the ride was quite smooth.

**Speaker 1:** When you usually take other cars, do you often experience unsteady driving?

**Speaker 2:** I think it also depends on the region.

**Speaker 1:** Does it make you car sick?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it does.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think it has to do with the price? Experienced drivers usually don't want to.

**Speaker 1:** When you encounter situations where the gas and brake pedals are not used smoothly, does it make you worry about driving safety?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it does.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think they drive too recklessly?

**Speaker 2:** Once in Zhengzhou, I took a taxi, and the driver ran a red light. He blatantly ran it, even changing lanes to do so. It was a wrong-way red light run.

**Speaker 1:** So, you felt particularly unsafe at that time. How do you think driving can be safer?

**Speaker 2:** How to drive more safely? By following traffic rules.

**Speaker 1:** Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** Also, paying more attention to the entrances.

**Speaker 1:** How do you think he handled the U-turn?

**Speaker 2:** It might be a road issue. It felt a bit too close.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel nervous? Did you check if there were any cars coming from behind?

**Speaker 2:** No, I didn't.

**Speaker 1:** As a passenger, don't you worry about safety?

**Speaker 2:** Worrying doesn't help. If something happens, it's not in my control.

**Speaker 1:** Very laid-back. What do you observe when you're in the car?

**Speaker 2:** It might be related to my field of study. I observe the numbers and such.

**Speaker 1:** So, you don't really observe safety?
**Speaker 1:** When you're in the car, what do you observe?

**Speaker 2:** Actually, it might be related to my field of study. I observe the numbers and such.

**Speaker 1:** So, you don't really observe the safety conditions?

**Speaker 2:** I turn right, and then there's no traffic coming. I don't have a driver's license, so I turn right.

**Speaker 1:** Hmm, how do you usually evaluate a driver? What dimensions do you use for evaluation?

**Speaker 2:** Braking, acceleration, and parking.

**Speaker 1:** Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** That seems to be about it.

**Speaker 2:** We're about to reach the destination. Turn right at the traffic light.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think the driver is driving fast overall?

**Speaker 2:** Not fast, not fast.

**Speaker 1:** Do you feel that it looks faster on camera compared to when you're actually in the car?

**Speaker 2:** Not really.

**Speaker 1:** Do you observe the driver? Like, do you look at the dashboard or their expressions?

**Speaker 2:** This is an experiment, so I usually don't. But in normal situations, I might.

**Speaker 1:** Why don't you observe these things during our experiment?

**Speaker 2:** I wouldn't dare! I don't want to interfere with your experiment. I'm just a participant.

**Speaker 1:** But it's actually quite free. Except for the restrictions we mentioned.

**Speaker 2:** Maybe because it's an experiment, I tend to be more restrained.

**Speaker 1:** Were you a bit nervous throughout the process?

**Speaker 2:** Not really nervous, just felt like I should be a proper participant.

**Speaker 1:** How do you think the driver maintained distance from other vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists? Did you observe that?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't specifically observe that, but I noticed it.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel when the car went over speed bumps?

**Speaker 2:** It jolted a bit.

**Speaker 1:** Did it feel uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** It was just a normal jolt, nothing too uncomfortable. We're about to reach the next point.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think the driver performed any dangerous maneuvers during the trip? Did anything make you feel uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** No dangerous maneuvers, and nothing made me feel uncomfortable. I didn't worry about pedestrians suddenly appearing either.

**Speaker 1:** How do you think the road design could be improved?

**Speaker 2:** The road design is quite good. Especially the sections we just passed. The road width is suitable for a two-lane road. If it were a four-lane or six-lane road, it would feel completely different. I remember there was a section with a canal in the middle.

**Speaker 1:** Was that in the earlier part of the route?
**Speaker 1:** How does the number of lanes, like 4 or 6 lanes, affect your driving experience? I remember there was a section with a canal in the middle.

**Speaker 2:** Are you referring to the earlier part of the drive?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, was it in the earlier part?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, there was a small black box in the front. It should be further back, right?

**Speaker 1:** Can we rewind and check? Is it in the back? Okay, got it.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it should be further back.

**Speaker 1:** Alright, let's move forward. It was around here, right?

**Speaker 2:** This part is actually okay, within acceptable limits. We're about to reach our destination.

**Speaker 1:** How do you feel about the overall road conditions today?

**Speaker 2:** It's alright, the traffic in Beijing is manageable.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think our driver today has room for improvement? What could he do to make you feel safer?

**Speaker 2:** He could be as good as the best drivers I've encountered.

**Speaker 1:** How do you feel about the distance he kept from pedestrians? Did you feel it was dangerous?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't notice any videos or pay attention to that.

**Speaker 1:** What were you paying attention to at that moment?

**Speaker 2:** The trees, the low branches, and the surroundings.

**Speaker 1:** So you were looking at the overall environment. We're about to reach the 5 o'clock mark.

**Speaker 2:** Sometimes, on the road, you need to request a left turn, especially when facing oncoming traffic.

**Speaker 1:** Do you ever consider safety issues? When do you think about safety?

**Speaker 2:** Worrying about safety all the time is excessive. If I were constantly anxious, I'd be stressed out every day.

**Speaker 1:** So you only think about safety when it's really close and dangerous?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, if the driver is a friend, I might consider these issues more.

**Speaker 1:** So your definition of a safe range is quite broad. We're about to turn left in 100 meters. Did you feel any bumps?

**Speaker 2:** No, I didn't feel any bumps.

**Speaker 1:** On empty roads, what do you pay attention to? When there are no people or cars, do you still look around?

**Speaker 2:** On empty roads, with no people or cars, I just relax.

**Speaker 1:** Aren't you worried about a car suddenly appearing?

**Speaker 2:** That's too much worrying, it's unnecessary.

**Speaker 1:** So you don't worry at all?

**Speaker 2:** You're not the driver, so worrying won't help.

**Speaker 1:** But you trust the driver a lot, right?

**Speaker 2:** Unless the driver asks me to keep an eye out, I don't worry. If we're planning a trip next week, maybe then.

**Speaker 1:** Does the driver's speed affect you?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, please stay in the right lane. In 50 meters, turn left at the traffic light. Do you feel the driver's speed is too fast?
**Speaker 1:**
So, how did the actual driving experience affect you? Please stay in the right lane for the next 50 meters. At the traffic light, turn left or right. Did you feel the driver was going too fast or too slow? Here, you pressed your arm and mentioned something about the canal and the curve.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it reminded me of that advertisement. This road actually feels quite nice, much better than the city roads. Even though the lanes here are wider, the canal acts as a barrier, making the overall driving experience smoother. The tall buildings here don't feel as oppressive either. It feels more comfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you feel more relaxed here, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the previous section was also quite relaxing. When we suddenly turned here, I realized this area is also quite relaxing compared to the city roads.

**Speaker 1:**
What behaviors from other drivers make you uncomfortable when you're a passenger? What specific actions make you uneasy?

**Speaker 2:**
Sudden braking, sharp turns, and any abrupt movements. Sudden acceleration and hard braking are particularly unsettling.

**Speaker 1:**
We are approaching the destination. Please turn right soon. Do you remember where you pressed the second handle? It was when we parked.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, we arrived and turned right. The surrounding buildings looked quite different.

**Speaker 1:**
We are about to arrive. Please turn right. Did you notice any cyclists?

**Speaker 2:**
I was probably looking to the right.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you were mainly focused on the right side?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really, I just suddenly noticed the unique buildings and started observing them.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you also look to the left?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, sometimes, depending on the situation.

**Speaker 1:**
When turning, do you check both sides?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I do, depending on the situation.

**Speaker 1:**
Please turn right and stay close to the curb. In 100 meters, we will reach the subway station.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you observe the driver's speed? Did you notice if they were speeding?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't consider that at all.

**Speaker 2:**
If they were speeding, it would be obvious.

**Speaker 2:**
We are approaching the destination. Please turn left at the next intersection.

**Speaker 1:**
We are about to arrive. Please turn left here. Did you notice the road conditions? It seems a bit complicated here.

**Speaker 2:**
No, it seemed normal to me. Maybe the video made it look more stressful.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think the driver should overtake the car in front?

**Speaker 2:**
No, it's not possible to overtake here.

**Speaker 2:**
In 250 meters, we will reach the destination. Please turn right at the end of the road to reach the main area.
**Speaker 1:** We're 250 meters away from King County. We're about to reach the destination. After that, turn right at the end of the road to reach the scenic spot nearby. Then, turn right at the end of the road to enter the main road.

**Speaker 2:** Alright, you see, now you just keep going. Good, now you have both mirrors adjusted. Generally, for soft turns, the mirrors are fine.

**Speaker 1:** So, you pressed the handle here?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, turn.

**Speaker 1:** When turning, is it when we're almost back? Is it a left turn ahead? Are we done yet? No, it seems like it just got stuck for a moment.

**Speaker 2:** The phone call interrupted, and the two lines appeared. Generally, it’s like running a ball. Hmm, in...

**Speaker 1:** The leftmost lane, 250 meters ahead, at the traffic light in this video.

**Speaker 2:** The back part wasn't recorded.

**Speaker 1:** Hold on a second, senior, the video didn't capture it. Can you recall it?

**Speaker 2:** It's just the turn ahead. You see the traffic light at the turn.

**Speaker 1:** And how did you feel at that moment?

**Speaker 2:** At that moment, it was purely about disliking this street.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think the city's landscape design made you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, you could say that. Actually, this is related to environmental behavior psychology, right? The environment didn't give you a good feeling.

**Speaker 1:** So, it was just the oppressive feeling of the environment. Right. I have a few more questions. Have you heard about autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I've heard about it but haven't looked into it deeply.

**Speaker 1:** What do you think it is like?

**Speaker 2:** Autonomous driving is just a car without a driver taking you to your destination.

**Speaker 1:** Considering its speed and distance, how do you think it performs?

**Speaker 2:** Its speed and distance should be similar to a regular car, but it might be more consistent and perhaps more serious.

**Speaker 1:** What aspects do you think it can't perform like a human?

**Speaker 2:** This involves the trolley problem, right? If there's a person in front and three people on the side, which one should it hit if it has to?

**Speaker 1:** You mean, but if it's on the road, what would it do? It would stop, right? Are you talking about a situation where the brakes fail?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, if the braking speed isn't precise enough. I remember this is a bottleneck in intelligent driving technology. I've heard about this.

**Speaker 1:** Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, and there's also the liability issue. If an autonomous vehicle gets into an accident...
**Speaker 1:**
Is there anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, and there's also the issue of liability. If an autonomous vehicle gets into an accident, who is responsible?

**Speaker 1:**
Actually, there are different levels of autonomy. Yes, and once it reaches a certain level, the responsibility falls on the vehicle itself. So, do you think the recent trip was driven by a human or by the car? Was it manual driving or autonomous?

**Speaker 2:**
That's a philosophical question.

**Speaker 1:**
Based on your experience during the ride, what do you think?

**Speaker 2:**
From my experience, could it have been the car driving?

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think?

**Speaker 2:**
I saw someone sitting next to me, so I assumed it was a human driving.

**Speaker 1:**
Right. Now, let's assume the car was actually driving autonomously, and the person next to you was just a safety officer pretending to drive. If you think about it that way, how does it compare to your usual riding experience?

**Speaker 2:**
The technology was very stable.

**Speaker 1:**
What details made you think it might have been autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:**
The braking felt different. Normally, a human driver can't achieve that kind of braking precision.

**Speaker 1:**
You felt the braking was consistently smooth?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes. Normally, when a human brakes, there's a slight jolt at the end. But this braking was so precise that it smoothly brought the car to a stop without any sudden jolt. This level of precision is very hard to achieve unless the system is highly advanced. I noticed that when the car was approaching a red light, it started braking from a distance, gradually slowing down, unlike a human driver who might brake closer to the light. It felt very smooth and calculated.

**Speaker 1:**
As a pedestrian crossing an intersection without traffic lights, how do you judge the intentions of oncoming drivers?

**Speaker 2:**
Could you repeat the question?

**Speaker 1:**
As a pedestrian crossing an intersection without traffic lights, how do you judge the intentions of oncoming drivers?

**Speaker 2:**
By their speed.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else? Like their direction?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, direction is important too. It's a comprehensive analysis. If a car is moving fast and doesn't seem to be slowing down, it means the driver has seen you and is aware of your presence.

**Speaker 1:**
In such a situation, how would you cross?

**Speaker 2:**
If the driver shows signs of stopping, I would go ahead and cross.

**Speaker 1:**
Exactly.
**Speaker 1:**
When you see that he has noticed you, how would you proceed in this situation?

**Speaker 2:**
If he has acknowledged me, I would go ahead.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it's not about him slowing down. How would you handle passing through an intersection without traffic lights?

**Speaker 2:**
I would assess the distance between my car and the other vehicles. I would look for a relatively open space to proceed. If I can't find a gap, and if a vehicle stops to let me pass, I would go through after they stop. If no one stops, I would wait for the next opportunity.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, those are all our questions. Thank you very much for participating in our experiment today.

**Speaker 2:**
You're welcome.
