**Speaker 1:**
Alright, let me start by asking you a few questions. Do you often travel by car?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, frequently.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you usually take long or short trips? How long do they typically last?

**Speaker 2:**
About half an hour or so.

**Speaker 1:**
And how did you find the experience of riding in our vehicle this time?

**Speaker 2:**
It was quite stable.

**Speaker 1:**
How would you rate the driver's skills?

**Speaker 2:**
Pretty good.

**Speaker 1:**
When you say "stable," what exactly do you mean?

**Speaker 2:**
I mean the control over speed and braking.

**Speaker 1:**
If you had to choose, what type of car would you prefer for your trips?

**Speaker 2:**
A spacious one, like an SUV.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you have a preference between gasoline and electric cars?

**Speaker 2:**
From a passenger's perspective, I prefer electric cars.

**Speaker 1:**
Why is that?

**Speaker 2:**
Because they start more smoothly, accelerate faster, and are quieter.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you drive yourself?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I do.

**Speaker 1:**
How would you rate your own driving skills?

**Speaker 2:**
Not bad, not bad.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, I'll now play a video of our recent drive. If you notice any moments that affect your experience, please let me know. I'll pause at specific points to ask for your feedback. How did you feel when the car started?

**Speaker 2:**
Very stable. The start was slow because there was a motorcycle ahead, but it was indeed smooth.

**Speaker 1:**
How about when the car was turning out of the parking lot?

**Speaker 2:**
No noticeable centrifugal force.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it didn't feel like you were being thrown around?

**Speaker 2:**
No, it was very smooth.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you notice any oncoming traffic?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I did. Since I drive myself, I habitually pay attention to that.

**Speaker 1:**
Did the driver slow down?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, he did. He anticipated the situation well.

**Speaker 1:**
How did the driver handle the right turn?

**Speaker 2:**
It was fine, but a bit slow compared to how I would usually drive.
**Speaker 1:** So, how did you feel about the driver's handling of the right turn?

**Speaker 2:** On this road, it was fine. Yes, it was quite steady. If it were a normal driving situation, it might have felt a bit slow.

**Speaker 1:** A bit slow, huh?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, but for the passengers, this reduces discomfort significantly.

**Speaker 1:** So, it felt safer because the driver was going slower?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, going slower can make it feel safer.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about the driver's performance on the side road?

**Speaker 2:** On the side road, there was an instance where he encountered a pedestrian. He slowed down in advance, which was good.

**Speaker 1:** Do you need me to rewind the video?

**Speaker 2:** No, that's not necessary.

**Speaker 1:** Okay, so what happened next?

**Speaker 2:** There was an elderly lady crossing the road.

**Speaker 1:** Oh, I see.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, so he had to make a sudden stop.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel that?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it was the only sudden stop during the entire trip.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel unsafe or uncomfortable at that moment?

**Speaker 2:** No, the driver handled it well by maintaining a good safety distance. I appreciated that.

**Speaker 1:** But there was some discomfort because of the sudden stop, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, there was a bit of discomfort.

**Speaker 1:** Were you worried about hitting the elderly lady?

**Speaker 2:** No, I wasn't worried about hitting her, just felt a bit uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:** Overall, how did you feel about the driver's performance on the side road?

**Speaker 2:** Overall, he drove quite well.

**Speaker 1:** And on the main road?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't see much of the main road, but he should have checked the left side.

**Speaker 1:** Were you worried about cars coming from behind?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I was worried, but I couldn't see.

**Speaker 1:** Why didn't you press the handle then?

**Speaker 2:** I trusted the driver because he was driving slowly, so we felt relatively safe.

**Speaker 1:** So, the worry was more of a habitual concern rather than a reflection of the driver's skills?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it was a habitual concern, not because of the driver's skills.

**Speaker 1:** There was a warning here, but you didn't press anything. Why?

**Speaker 2:** It felt normal at the time.

**Speaker 1:** There were 3 to 4 bumps on this route. Did you feel they were normal?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, they felt like normal bumps.

**Speaker 1:** Did you think the driver could have avoided the bumps?

**Speaker 2:** He could have slowed down or maneuvered around them. As a front-seat passenger, I think the driver should try to avoid them, but in reality, it's not always possible to avoid every bump.
**Speaker 1:**  
So, you mentioned that you could maneuver around the manhole cover or slow down a bit, but in actual driving, the manhole cover is unlikely to be avoided. Otherwise, you would have to stop because there are no cars in front of the car ahead.

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, that's right. And if there are bumps, it also depends on the nature of the car, like its suspension and shock absorbers.

**Speaker 1:**  
How do you think the car performed on this stretch of road, especially on the main road?

**Speaker 2:**  
Considering the road conditions, it performed quite well. Especially as you continue driving forward, you can feel the braking is well-timed.

**Speaker 1:**  
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "performed well"?

**Speaker 2:**  
The speed was very consistent. There were no sudden stops or starts, which I think is good. Also, when turning, there were no sharp or fast turns that made you feel like you were being thrown around. It felt smooth.

**Speaker 1:**  
So, it maintained a constant speed?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, and it slowed down well in advance when approaching a red light.

**Speaker 1:**  
How did you feel about the U-turn?

**Speaker 2:**  
The only issue was that the turn felt a bit too wide.

**Speaker 1:**  
What do you mean by that? How should it have been done?

**Speaker 2:**  
The road is relatively narrow, with only two lanes. The driver made a slight right turn before making a wide U-turn to minimize the turning radius.

**Speaker 1:**  
But you felt the turn was too wide?

**Speaker 2:**  
I'm not sure if the driver turned the wheel fully.

**Speaker 1:**  
Overall, how do you think the U-turn was handled?

**Speaker 2:**  
It was handled normally, nothing out of the ordinary.

**Speaker 1:**  
Were you worried about hitting the greenery?

**Speaker 2:**  
A little bit. From my angle, it seemed quite close to the greenery.

**Speaker 1:**  
Did you worry about hitting the cars in front?

**Speaker 2:**  
No, the cars were quite far away.

**Speaker 1:**  
So, the distance was safe?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, but each car's front end is different, so I wasn't entirely sure.

**Speaker 1:**  
So, it was the unfamiliarity with the car model that made you a bit concerned?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, mainly because I'm not familiar with this car model.

**Speaker 1:**  
But the driver did a good job?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, the most important thing is that the speed was slow, which is the best.
**Speaker 1:**
So, how familiar are you with this car model?

**Speaker 2:**
Not very familiar, mainly because I haven't driven this model before.

**Speaker 1:**
But the driver did a good job, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the most important thing is that the speed was slow, which is the best.

**Speaker 1:**
So, the driver kept the speed slow enough. Did you worry about hitting any buses?

**Speaker 2:**
No, not at all.

**Speaker 1:**
This section of the road was quite bumpy, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the road was uneven, and there were some bumps.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think the driver consciously slowed down to improve passenger comfort after the bumps?

**Speaker 2:**
No, he maintained a constant speed.

**Speaker 1:**
Did the bumps significantly affect your comfort?

**Speaker 2:**
A little bit, due to the road conditions.

**Speaker 1:**
When you felt the bumps, did you feel more unsafe or just uncomfortable? You weren't worried about safety, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Right, I wasn't worried about safety.

**Speaker 1:**
How did the driver handle the intersection?

**Speaker 2:**
We both looked to the right together, haha.

**Speaker 1:**
You and the driver both checked the right side?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, we both looked.

**Speaker 1:**
And then, since there was no one, you proceeded. So, you think the driver was quite cautious?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because I usually drive very cautiously myself. He noticed a mobility scooter on the right and honked the horn.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think that was a good approach?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, absolutely no problem with that.

**Speaker 1:**
Did he slow down when passing the mobility scooter? And what about pedestrian crossings?

**Speaker 2:**
He checked in advance. There was no one, and his overall speed wasn't very fast.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think his speed was? Did you check the speedometer?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't check, but it was definitely below 40 km/h, probably around 30 km/h.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel that speed was too slow?

**Speaker 2:**
No, the speed was just right. In city traffic, the road conditions are quite complex, so this speed was appropriate.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you have any concerns on this stretch of road?

**Speaker 2:**
No, this section was fine because the visibility was good and there were fewer cars.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you notice the driver accelerating?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, he did accelerate a bit more compared to the previous section.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about his driving after he accelerated?

**Speaker 2:**
He maintained a steady speed after accelerating.

**Speaker 1:**
How did he handle the speed bumps?

**Speaker 2:**
Sometimes he would slow down for the speed bumps.
**Speaker 1:**
When the car accelerates, does it maintain a constant speed?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but when it goes over speed bumps, it can be a bit rough. There are many speed bumps on this road, and they can cause frequent jolts because of their thickness.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think the driver should slow down when approaching these speed bumps? It seems like it would be more comfortable.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I think so. The bumps can be quite jarring if the driver doesn't slow down.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you felt uncomfortable because the driver didn't slow down?

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly. The bumps made the ride quite rough.

**Speaker 1:**
Did the driver accelerate and decelerate appropriately?

**Speaker 2:**
Not always. For example, at the upcoming turn, the driver didn't signal early enough.

**Speaker 1:**
Did the driver signal at all?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but it was a bit late. The sudden acceleration and deceleration were also noticeable, especially when waiting at a red light.

**Speaker 1:**
How did the driver handle passing a tricycle? Was the distance safe?

**Speaker 2:**
The distance was a bit close, but it was due to the road conditions. The left lane was temporarily open, so the driver used it to pass the tricycle. It would have been safer to slow down a bit more to avoid any sudden movements from the tricycle.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel unsafe because of the close distance?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it felt a bit unsafe. The driver could have maintained a safer distance.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think the driver should have driven slower in these situations?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, or at least honked to alert the cyclists.

**Speaker 1:**
Could the driver have moved more to the left to avoid the bumps?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, moving to the left would have helped avoid some of the bumps.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it was possible to avoid the bumps?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was possible.

**Speaker 1:**
Did the driver slow down because of a bump just now?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the driver made a left turn to avoid it.

**Speaker 1:**
I noticed a camera just now. Did the road conditions affect the driver's performance?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the road was not in good condition, which made it difficult.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think the driver's mistakes were due to the poor road conditions?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the bumps were not always severe, but they were frequent enough to cause discomfort.
**Speaker 1:** Do you think this could have been avoided?

**Speaker 2:** Poor road conditions, sometimes the bumps aren't that big, but if you're looking at it from a 4G perspective, you can't really see them. So, it's actually unavoidable unless you go really slow, which would be a bit strange.

**Speaker 1:** But the steering wheel still feels these bumps, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, you can feel the bumps. 

**Speaker 1:** It's not comfortable when the road conditions are bad.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, you can see it on the camera. 

**Speaker 1:** Were you worried about non-motorized vehicles or pedestrians suddenly appearing at this intersection?

**Speaker 2:** Not really, because the speed wasn't that fast, and we were slowing down at that point.

**Speaker 1:** Still bumpy, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, the whole road was bumpy. If I kept pressing the handle, it would be a lot.

**Speaker 1:** You kept pressing it?

**Speaker 2:** Yes.

**Speaker 1:** The road isn't big, but at this spot...

**Speaker 2:** This spot is quite obvious.

**Speaker 1:** There were about 20 people, and 10 turned right. So, I felt the driver handled it well.

**Speaker 1:** It felt safe, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, the driver was quite cautious.

**Speaker 1:** How did the slow right turn make you feel?

**Speaker 2:** Steady and cautious.

**Speaker 1:** Safe. Did you have any other feelings on this road? It seemed quite open and without much traffic. Did you wish the driver would go faster?

**Speaker 2:** No, I didn't.

**Speaker 1:** It felt like normal driving, right? No bumps here.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it was smooth. The camera seemed to capture something earlier. Do you remember feeling anything when the vehicle passed by?

**Speaker 1:** I can't recall.

**Speaker 2:** No, I don't remember anything specific.

**Speaker 1:** So, you felt quite at ease on that road?

**Speaker 2:** Yes.

**Speaker 1:** You didn't worry about it?

**Speaker 2:** No.

**Speaker 1:** When the driver made the right turn and pressed the handle, it bumped again. There were four more bumps. How did you feel on this road?

**Speaker 2:** It was the same road as before, still bumpy.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think the driver could have avoided the bumps the second time around?

**Speaker 2:** No, it's unavoidable.

**Speaker 1:** Why not?

**Speaker 2:** Because the road is wavy. Even if you slow down, unless you go extremely slow, you can't avoid feeling the bumps.

**Speaker 1:** So, it's not the driver's fault.
**Speaker 1:** So, even if you slow down on that wavy road, unless you reduce the speed significantly, you won't really feel much difference.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. The issue isn't really with the driver's skills but more with the road conditions.

**Speaker 1:** We should make a left turn up ahead.

**Speaker 2:** Another left turn?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, why are we braking here?

**Speaker 2:** It seems like there's a car braking ahead.

**Speaker 1:** Is it to avoid that black car?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, that's right. Do you think the driver could have anticipated it earlier?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, they could have started preparing to avoid it earlier, especially since it's an intersection.

**Speaker 2:** They could have reacted a bit sooner, especially since there are no traffic lights here. In such cases, it's common to stop directly at the intersection.

**Speaker 1:** Were you worried about safety?

**Speaker 2:** No, because the speed was still very slow.

**Speaker 1:** And when we passed that black car, you didn't feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:** No, because the speed was very slow. For me, personally, I usually drive a bit faster and I'm not very sensitive to speed, so this speed felt quite slow to me.

**Speaker 1:** I understand.

**Speaker 2:** But I could still feel the bumps.

**Speaker 1:** Was it because of the bumps here?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. And then there was a sudden acceleration afterward. It felt like a jolt.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel it was too much?

**Speaker 2:** Maybe I was overthinking it.

**Speaker 1:** Everything felt normal here.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because the road conditions were better.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about the right turn here?

**Speaker 2:** It was a bit sharp, but I was watching closely.

**Speaker 1:** Was it a normal turn?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it was a normal turn. The turn was smooth and controlled.

**Speaker 1:** The speed was slow, and the turn was not too sharp.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:** How about the U-turn here?

**Speaker 2:** It felt normal. We should be waiting for the traffic light up ahead.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel any discomfort?

**Speaker 2:** Just a little bit of pressure.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:** No, I only feel unsafe when the speed is uncontrollable.

**Speaker 1:** The U-turn felt normal too?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it was normal.

**Speaker 1:** Great.
**Speaker 1:**
When he made that U-turn...

**Speaker 2:**
Yes.

**Speaker 1:**
It was quite normal. Okay.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, right. You just need to add some practice. The road was wide, so it wasn't that...

**Speaker 1:**
Urgent. Hmm, there were many oncoming police cars. Were you worried about hitting them? 

**Speaker 2:**
No, no, no. Because the distance was far enough, or...

**Speaker 1:**
Because the distance was far enough? The speed was slow enough? The safety distance was large enough?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the distance was far enough, and the speed was slow enough. The safety distance was large.

**Speaker 1:**
What about here?

**Speaker 2:**
It was a bit tight, but because we saw the car in advance, it was okay.

**Speaker 1:**
Because the other driver was watching, and he was also...

**Speaker 2:**
Watching, so we were also watching.

**Speaker 1:**
Did the driver slow down? It didn't seem like he slowed down much.

**Speaker 2:**
He didn't slow down much.

**Speaker 1:**
But shouldn't he have slowed down?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, he should have slowed down. He really should have.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel unsafe at that moment, even though the other driver was watching you?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it should be considered unsafe. It can be counted as unsafe because it actually should be.

**Speaker 1:**
When he didn't slow down, did you feel uncomfortable? Anxious, right?

**Speaker 2:**
No, not really.

**Speaker 1:**
When making a right turn...

**Speaker 2:**
Because there was a car in front dropping off passengers, so he made a wide turn.

**Speaker 1:**
After that, when he reversed, was there anything special?

**Speaker 2:**
At that position, he should have yielded to pedestrians. Yes, later on.

**Speaker 1:**
At the parking spot.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it should be.

**Speaker 1:**
That's all. We have a few more questions. Besides the scenarios marked by the handle, do you think the driver had any other dangerous maneuvers?

**Speaker 2:**
Sometimes he didn't slow down enough.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think makes driving safer?

**Speaker 2:**
It's about being cautious. Whenever you encounter pedestrians or intersections, you must slow down, regardless of whether you see anyone. Also, whether it's a small car or a pedestrian, if you can't predict their future path, you should reduce your speed.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, you should also practice defensive driving. Assume others will break the rules. Assume others might crash into you.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
If you can really do that, there won't be any accidents.

**Speaker 1:**
In reality. When you ride in someone else's car, what behaviors from the driver make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**
Not maintaining a safe distance. Not maintaining a safe distance, and sudden acceleration or deceleration. Also, changing lanes without signaling. Anything else? Suddenly cutting in, suddenly changing lanes, and suddenly...
**Speaker 1:** So, what bothers you the most about other drivers' behavior?

**Speaker 2:** Well, there are several things. For instance, sudden lane changes without signaling, abruptly cutting across multiple lanes, and other unpredictable maneuvers.

**Speaker 1:** Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** There are many, but those are the main ones.

**Speaker 1:** Besides those issues, are there any other driving behaviors that make you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, both psychologically and physically. Any actions by the driver that cause discomfort.

**Speaker 1:** Can you give an example?

**Speaker 2:** For instance, not maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles. That makes me feel particularly unsafe.

**Speaker 1:** What do you think makes a good driver?

**Speaker 2:** A good driver respects the safety of others. They avoid actions that cause discomfort to passengers.

**Speaker 1:** Do you consider yourself an experienced driver or a novice?

**Speaker 2:** I would say I'm an experienced driver.

**Speaker 1:** What do you think is the biggest difference between experienced and novice drivers?

**Speaker 2:** Experienced drivers avoid aggressive driving and maintain a safe following distance. They also don't engage in road rage.

**Speaker 1:** Have you ever tried autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:** I know about assisted driving and fully autonomous driving, but I haven't tried them.

**Speaker 1:** What do you think autonomous cars can't do as well as human drivers?

**Speaker 2:** Currently, object recognition is still a challenge for autonomous vehicles.
**Speaker 1:** Can self-driving cars ever behave like humans?

**Speaker 2:** At the current stage, there's still an issue with object recognition.

**Speaker 1:** Object recognition, right.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, the recognition isn't precise enough.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think this problem can be overcome in the future, or do you believe that self-driving cars will never be able to fully replicate human driving?

**Speaker 2:** They can't fully replace humans.

**Speaker 1:** Right, there are things they will never be able to do.

**Speaker 2:** Actually...

**Speaker 1:** They can do everything. Just...

**Speaker 2:** Theoretically.

**Speaker 1:** But not at the current stage.

**Speaker 2:** The reason for that is because road conditions are unpredictable, and other cars are uncontrollable. If all cars were controllable, then I think it could be achieved. Especially if there were no other obstacles like cats, dogs, or other animals on the road, it would be entirely possible.

**Speaker 1:** So you think if all cars were self-driving, it could be achieved. Do you think the recent trip was driven by a human or by an autonomous system?

**Speaker 2:** The recent trip...

**Speaker 1:** Yes, the segment in the video.

**Speaker 2:** Let me think about the entire process and road conditions. It was driven by a human.

**Speaker 1:** Driven by a human. Why are you so sure?

**Speaker 2:** Because there were some minor flaws.

**Speaker 1:** You think self-driving should be more perfect than human driving.

**Speaker 2:** If it were self-driving, at the current stage, I guess it would brake more abruptly in certain situations. Human drivers can anticipate better, whereas AI driving sometimes can't fully predict the paths of pedestrians or other vehicles.

**Speaker 1:** But today...

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I think if it were truly AI driving...

**Speaker 1:** Now, let's assume the recent trip was driven by an autonomous system, with a safety driver pretending to drive. How would this compare to your usual riding experience?

**Speaker 2:** Normally, when riding, it should be...

**Speaker 1:** Too cautious.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because normally people don't drive that slowly.

**Speaker 1:** What other details made you think it might not be a human driving?

**Speaker 2:** Let me think... okay.

**Speaker 1:** If there aren't any, that's fine.

**Speaker 2:** If there's one difference, it's that when a child crossed the road...

**Speaker 1:** It didn't slow down. When it turned, it was smooth but too slow. Right. One last question: as a pedestrian, when you need to cross an intersection without traffic lights, how do you judge the oncoming vehicles?
**Speaker 1:**  
So, the last question is, as a pedestrian, how do you judge the intentions of oncoming vehicles when you need to cross an intersection without traffic lights?

**Speaker 2:**  
Well, you look at the car's signals. Besides the signals, there's not much else to go on. So, as a pedestrian, how do I judge the vehicles' intentions? Yes.

**Speaker 1:**  
You mean by looking at the car's lights, right?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, by looking at the car's lights. Do you mean during the day?

**Speaker 1:**  
Yes, by looking at the signal lights. So, how would you choose to cross the street in this situation?

**Speaker 2:**  
I would wait until there are fewer cars. If there are still too many cars, I would...

**Speaker 1:**  
You would stay put and wait until there are fewer cars, right?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**  
Alright, let me check if there's anything else I haven't asked.

**Speaker 2:**  
Is there anything missing?

**Speaker 1:**  
No, that's all. Thank you very much for participating in our experiment today.
