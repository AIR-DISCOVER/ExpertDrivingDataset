**Speaker 1:**
Before we start watching the video, I would like to ask you a few questions about your daily travel habits. Do you often travel by car?

**Speaker 2:**
Not very often.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you usually take long trips or short trips?

**Speaker 2:**
Usually, it's around a 30 to 40-minute journey. Is that considered long or short?

**Speaker 1:**
A 30 to 40-minute journey? Okay. How did you feel about the ride during this experiment?

**Speaker 2:**
It was quite comfortable. I didn't feel any discomfort.

**Speaker 1:**
How would you rate the driver's skills?

**Speaker 2:**
Very good. Specifically, the driver was very cautious and made smooth turns without any abrupt movements.

**Speaker 1:**
What about the speed?

**Speaker 2:**
The speed was relatively slow, which made me feel safe.

**Speaker 1:**
If you had to choose, what type of car would you prefer for traveling?

**Speaker 2:**
Are you asking about the car or the driver?

**Speaker 1:**
The car.

**Speaker 2:**
I generally prefer family cars that are more comfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
Family cars?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, like SUVs.

**Speaker 1:**
SUVs, sedans, or off-road vehicles?

**Speaker 2:**
SUVs might be more comfortable. I generally like them, even though I don't own one.

**Speaker 1:**
Why do you prefer SUVs?

**Speaker 2:**
Because they have more space and feel more stable when driving in the city compared to off-road vehicles. They also offer more space and comfort compared to sedans.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you prefer gasoline cars or electric cars?

**Speaker 2:**
If we're just talking about the ride, I would prefer electric cars because they are quieter and feel smoother overall.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you mean by smoother?

**Speaker 2:**
The ride feels less bumpy, probably because of the reduced noise, which might have a psychological effect.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you drive yourself?

**Speaker 2:**
I don't drive much. I have a license, but I've completely forgotten how to drive.

**Speaker 1:**
How would you rate your driving skills?

**Speaker 2:**
Not good at all. I can't drive anymore.

**Speaker 1:**
Next, I will play the video of our recent drive. If you notice any moments where your experience changes, please let me know.

**Speaker 2:**
Do you mean if my current feelings differ from what I felt at the time?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, if you recall any moments where your experience changed, especially in specific road conditions.
**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel differently at that moment? Or was it the same?

**Speaker 2:**
It was fine. Before starting, I felt a bit anxious, but once we got going, I felt more at ease.

**Speaker 1:**
Why did you feel anxious before starting?

**Speaker 2:**
I wasn't sure about the driver's skill level, so I felt a bit uneasy.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you observe the driver during the start?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really, no.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you usually observe the driver when you're a passenger?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I do. But usually, I'm in cars driven by people I know, so I have an idea of their driving skills. Today, I felt a bit anxious because I didn't know the driver's skill level. But once we started and took the first turn, I felt more reassured.

**Speaker 1:**
Was the first turn okay?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was. Initially, it felt like he made a lot of turns, but it was fine.

**Speaker 1:**
How could you tell that the driver was skilled?

**Speaker 2:**
It's hard to explain specifically, but the overall drive felt smooth and steady. He didn't hesitate, but he was cautious.

**Speaker 1:**
When you say smooth, do you mean he maintained a constant speed or drove lightly?

**Speaker 2:**
He maintained a constant speed and didn't hesitate. He didn't stop and look around nervously. He was cautious but confident.

**Speaker 1:**
That's good. Did you observe where the driver was looking while you were in the front passenger seat?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I did. From the driving trajectory, I could tell he wasn't hesitating.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel during that segment?

**Speaker 2:**
I felt very relaxed.

**Speaker 1:**
Why did you feel relaxed?

**Speaker 2:**
I think it was because I was initially worried and anxious, but then I relaxed as the drive continued and I felt more confident in his driving.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you notice other vehicles or non-motorized traffic around you?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I did. I remember a vehicle passing by, and the driver waited for a moment. It was either when we were leaving or coming back.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about the right turn?

**Speaker 2:**
I felt the driver was going very slowly.

**Speaker 1:**
Did the slow speed make you worry about cars coming from behind?

**Speaker 2:**
No, it made me feel safe. Although I did think he could have driven a bit faster, it was very safe overall.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you would have preferred if he drove a bit faster, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes.
**Speaker 1:**
Do you feel that you would prefer the driver to drive a bit faster?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's right. Initially, when I wasn't sure about his driving skills, I preferred him to drive slower. But once I felt confident in his abilities, I hoped he would drive a bit faster.

**Speaker 1:**
So, when you are aware of his driving skills, if he drives slowly, does it affect your comfort as a passenger?

**Speaker 2:**
No, it doesn't affect my comfort.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you feel about the driver's ability to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles while you are sitting in the front passenger seat?

**Speaker 2:**
He does a good job of maintaining a safe distance. By the way, can we go back to the previous point? For example, at the intersection ahead, do you worry about vehicles suddenly coming out?

**Speaker 1:**
Do you worry about vehicles suddenly coming out at intersections?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I don't.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you notice the driver accelerating at that time? Did you feel it?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't notice it. But from the video, it seems quite obvious.

**Speaker 1:**
What were you paying attention to at that time?

**Speaker 2:**
I don't remember, honestly. I wasn't paying attention to the acceleration.

**Speaker 1:**
Were you paying attention to the road conditions?

**Speaker 2:**
I think I noticed the tricycle on the left side. I was a bit worried about it.

**Speaker 1:**
Why were you worried about the tricycle?

**Speaker 2:**
The road conditions were quite complex, with a larger tricycle ahead as well. The road was narrow, so I was a bit afraid of a collision.

**Speaker 1:**
Why didn't you use the handle at that time?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't feel physically uncomfortable. It was more of a mental concern. Rationally, I knew it wouldn't happen, but there was still a slight, hidden worry. It wasn't serious enough to use the handle.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about the driver's speed when passing the tricycle?

**Speaker 2:**
It was fine. He handled it well.

**Speaker 1:**
Were you worried when he entered the main road? For example, were you concerned about cars coming from behind or from the intersection ahead?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I wasn't very worried. Once we got onto the main road, it felt more spacious and easier to drive, so I felt more at ease.

**Speaker 1:**
Was your lack of concern due to the driver's skill or his slow speed?

**Speaker 2:**
Mainly because of his skill. I trust him more now.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think he drives smoothly? How about his braking and speed control?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, he drives smoothly. His braking and speed control are not abrupt. It's very comfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you feel about his driving on straight roads?

**Speaker 2:**
It's quite comfortable.
**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about the smooth acceleration and deceleration?

**Speaker 2:**
It was very comfortable to sit through.

**Speaker 1:**
What about the straight-line driving? How did that feel?

**Speaker 2:**
It felt quite comfortable. The speed was relatively slow, which is good for a road with such conditions. Overall, it was a comfortable experience.

**Speaker 1:**
So, do you generally feel more comfortable and safer when the car is moving slowly?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but comfort and safety don't always go hand in hand. For example, when my dad drives, I sometimes feel he drives too slowly. But with a stranger, a slower speed can feel more comfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
Did the driver accelerate at any point during the trip?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I noticed some acceleration when we were turning back and preparing to enter the parking lot. It was towards the end of the trip, and it felt like the driver was confident.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you notice if the driver followed traffic rules?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I think he did a good job. For instance, during a turn, I checked to see if he crossed the solid line, and he didn't. He followed the rules well.

**Speaker 1:**
Haha, can you point out any specific moments? For example, were you worried when passing the bus?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I wasn't worried. Although, when the minibus ahead of us was making a U-turn, I was a bit concerned because it seemed to be driving aggressively. I was afraid it might hit us.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel we were too close to the minibus? How did the driver handle it?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, we were a bit close. The driver stopped in time and gave way to the minibus to complete its turn. It was handled safely.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about the U-turn? It seemed like it took more than one attempt.

**Speaker 2:**
It was fine. I'm used to it taking two attempts because my dad often does the same.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you observe any cars coming from behind?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't pay attention to that.

**Speaker 1:**
Were you worried about hitting any obstacles?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I was confident in the driver's skills. I didn't think he would make such a basic mistake.

**Speaker 1:**
Could you tell from the start that he was a good driver?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, at least above average. He had the basic skills and didn't make any major errors.

**Speaker 1:**
You mentioned earlier that you felt confident in his driving from the start.
**Speaker 1:** You mentioned earlier that you think he's a good driver, at least above average, and doesn't make basic mistakes. 

**Speaker 1:** When I asked about the start, you said you thought he was a good driver. So, when he first started driving, what specifically made you think he was a good driver?

**Speaker 2:** He drove very smoothly without hesitation, but he was also very cautious.

**Speaker 1:** So, it was very smooth, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, very smooth and straightforward, with a sense of confidence.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about that? The road seemed quite open, but...

**Speaker 2:** I felt he was driving a bit slow, but it didn't feel uncomfortable. It was just a bit unusual, but there was no discomfort, and I didn't think there was anything wrong with his driving.

**Speaker 1:** Did you check his speedometer? What do you think his speed was?

**Speaker 2:** Probably around 30 to 40 km/h.

**Speaker 1:** Thirty to forty, right. Earlier, we talked about how you thought the driver deliberately slowed down for the test.

**Speaker 2:** Yes.

**Speaker 1:** How did you notice that?

**Speaker 2:** Because I felt that when he made the final turn and came back to this intersection, he increased his speed. It felt like he was confident as the test was ending. He could speed up, but he was more cautious earlier, so he drove slower. That's the impression I got.

**Speaker 1:** Did you notice the intersection when he passed through it?

**Speaker 2:** No, I didn't notice the intersection.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about him passing through the intersection? Did he slow down?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, he followed the traffic rules very well at the intersection.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about this road? Although it was quite open, there were many non-motorized vehicles and pedestrians on both sides. Did you feel the driver was avoiding them?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, he was avoiding them. His speed wasn't fast.

**Speaker 2:** He drove slowly almost the entire time until he turned back to this intersection and then gradually increased his speed. He was very cautious.

**Speaker 1:** Did he deliberately slow down when turning?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, he slowed down significantly compared to his speed on the road.

**Speaker 2:** He was clearly avoiding oncoming cars and pedestrians.

**Speaker 1:** What about the overtaking situation earlier?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, there was an overtaking situation.

**Speaker 1:** When he overtook the car in front, did you feel worried? It seemed like we were sandwiched in the middle.

**Speaker 2:** No, I don't remember feeling worried.
**Speaker 1:** Did you feel worried when overtaking on the side, especially since the car in front also started moving? It seemed like we were sandwiched in the middle.

**Speaker 2:** Hmm, not really. I don't even remember that scenario. Maybe I was distracted.

**Speaker 1:** Why were you distracted?

**Speaker 2:** I shouldn't have been looking at other things, maybe buildings or something else.

**Speaker 1:** Why were you distracted and not paying attention to the road conditions?

**Speaker 2:** I guess I was just too relaxed.

**Speaker 1:** So you didn't notice the situation at all. How do you feel about it now, looking back?

**Speaker 2:** A bit worried, because the car did start moving alongside the other car.

**Speaker 1:** If you were put back in that situation, would you have pressed the horn?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I would have lightly pressed it because I would be a bit concerned.

**Speaker 1:** What do you think the driver should have done better in that situation?

**Speaker 2:** Maybe wait for the car to pass if they saw it moving ahead, and then overtake it.

**Speaker 1:** So you think it would be better to wait and not overtake immediately, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, follow the car for a short distance, let the black car pass, and then speed up to overtake it.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about the left turn here? Do you remember this part?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I remember. It felt quite smooth and steady.

**Speaker 1:** So it was a slow and steady turn?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, but after the turn, seeing the narrow road made me a bit worried, but it was fine afterward.

**Speaker 1:** There are a lot of cars parked on both sides here, and the road is narrow. Did you pay more attention to the road conditions here?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I did. I wasn't distracted this time.

**Speaker 1:** Were you worried that a pedestrian might suddenly appear from behind one of the parked cars?

**Speaker 2:** Not really. My main concern was that the car might hit one of the parked cars.

**Speaker 1:** So it wasn't too bad. Did you feel the driver kept a safe distance from the parked cars?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, the distance was normal, not too close but not too far either.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think the driver should have kept a greater distance from the parked cars?

**Speaker 2:** No, I think the distance was fine.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about this small turn?

**Speaker 2:** It felt smooth, and there were fewer cars, so I felt more relaxed.

**Speaker 1:** The driver was still driving slowly here, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes.

**Speaker 1:** Did you notice the driver avoiding the bicycle here?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I noticed it at the time.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel the car accelerating? It seemed a bit faster than before.

**Speaker 2:** I didn't really feel it, but the acceleration wasn't abrupt.
**Speaker 1:**
Did you notice anything at that moment?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I did.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel the acceleration? It seemed a bit faster than before.

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't really feel much, the acceleration wasn't very noticeable. It felt subtle.

**Speaker 1:**
When turning here, did you pay special attention to anything?

**Speaker 2:**
No, it felt the same as usual.

**Speaker 1:**
The road conditions here aren't very complex.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the road is wide, so I wasn't too worried, even though the conditions were a bit more complicated.

**Speaker 1:**
How did the driver perform?

**Speaker 2:**
Pretty well. I felt the turns were very smooth and cautious. The driver was careful to avoid oncoming traffic and obstacles.

**Speaker 1:**
When changing lanes here, the car in front stopped, and another car was coming up beside us. Were you worried?

**Speaker 2:**
No, it felt quite normal to me.

**Speaker 1:**
How about driving straight here? How did that feel?

**Speaker 2:**
It was good, though a bit slow.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you worry about the lane change?

**Speaker 2:**
No, because the road was wide, so I wasn't concerned.

**Speaker 1:**
Also because the driver was driving slowly?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel anything here? We seemed close to that van.

**Speaker 2:**
I got distracted looking at the building on the side, which made me feel a bit carsick. I need to look straight ahead to avoid motion sickness. I was staring at it for too long, which caused the discomfort.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you were mostly looking straight ahead, except for that moment?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I glanced to the right for a bit too long, probably over 20 seconds.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you notice the road conditions here?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't.

**Speaker 1:**
How about now? It seems like...

**Speaker 2:**
There’s a garbage truck on the left and another vehicle on the right.

**Speaker 1:**
What should the driver do in this situation?

**Speaker 2:**
Is the car on the right moving or stationary? It looks like it's about to start moving.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, it seems like it's about to start.

**Speaker 2:**
It might be okay, but to be more cautious, the driver could let the van pass first.

**Speaker 1:**
If you were driving, what would you do?

**Speaker 2:**
I'm not very skilled, so I would definitely let it pass first.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think the driver should let it pass?

**Speaker 2:**
I think it's fine either way, but being cautious wouldn't hurt.
**Speaker 1:** So, you think the driver should let the other vehicle pass first?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I think so. Although, I feel it's not a very serious issue. If he lets the cargo truck pass, I think that's enough and I'm satisfied with that.

**Speaker 1:** Is it because the cargo truck was closer or faster?

**Speaker 2:** Faster.

**Speaker 1:** It was driving fast?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, this one didn't seem to be a threat as it was moving forward slowly, so it didn't pose a significant danger.

**Speaker 1:** I have a question. There were two pedestrians ahead. Do you think the driver was close to them?

**Speaker 2:** No, not close. It felt fine.

**Speaker 1:** When turning right, we saw an electric bike on the right side. Did you notice it?

**Speaker 2:** I think I saw it, but it didn't feel very close.

**Speaker 1:** The driver was driving slowly, so you didn't feel there was an issue?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, probably because he made a wide turn and was very cautious. I didn't think there would be a collision, so I didn't pay much attention.

**Speaker 1:** Are you feeling car sick here?

**Speaker 2:** Not yet. I usually start feeling sick after a while, so I need to get to the main road to feel better.

**Speaker 1:** Did you have any special feelings about this section?

**Speaker 2:** No, I remember at the next intersection, he yielded to an electric bike while turning. I thought that was very good.

**Speaker 1:** He actively yielded to other vehicles?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it made me feel very safe.

**Speaker 1:** How was his turning speed?

**Speaker 2:** It was good, very slow and cautious.

**Speaker 2:** He also slowed down for crossing pedestrians.

**Speaker 1:** And he made a clear steering action. You remember he yielded to an electric bike at a certain intersection, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, the electric bike was not following the rules and rushed forward, so he stopped immediately. I don't remember which intersection, but from that point, he gradually increased his speed.

**Speaker 1:** Did you worry about any cars suddenly coming over?

**Speaker 2:** No, I felt he would yield to us.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about his turning here?

**Speaker 2:** Very cautious, no issues at all.

**Speaker 1:** So, overall, you felt safe with his driving?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I felt very safe throughout.
**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about the turn here?

**Speaker 2:**
It was very cautious. Overall, there were no issues during the turn.

**Speaker 1:**
So, the evaluation is the same for all turns, right? Did you also check the cars on the left?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I did glance at them and then looked back.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you would look at the cars on the left along with the driver?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you notice the speed increase here?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was noticeably faster.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think this speed is better, or was the slower speed better?

**Speaker 2:**
I feel more confident with this speed. I trust the driver, and I believe that driving at this speed won't cause any issues. So, a bit faster feels more comfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
So, knowing the driver's skill level, you think this is an area for improvement. We can skip the part where we wait at the red light. How did you feel about the U-turn?

**Speaker 2:**
I was a bit worried that he might turn onto the main road.

**Speaker 1:**
You were worried about turning onto the main road?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but he didn't make a mistake, so I wasn't worried anymore.

**Speaker 1:**
What made you think he might turn onto the main road?

**Speaker 2:**
He was moving slowly, and I thought he was preparing to make the U-turn. But he was actually moving slowly to turn onto the side road. It was fine because I heard the navigation directing him to the side road.

**Speaker 1:**
So, were you observing if the driver was following the navigation?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because there was a chance he might take the wrong route.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you were checking if the driver was following the correct route?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I was also listening to the navigation.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel here?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't pay much attention to this part.

**Speaker 1:**
What were you focusing on at that moment?

**Speaker 2:**
I was thinking about finding a restroom, haha.

**Speaker 1:**
Did the driver slow down when passing the bicycles?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, he did. There were two pedestrians ahead, and I was a bit worried, but he slowed down quickly.

**Speaker 1:**
Were those the two pedestrians from earlier?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the ones at the very front.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel the driver was concerned about that car?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't feel he was worried. I think the driver should have yielded to that black car.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think the black car was about to start moving?

**Speaker 2:**
Oh, I didn't really notice that.

**Speaker 1:**
You didn't notice?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I just felt there was a car there, but it wasn't a big issue.
**Speaker 1:**
So, did you notice anything unusual during the drive?

**Speaker 2:**
Oh, no, I didn't really pay much attention to that.

**Speaker 1:**
You didn't notice anything?

**Speaker 2:**
Right, I just felt like there was a car nearby, but then there was an evasive maneuver. I think, but I'm not entirely sure.

**Speaker 2:**
I vaguely remember there were two new drivers involved? Maybe I'm mistaken, but it's not a big deal.

**Speaker 1:**
Oh, were these the two you mentioned?

**Speaker 2:**
Yeah, I think there were two women, and they crossed in front of the car. The car stopped to let them pass.

**Speaker 1:**
So, the driver did avoid them, right? And that's where the video ends. But I have a few more questions for you. How did the driver handle speed bumps or manhole covers during the drive?

**Speaker 2:**
Pretty well, actually. The driver slowed down, so there wasn't any significant jolting or discomfort.

**Speaker 1:**
So, just normal bumps, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was below the normal level of discomfort. It felt quite smooth.

**Speaker 1:**
Did the driver seem to care about the passengers' comfort?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, definitely.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you notice if the driver ever used the handbrake or did anything risky during the drive?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't really watch the driver closely.

**Speaker 1:**
So, from what you observed, the driving was cautious?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, very cautious.

**Speaker 1:**
What behaviors from other drivers make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**
Accelerating too quickly.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
Taking sharp turns or sudden stops and starts. Those make me uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
Using a phone while driving, definitely.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think makes driving safer?

**Speaker 2:**
First, paying full attention. Then, driving smoothly without sudden stops or starts. If the driver isn't confident, I'd prefer they drive a bit slower.

**Speaker 1:**
Did the driver do anything that made you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
No, nothing made me uncomfortable. Even if they drove slowly, it didn't bother me.

**Speaker 1:**
What behaviors from other drivers make you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Smoking while driving, for sure.

**Speaker 1:**
And in terms of driving itself?

**Speaker 2:**
Sudden stops and starts.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
That's about it.
**Speaker 1:**
So, regarding driving...

**Speaker 2:**
Regarding driving, for example, there are times when...

**Speaker 1:**
Hmm, anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
Also, there are instances of frequent lane changes.

**Speaker 1:**
Frequent lane changes.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it gives me a sense of dizziness because I get carsick easily.

**Speaker 1:**
Oh, I see. Do you often feel carsick when riding in other people's cars?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because I can't help but look at my phone or the scenery on the side. Actually, if I sit in the front passenger seat and look ahead, I won't feel dizzy, but otherwise, I do.

**Speaker 1:**
Hmm, does sitting in the back seat make it worse?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, in the back seat, I have to lean forward and look ahead, which is quite troublesome.

**Speaker 1:**
Are there any other driving behaviors that make you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Sometimes drivers don't slow down for speed bumps.

**Speaker 1:**
Hmm, right. So, what kind of driving makes you feel more comfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Smooth driving, definitely. Overall, not being in a rush, not frequently changing lanes, and slowing down for speed bumps would make the ride more comfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
Hmm, what do you think makes a good driver?

**Speaker 2:**
First, ensuring safety is the most important. Second, trying to make the ride as comfortable as possible for the passengers. These are the main points.

**Speaker 1:**
Hmm, do you consider yourself a novice driver or an experienced one?

**Speaker 2:**
I might be worse than a novice driver because I feel like I've forgotten how to drive.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think there's a gap between you and novice drivers?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I need to get familiar with the gas and brake pedals again.

**Speaker 1:**
Have you forgotten?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it's been three years since I got my driver's license, and I haven't driven since. I only got it to help my family with demerit points.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you've forgotten how to drive.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think is the biggest difference between you and experienced drivers?

**Speaker 2:**
Experienced drivers can clearly distinguish between the brake and gas pedals.

**Speaker 1:**
But even novice drivers can do that, right?

**Speaker 2:**
The bigger difference might be that I see driving as just completing a task, like getting from point A to point B. The process doesn't matter much to me. Experienced drivers can make the journey smooth, like a well-drawn curve, while mine might be more like a straight or jagged line.

**Speaker 1:**
Have you ever experienced autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:**
What do you mean by experienced? I've done some VR experiments.

**Speaker 1:**
I mean, have you ever been in a real autonomous vehicle?

**Speaker 2:**
We have cars with assisted driving features, like parking assistance.
**Speaker 1:**
So, do you have any real experience with autonomous driving vehicles at home?

**Speaker 2:**
We have some assistance features in our car, like parking assistance.

**Speaker 1:**
Have you used them? How do you find them?

**Speaker 2:**
I don't feel much difference in my experience, but my father, who is the main driver, finds it very convenient.

**Speaker 1:**
Based on your understanding of autonomous driving, what aspects do you think autonomous cars can never match human drivers?

**Speaker 2:**
I don't think there are any aspects they can't match, but I believe we are still far from achieving that level. However, I think it will be possible in the future.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think autonomous cars will eventually perform better than human drivers?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I do.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think the recent trip you took was driven by a human or by an autonomous vehicle?

**Speaker 2:**
I think it was driven by a human.

**Speaker 1:**
Why do you think so?

**Speaker 2:**
Because there were noticeable changes in speed.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, there were speed changes.

**Speaker 2:**
And I could see the driver's movements matching the car's movements. I could see the steering wheel being controlled, and it felt consistent.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you were specifically observing whether it was autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I wasn't specifically checking for that.

**Speaker 1:**
If it was indeed autonomous driving and the driver was just a safety officer, how would that change your experience?

**Speaker 2:**
If I knew it was autonomous driving, I might have paid more attention to the details. But as a passenger, I didn't notice anything unusual.

**Speaker 1:**
If it was autonomous driving, what would you expect it to feel like?

**Speaker 2:**
I would expect it to be less smooth, with some abrupt stops and starts based on my limited understanding.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it felt like someone was deliberately controlling the car?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's the feeling I got.

**Speaker 1:**
One last question: As a pedestrian, if you need to cross an intersection without traffic lights, how do you judge the intentions of the drivers and cyclists?

**Speaker 2:**
My strategy is to slow down and signal to the drivers that I intend to cross, to ensure my safety. But judging their intentions can be quite difficult.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you judge their intentions if they don't see your signal?

**Speaker 2:**
If they don't see my signal, I would wait for them to pass.
**Speaker 1:** How do you determine the other driver's intention? For example, if you wave at them and they don't see you, then what?

**Speaker 2:** If they don't see me, I will wait for them to pass. I believe they didn't notice me, so I will wave. If they slow down, I will think they saw my signal, and then they will stop.

**Speaker 1:** So, you judge the other driver's intention based on their speed, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I determine it based on whether they slow down or not.

**Speaker 1:** How do you proceed in such situations? If they let you pass, you go; if they don't, you wait. But what if there are many cars, some letting you pass and some not? How do you handle that?

**Speaker 2:** I still wait until someone lets me pass. After all, a few minutes don't make much difference, but getting into an accident would be serious.

**Speaker 1:** So, you prefer to wait at the spot, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I prefer to be safe.

**Speaker 1:** Okay, that's all our questions for today. Thank you very much for participating in our experiment.

**Speaker 2:** Do I need to fill out any questionnaires or anything?

**Speaker 1:** Oh, no, that's not necessary. You're good to go.

**Speaker 2:** Alright, thank you.

**Speaker 1:** I'll walk you out.
