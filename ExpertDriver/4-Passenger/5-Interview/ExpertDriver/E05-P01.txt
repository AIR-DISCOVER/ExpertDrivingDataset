**Speaker 1:**
Alright, please clip this microphone onto your lapel.

**Speaker 1:**
Let's get started. Do you often travel by car?

**Speaker 2:**
Are you referring to public transport or something else?

**Speaker 1:**
It can be any type. What kind of vehicles do you usually use?

**Speaker 2:**
I usually drive myself.

**Speaker 1:**
You drive yourself often. What type of car do you prefer to drive or ride in? For example, do you prefer SUVs, electric cars, or gasoline cars?

**Speaker 2:**
I prefer electric cars and SUVs. Why? Well, my friend drives an electric car.

**Speaker 1:**
I see.

**Speaker 2:**
Electric cars are more economical compared to gasoline cars.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you find the experience of riding in our vehicle today?

**Speaker 2:**
It was alright. 

**Speaker 1:**
Could you be more specific? Was it comfortable, or was it something else?

**Speaker 2:**
The driver was quite steady.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think of the driver's skills?

**Speaker 2:**
Pretty good. 

**Speaker 1:**
And how would you rate your own driving skills?

**Speaker 2:**
Not bad.

**Speaker 1:**
Now, let's review the route you just took. If there were any memorable moments or specific feelings you had during the ride, please let me know.

**Speaker 2:**
Nothing special, but I remember we circled around the Zhongguancun area twice.

**Speaker 1:**
You circled around twice. How did you feel during the turns?

**Speaker 2:**
It felt normal, just like any other turn. We did wait for a while at the entrance, though. I think the driver was paying a fee.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel when entering that road?

**Speaker 2:**
It felt normal. I do remember the driver circling around twice on one road.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about the U-turn?

**Speaker 2:**
The wait was a bit long. Maybe the driver was being extra cautious.

**Speaker 1:**
Did it make you feel uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Now that you mention it, it did feel a bit slow.

**Speaker 1:**
Was it around the area you mentioned earlier?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I remember it was near the Red Building area where we circled twice.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel when the car passed by pedestrians crossing the road?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't feel much. Actually, I can't quite recall, but there was a red...
**Speaker 1:** How did you feel when the car was passing through that area?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't really feel anything. Hmm, let me think. I can't quite remember, but there was a place with a red light, and the car went around twice. I think it was that place. Yes, it went around twice there.

**Speaker 1:** Right? Can you describe that place?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I do remember. The car went around twice, didn't it?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, it went around twice.

**Speaker 2:** Exactly, it went around twice in one spot.

**Speaker 1:** Oh, did you feel anything about the car going around twice?

**Speaker 2:** Not really. I was just wondering why it had to go around twice. OK, OK.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel when the small car suddenly rushed out?

**Speaker 2:** We didn't really notice it. Haha, were you fast-forwarding? The car was moving quite slowly; I almost fell asleep.

**Speaker 1:** How did the driver's actions make you feel when there were bicycles around?

**Speaker 2:** The ride was quite smooth overall. I didn't feel any sudden jerks or anything. Is that right? OK.

**Speaker 1:** We're back to the beginning. There's another short video. Did you notice any dangerous maneuvers by the driver during the whole process?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't notice any.

**Speaker 1:** In your opinion, what driving behavior is safer?

**Speaker 2:** The driver was already going slow enough. Generally, driving at a slower speed is safer.

**Speaker 1:** Are there any other aspects to consider?

**Speaker 2:** The driver should check all directionsâ€”front, back, left, and right. Yes, keep an eye on the road.

**Speaker 1:** When you're a passenger, what kind of driver behavior makes you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:** Driving too fast.

**Speaker 1:** Speeding?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, and sudden braking.

**Speaker 1:** Sudden braking makes people feel uncomfortable, right?

**Speaker 2:** Definitely.

**Speaker 1:** Did the driver do anything that made you feel uncomfortable this time?

**Speaker 2:** No, nothing.

**Speaker 1:** How can a driver make you feel more comfortable?

**Speaker 2:** You mean in general?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, in your daily life.

**Speaker 2:** Just drive smoothly, follow traffic rules, and use navigation.

**Speaker 1:** When you're a passenger, what kind of driver behavior makes you feel uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Speeding.

**Speaker 1:** You mentioned that speeding makes you feel unsafe. Does it also make you feel uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, for example, if the speed limit is exceeded, it definitely feels unsafe.

**Speaker 1:** OK. Are there any other behaviors that make you feel uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Not really. Maybe when the road is narrow, and the driver tries to squeeze through or compete for space.

**Speaker 1:** How do you define comfort in a car ride?
**Speaker 2:**
Not much, really. The road was narrow, and there were situations where we had to squeeze through and compete for space with other vehicles.

**Speaker 1:**
What is your definition of comfort while driving?

**Speaker 2:**
It means a smooth ride without any bumps.

**Speaker 1:**
And how do you define safety in driving?

**Speaker 2:**
Following traffic rules, not swerving left and right, and driving steadily.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright. What do you think makes a driver professional? What qualities or skills are necessary?

**Speaker 2:**
Knowing the traffic rules, maintaining a steady pace, and not speeding unnecessarily.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it. Do you consider yourself a novice or an experienced driver? And what do you think is the biggest difference between you and a novice driver?

**Speaker 2:**
I'm not a novice, but not a veteran either. The biggest difference is that novices might not be familiar with their car's condition. Experienced drivers know their car well.

**Speaker 1:**
Besides familiarity with the car, is there anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
Novices might get nervous sometimes.

**Speaker 1:**
Nervousness. What do you think about the future of autonomous driving? No matter how advanced it gets, what aspects do you think it can never match human drivers?

**Speaker 2:**
I feel that autonomous driving systems react a bit slower. For example, automatic parking systems don't always recognize spaces well.

**Speaker 1:**
Recognition systems.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, they need a perfectly aligned space to park. If there are people nearby or in tight spaces, the system doesn't recognize well.

**Speaker 1:**
Okay, I understand.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think today's driving was done by a human or an autonomous system?

**Speaker 2:**
I thought it was a human driving.

**Speaker 1:**
Oh, why is that?

**Speaker 2:**
I saw the steering wheel being moved constantly.

**Speaker 1:**
So, because there was constant steering, right? Actually, it was an autonomous system, and the driver was just a safety officer for this experiment. How does this compare to your usual experience?

**Speaker 2:**
I haven't experienced this before.

**Speaker 1:**
Compared to your usual rides?

**Speaker 2:**
Not much difference. Maybe a bit slower. It took longer to turn, and the waiting time felt longer.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it felt slower than your usual rides?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but some human drivers are also slow. 

**Speaker 1:**
Was there any moment when you thought it wasn't a human driving, but an autonomous system?

**Speaker 2:**
I always thought it was a human driving.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, thank you for your insights.
**Speaker 1:**
At that moment, did you feel like it wasn't a real person driving, but rather an autonomous system?

**Speaker 2:**
I always thought it was a person driving.

**Speaker 1:**
Could you share your understanding or definition of the intelligence behind autonomous driving? What does it mean to you? How would you define the intelligence of autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:**
Well, does it include voice control? Does it still require human intervention? Nowadays, many cars can be controlled by voice commands, like turning left or right. Is that what you mean? Voice commands are quite convenient.

**Speaker 1:**
Are there any other aspects you consider?

**Speaker 2:**
I'm not too familiar with other aspects. But I think if you can just speak and the car follows all your commands, that would be very convenient.

**Speaker 1:**
Okay, another question. As a pedestrian crossing a street without traffic lights, how do you judge the intentions of nearby vehicles or bicycles? Whether they intend to stop or keep going?

**Speaker 2:**
I look at their speed.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you also consider the reactions of other pedestrians around you?

**Speaker 2:**
Are you asking if I'm driving or walking?

**Speaker 1:**
As a pedestrian.

**Speaker 2:**
I observe what the vehicles are doing. If a car is approaching too fast, I definitely won't cross.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it's mainly about their speed. Would you choose to rush across regardless of the car's speed, or would you wait?

**Speaker 2:**
I would definitely let the car go first.

**Speaker 1:**
Would you slowly cross or wait until all the cars have passed?

**Speaker 2:**
I usually wait until the cars have passed, but it depends on the situation. Generally, I don't rush.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you prefer to stay put and only cross when there are no cars, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes.

**Speaker 1:**
What was your overall experience with this driving session?

**Speaker 2:**
It was very slow, just very slow.

**Speaker 1:**
And stable?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, that concludes our interview. Do you have any other questions or suggestions for us?

**Speaker 2:**
No, just to clarify, was it autonomous driving?

**Speaker 1:**
No, it was human-driven.

**Speaker 2:**
I see. I thought it was slower than usual.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, your perception is correct.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it felt slower than normal.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, got it.
