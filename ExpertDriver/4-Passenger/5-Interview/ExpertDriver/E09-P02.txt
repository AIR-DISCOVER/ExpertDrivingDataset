**Speaker 1:**
Let's start with some general questions. Do you often travel by car?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, quite often recently.

**Speaker 1:**
When you travel by car, is it usually for long distances or short distances?

**Speaker 2:**
Mostly long distances.

**Speaker 1:**
How long is a typical trip? Around 20 kilometers?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, usually about half an hour after work.

**Speaker 1:**
About half an hour after work. How did you find the driving experience during our experiment? How would you rate the driver's skills?

**Speaker 2:**
The driving was very good and smooth.

**Speaker 1:**
I'm recording this on my phone just in case. If you had a choice, what type of car do you prefer to ride in? For example, an SUV, an electric car, a sedan, etc.

**Speaker 2:**
I don't have any specific preferences.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you drive yourself? Do you have a driver's license?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I don't drive.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, let's review the video of our drive. I'll ask you to recall your experience and share any thoughts on the driver's performance and how it affected your ride. Feel free to interrupt me with your observations. I'll also ask about your feelings during certain maneuvers.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about the driver's handling during turns?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't notice anything special.

**Speaker 1:**
Not just this turn, but throughout the drive, did you have any particular feelings about the turns?

**Speaker 2:**
No, everything was very smooth.

**Speaker 1:**
Here, the driver made a right turn onto a side road. Did you have any specific feelings about this maneuver?

**Speaker 2:**
No, it was fine. The driving was steady.

**Speaker 1:**
The driving was steady.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, not rushed at all.

**Speaker 1:**
Not rushed? Okay.

**Speaker 2:**
The road conditions were good, not much traffic.

**Speaker 1:**
If you think the driving was steady, can you elaborate on what made it better than an average driver? Was it because the driver wasn't in a hurry?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the speed was normal, not too slow.

**Speaker 1:**
The speed was normal.
**Speaker 1:** Were you anxious?

**Speaker 2:** No, not really. He was driving at a normal speed.

**Speaker 1:** So, the speed was normal.

**Speaker 1:** There was a unique situation where an elderly lady was pulling a cart and crossing the street. How did the driver's actions make you feel in that situation?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't see any problem. The distance was quite far, so it didn't affect his normal driving.

**Speaker 1:** It didn't affect his normal driving.

**Speaker 2:** Also, the elderly lady crossing the street wasn't an issue. He was driving normally and didn't need to yield at that point.

**Speaker 1:** I noticed that he slowed down in advance. It seemed like there was a deceleration function.

**Speaker 2:** Maybe because I was sitting in the car, I didn't feel the deceleration very clearly.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, the deceleration wasn't very noticeable. And since you were in the back seat, you couldn't see it. So, when he slowed down and slightly steered to the left, you could fully realize it during the drive.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I didn't feel much.

**Speaker 1:** You didn't notice anyone crossing the street ahead?

**Speaker 2:** No, because I wasn't looking ahead.

**Speaker 1:** Now, entering the main road, how did you feel about this process?

**Speaker 2:** It was normal driving, in line with traffic regulations.

**Speaker 1:** Did you notice the driver making any anticipatory checks or similar actions?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't pay attention to the driver's actions.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about the U-turn process?

**Speaker 2:** It was quite comfortable.

**Speaker 1:** Quite comfortable.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, the braking and starting were not abrupt.

**Speaker 1:** Many cars start smoothly. He made the U-turn in one go.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, he did it in one go.

**Speaker 1:** We've conducted many experiments, and many drivers can't make the U-turn in one go here.

**Speaker 2:** They can't make the U-turn in one go?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, because the road is narrow, many drivers have to stop, adjust, and then proceed.

**Speaker 2:** But he didn't need to; he managed it well.

**Speaker 1:** I also think he is quite experienced. His control of the car's distance was spot on.

**Speaker 2:** And his turns weren't abrupt. The turning point was well-chosen.

**Speaker 1:** During the U-turn?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, this way, he didn't need to make additional adjustments.

**Speaker 1:** When you say the turning point was well-chosen, what do you mean?

**Speaker 2:** I mean, right here, he...
**Speaker 1:**
So, you mentioned that by choosing the right position, the driver avoids the need for extra maneuvers.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. By positioning the car correctly, the driver doesn't need to make additional adjustments.

**Speaker 1:**
Could you elaborate on what you mean by choosing the right position?

**Speaker 2:**
In this case, the car in front was positioned slightly ahead, and our driver managed to position our car just right, avoiding the need for extra steering.

**Speaker 1:**
So, on one hand, the driver avoided the car in front, and on the other hand, the initial positioning was good, so no further adjustments were needed. This U-turn was one of the most seamless I've seen in our tests.

**Speaker 2:**
The entire drive was very smooth. There were no sudden stops or abrupt maneuvers.

**Speaker 1:**
When we hire professional drivers, most passengers have similar reactions.

**Speaker 2:**
So, how do you ensure professionalism? What's the process?

**Speaker 1:**
We have set standards. The drivers are usually corporate drivers with a certain amount of driving experience. I don't handle the hiring directly, but they often have experience in handling important guests. By the way, was that honk intentional?

**Speaker 1:**
Now, we're in a steady-speed phase. What do you think about this steady-speed driving?

**Speaker 2:**
It's great, no issues at all. Your route planning is excellent.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, we avoid bad routes. During our tests, the road conditions are usually good.

**Speaker 2:**
I initially thought you would be driving inside the Tsinghua campus.

**Speaker 1:**
This area is more complex because it's an intersection without traffic lights. How did you feel when the driver navigated through it?

**Speaker 2:**
It was very good. The driver made accurate judgments.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you mean by accurate judgments?

**Speaker 2:**
I mean the driver's anticipation of pedestrian movements.

**Speaker 1:**
Anticipation of pedestrian movements?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the driver anticipated that the pedestrian wouldn't cross the road and made the turn smoothly. It felt very seamless.

**Speaker 1:**
After the turn, the driver accelerated straight ahead. How did you find that?

**Speaker 2:**
It was also very smooth.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you think about how this driver differs from regular drivers you usually ride with? This might help you articulate what makes this driver better. Sometimes, regular drivers have bad habits that make the ride uncomfortable or unsafe. How does this driver compare?

**Speaker 2:**
Well, he doesn't chat with passengers, which is good. But do you have a policy about that?
**Speaker 1:** Do you feel unsafe when the driver is not talking to passengers? Is there something this driver does better than others?

**Speaker 2:** Not talking to passengers? Yes, but you require them to stay quiet, right? Also, I usually take these rides after working late, so the roads are pretty empty and easy to drive on. There's not much traffic, so it's not really comparable to other times.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, I understand. Can I call you back later?

**Speaker 1:** Are you almost back?

**Speaker 1:** The camera will capture everything, and then I'll ask you some questions about safety and comfort. Did you notice any dangerous or uncomfortable actions by the driver?

**Speaker 2:** No, there was nothing bad.

**Speaker 1:** How do you think the driver could improve safety or comfort?

**Speaker 2:** By not using equipment.

**Speaker 1:** Not using equipment?

**Speaker 2:** For your experiment, he needs to use a lot of devices. If he didn't have to use them, I think the ride would be more comfortable.

**Speaker 1:** And in terms of safety?

**Speaker 2:** It was quite safe.

**Speaker 1:** When you usually ride with other drivers, not just in this experiment, what behaviors make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:** Speeding. At night, some roads don't have speed cameras, so they speed. Also, not paying attention to driving and chatting with passengers. But I understand, night shift drivers might get sleepy if they don't talk. Anything else? No, that's about it.

**Speaker 1:** What about comfort? Any behaviors that make you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Cleanliness. Some cars, especially taxis, have a smell. If the driver doesn't maintain personal hygiene, it can be unpleasant.

**Speaker 1:** Besides the smell, what about the driver's driving habits?

**Speaker 2:** Especially with taxis, if they are familiar with the roads in Beijing, they tend to speed and overtake recklessly.

**Speaker 1:** Speeding and reckless overtaking?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, that's it.

**Speaker 1:** What makes a driver professional in your opinion? What should they do?

**Speaker 2:** Follow traffic rules and accurately predict the actions of pedestrians and other vehicles.

**Speaker 1:** Their intentions?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, and then make the right judgments and reactions. Anything else? No, that's all.

**Speaker 1:** What do you think is the biggest difference between an experienced driver and a new driver?

**Speaker 2:** The skill level.

**Speaker 1:** Skill level?
**Speaker 1:**
What do you think is the biggest difference between experienced drivers and new drivers?

**Speaker 2:**
Well, it's the proficiency in handling the vehicle.

**Speaker 1:**
Proficiency?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because new drivers are not very familiar with the car and the road. They might drive too slowly or too quickly, or they might brake suddenly. They might also start too quickly, which isn't smooth. Since they are not familiar, they can't accurately predict the actions of other pedestrians and vehicles, leading to sudden braking.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
No, that's about it.

**Speaker 1:**
Now, let's talk about your views on autonomous driving. What aspects do you think autonomous cars can't match human drivers, even in the future?

**Speaker 2:**
They won't be able to match humans in handling complex road conditions.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you elaborate on what you mean by complex road conditions?

**Speaker 2:**
For example, at a busy intersection with many pedestrians, their behavior can be unpredictable and spontaneous. Autonomous driving systems struggle to handle such situations effectively. Also, they are quite mechanical and can't adapt to changing conditions or choose the most suitable route.

**Speaker 1:**
You mean when planning routes?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, they can only follow pre-programmed routes on the map and can't adapt to real-time conditions to choose the best path.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you give an example of how human drivers use their experience to choose better routes?

**Speaker 2:**
For instance, there might be shortcuts not recorded on the map, but local residents know them well. Human drivers can choose these routes to avoid longer, mapped routes.

**Speaker 1:**
So human drivers have this kind of experience.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, and this experience can't be replicated by autonomous systems.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think the car we just saw was driven by a human or was it on autopilot?

**Speaker 2:**
I think it was driven by a human.

**Speaker 1:**
Let's assume it was an autonomous car with a safety driver. Reflecting on your experience, would you feel any difference?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I wouldn't feel any difference.

**Speaker 1:**
So even if it was an autonomous car, your riding experience would be the same?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it would be the same because the road conditions were good, and the driving was smooth.
**Speaker 1:**
Do you feel that your riding experience is still the same?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it's still the same. The road conditions are quite good, and the driver didn't encounter any situations that required special judgment. The performance was quite impressive.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you notice any details during the drive that made you feel like the car was being driven by an automated system rather than a human?

**Speaker 2:**
No, because the driving was very smooth. Also, sitting behind the driver, my observation wasn't very direct or convenient. I was mostly looking out the window and didn't pay much attention to those details.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you didn't really notice the driver's operations?

**Speaker 2:**
Right, I didn't specifically observe or pay attention to them.

**Speaker 1:**
One last question: If you were a pedestrian crossing an intersection without traffic lights, how would you judge the intentions of non-motorized vehicles or cars?

**Speaker 2:**
First, I would look at the distance. If the vehicle is far away, I wouldn't consider it. If it's close, I would observe it. If the driver notices me, they usually yield to pedestrians.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you judge if the driver has noticed you and will yield?

**Speaker 2:**
For example, the driver might make a hand gesture indicating that pedestrians should go first. Also, I would look at the speed of the car. If the car is moving fast, I would wait for it to pass.

**Speaker 1:**
In such road conditions, do you prefer to quickly cross the road or wait until all cars have passed and it's completely clear?

**Speaker 2:**
I prefer to quickly cross the road.

**Speaker 1:**
Even if there are cars, you still?

**Speaker 2:**
I judge the situation. If I can cross before the car reaches me, I will quickly cross. It depends on the speed of the car.

**Speaker 1:**
Speed, got it. We've almost finished our questions. Lastly, do you have any feedback about the driver or your riding experience during this experiment?

**Speaker 2:**
You could put a dark tint on the sunroof.

**Speaker 1:**
Because the sunlight in the afternoon is too bright?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the sunlight can be glaring and a bit hot.

**Speaker 1:**
Understood, I will relay that feedback. Anything else about the driver's operation or your riding experience?

**Speaker 2:**
I think...
**Speaker 1:**
If you understand, I will respond positively. Is there anything else? Anything about the driver's operation or your experience as a passenger?

**Speaker 2:**
I think, um, nothing much, nothing much. Overall, it was quite good.

**Speaker 1:**
It feels like this driver is very professional, almost too much so.

**Speaker 2:**
Hahaha, you could hire Didi drivers or even some aggressive taxi drivers.

**Speaker 1:**
Like those?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, they might have a different style.

**Speaker 1:**
We also hire some regular drivers, and it can be quite different.

**Speaker 2:**
With additional cars, right?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, we have some standards, like the driving experience should not exceed a certain number of years. While ensuring safety, we also hire some less experienced drivers and form different groups. This way, we can understand the differences between them. Alright, we...
