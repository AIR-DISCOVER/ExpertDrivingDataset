**Speaker 1:**
Let's start now. Do you usually travel by car? In Beijing, do you typically take long or short trips? How long are your short trips usually?

**Speaker 2:**
Usually around ten to twenty minutes, sometimes up to half an hour.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you usually take a taxi, or do you drive yourself? How did you find the experience of riding in our vehicle this time?

**Speaker 2:**
It was quite comfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
Comfortable? In what way?

**Speaker 2:**
The new driving style.

**Speaker 1:**
You mean the driver's behavior? Was it smooth driving?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the driving was quite smooth.

**Speaker 1:**
How would you rate the driver's skills?

**Speaker 2:**
The skills were good. The driver was very focused.

**Speaker 1:**
Focused? So, the driver wasn't distracted?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, very cautious.

**Speaker 1:**
If you had to choose, what type of car would you prefer for your trips? For example, an electric car, a gasoline car, or an SUV?

**Speaker 2:**
An electric car, then a gasoline car. Because they are lighter, right?

**Speaker 1:**
Lighter, yes. Do you find them more comfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, comfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you drive yourself? Do you have a driver's license?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I do. I drive quite often.

**Speaker 1:**
Have you driven in Beijing?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I haven't. How do you think your driving skills are?

**Speaker 1:**
Pretty good. Would you consider yourself an experienced driver?

**Speaker 2:**
Moderately experienced.

**Speaker 1:**
Haha, let's take a look at this video of the route we just took. Let me know your thoughts as we go along. How did you feel about this turn?

**Speaker 2:**
The road felt too narrow.

**Speaker 1:**
Did it make you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
It felt narrow, but manageable.

**Speaker 1:**
The screen shows the details, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, especially in the rain, it felt like we might hit the car in front.

**Speaker 1:**
Did it make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really, it felt normal. It's just a visibility issue.

**Speaker 1:**
How about this section of the road?

**Speaker 2:**
The car's acceleration was good, it started smoothly.

**Speaker 1:**
Smooth acceleration?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, unlike some cars that feel different. Each car has its own feel.

**Speaker 1:**
How did the smooth start make you feel?

**Speaker 2:**
It felt good, especially for the driver.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it didn't make you feel rushed?

**Speaker 2:**
No, if the car starts smoothly, it makes driving easier.
**Speaker 1:**
So, you didn't feel rushed at all?

**Speaker 2:**
Right, if the car starts smoothly, you feel more at ease while driving.

**Speaker 1:**
It feels more stable, right? Yes, it doesn't take much time. How do you feel about this place? There's no traffic congestion. Do you feel anxious at all?

**Speaker 2:**
No, it's all about driving skills.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you trust the driver? What do you think about the navigation voice?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it's fine.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you feel about making a U-turn?

**Speaker 2:**
There are a lot of cars.

**Speaker 1:**
How does that make you feel?

**Speaker 2:**
It feels a bit problematic.

**Speaker 1:**
How about the comfort level?

**Speaker 2:**
The comfort level is very good. You just need to pay attention while driving, and there are no issues.

**Speaker 1:**
How was it crossing the pedestrian crossing?

**Speaker 2:**
Everything was normal, just regular driving.

**Speaker 1:**
So, there was nothing particularly memorable about the journey? Any special moments?

**Speaker 2:**
Overall, it was comfortable. What I appreciated the most was the smooth start.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you think there were no drawbacks?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was so comfortable that I almost fell asleep. Maybe it's because of the driver's skills.

**Speaker 1:**
We usually select the information carefully.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was very smooth.

**Speaker 1:**
Were there any sudden brakes?

**Speaker 2:**
No, none at all.

**Speaker 1:**
Would wet road conditions have any impact?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really, it didn't affect the experiment.

**Speaker 1:**
Did the driver do anything that made you feel unsafe or uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
No, nothing like that.

**Speaker 1:**
In your opinion, what constitutes safe driving, aside from this experiment?

**Speaker 2:**
You mean driving?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, what do you think makes driving safer?

**Speaker 2:**
You need to constantly be aware of your surroundings while driving.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you mean pedestrians or other cars?

**Speaker 2:**
Both cars and pedestrians. You also need to consider the traffic conditions, like the number of vehicles. When turning left or right, you must observe your surroundings and make predictions.

**Speaker 1:**
What is your definition of safety?

**Speaker 2:**
Are you asking about driving safety?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, what makes driving safe?

**Speaker 2:**
First, the car itself must be safe.

**Speaker 1:**
The car should be in good condition, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, and you need to be alert and cautious.
**Speaker 1:** For driving safety, first and foremost, your car must be safe.

**Speaker 2:** The car should be in good condition. Yes.

**Speaker 1:** And you yourself should not be in a state of intoxication, right? You need to be sober. Yes, in that kind of state. And then there's the road conditions.

**Speaker 1:** What do you mean by road conditions?

**Speaker 2:** Road conditions? It refers to your surrounding environment. For example, in certain applications, it definitely matters.

**Speaker 1:** You mean in such situations, right?

**Speaker 2:** You shouldn't bump into other cars or hit pedestrians.

**Speaker 1:** Follow traffic rules, right.

**Speaker 2:** All the car parts must be in good condition. Especially in rainy weather, things like windshield wipers, turn signals, fog lights, and other safety lights need to be checked.

**Speaker 1:** Does your car have airbags?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, airbags.

**Speaker 1:** Do you check these things before driving?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I always check the car before driving.

**Speaker 1:** The overall condition of the car, right?

**Speaker 2:** And also check your own physical condition.

**Speaker 1:** Your own physical condition, right. You mentioned being sober, right? Yes, things like that.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, you shouldn't drive if you're tired. And if you're sleepy, you shouldn't drive.

**Speaker 1:** Do you drink Red Bull if you're tired?

**Speaker 2:** No, I don't.

**Speaker 1:** So you just don't drive if you're tired.

**Speaker 2:** If I'm driving, I usually drink mineral water, not soft drinks.

**Speaker 1:** Because you're afraid it might affect your driving state. Yes, exactly. So, when you're a passenger, what behaviors from the driver make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:** Talking too much. Talking too much can affect their concentration.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, right.

**Speaker 2:** And I worry about drivers who have road rage. If someone doesn't yield to them, they get easily angered. Yes, exactly. They call it road rage.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, right.

**Speaker 2:** I'm also concerned about the car's condition because I'm a passenger and haven't checked the car myself.

**Speaker 1:** Do you trust taxi drivers more?

**Speaker 2:** I do trust them because they are regulated and use official apps for rides.

**Speaker 1:** You trust their driving skills.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I trust their skills.

**Speaker 1:** When you're a passenger, what behaviors from others make you uncomfortable, including both drivers and passengers?

**Speaker 2:** Smoking.

**Speaker 1:** Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** ...
**Speaker 1:**
When you're a passenger in someone else's car, what behaviors from others make you feel uncomfortable? This includes both the driver and other passengers.

**Speaker 2:**
Smoking.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, loud talking. The atmosphere inside the car should be calm and quiet.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you play music when you drive?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I do. But when I'm a passenger, I prefer a quieter environment.

**Speaker 1:**
What qualities do you think make a driver professional?

**Speaker 2:**
A professional driver prioritizes safety, strictly follows traffic rules, and drives skillfully.

**Speaker 1:**
What are some signs of a skillful driver?

**Speaker 2:**
For example, a skillful driver will start braking well before reaching a red light, rather than stopping abruptly at the last moment.

**Speaker 1:**
So, maintaining a steady and smooth driving style is important?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. Some drivers accelerate or brake suddenly, which can be very jarring.

**Speaker 1:**
Does that make you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it does. Since I have some driving skills myself, I prefer a smooth ride, even in a ride-share car.

**Speaker 1:**
Have you always been prone to motion sickness?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I've been prone to it since I was a child.

**Speaker 1:**
I used to get motion sickness as a child, but not so much anymore. Maybe I've just gotten used to it. Do you still get motion sickness?

**Speaker 2:**
I used to get it very badly in small cars, but it's not as severe now.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you take motion sickness medication?

**Speaker 2:**
I don't take it anymore, but I used to. Maybe I built up a tolerance to it. For long trips, I might still take it, but not for short ones.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you don't feel the need for it on short trips?

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly. And when I drive myself, I don't get motion sickness at all.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you generally feel during a trip?

**Speaker 2:**
I feel fine as long as the ride is smooth.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think are the main differences between new drivers and experienced drivers?

**Speaker 2:**
New drivers tend to be nervous and anxious, which makes them more prone to accidents. They lack the experience and confidence that seasoned drivers have.

**Speaker 1:**
Experienced drivers are more familiar with driving techniques and traffic rules?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, and they have strong situational awareness and can handle unexpected situations well.

**Speaker 1:**
So, they are better at adapting to sudden changes?

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly. New drivers might struggle with that.
**Speaker 2:**
Then, the ability to adapt quickly is very important.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, the ability to handle sudden situations. Exactly.

**Speaker 2:**
A good driver should be able to adapt and be flexible.

**Speaker 1:**
Is there a definition of comfort for you? Comfort in terms of riding in a car.

**Speaker 2:**
Comfort, first of all, is about your emotional state. When you sit in the car, you should feel good. Secondly, it's about your physical state, like not feeling nauseous or anything.

**Speaker 1:**
Right, like not getting car sick.

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly, one aspect is emotional, and the other is physical.

**Speaker 1:**
Are there any other aspects?

**Speaker 2:**
The external environment. The atmosphere inside the car.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, you mentioned that. What aspects do you think autonomous cars can never achieve like human drivers?

**Speaker 2:**
For example, following traffic rules and responding to traffic accidents. I don't think they can react as quickly.

**Speaker 1:**
Any other aspects?

**Speaker 2:**
They can't pay attention to people's emotions.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think autonomous driving can pay attention to emotions, or is it human drivers who can?

**Speaker 2:**
I think human drivers can notice the emotions of passengers. For instance, if someone is heartbroken and starts crying, a human driver can offer friendly communication. But an autonomous car can't do that.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, we interviewed a passenger who suggested having a button in the car. If a passenger has an emotional reaction, they can press the button, and the autonomous car would respond accordingly. It's an interesting idea.

**Speaker 2:**
Indeed, otherwise, the car can't feel emotions like humans do.

**Speaker 1:**
Right, no emotions. Do you think the trip you just took was driven by a human or an autonomous car?

**Speaker 2:**
Of course, it was driven by a human. Why? Because I could feel it. For example, when we reached a congested area, the driver handled it promptly. Also, the driver made the ride comfortable for us.

**Speaker 1:**
So you feel the driver was attentive to your comfort?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
What if I told you the vehicle you just rode in was actually an autonomous car, and the driver was just a safety officer pretending to drive? Would that change your perception?

**Speaker 2:**
I might still feel...

**Speaker 1:**
A bit worried?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, worried. What if something goes wrong?
**Speaker 1:** How does this experience differ from what you mentioned before?

**Speaker 2:** I might still feel the same.

**Speaker 1:** A bit worried, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, worried. What if it malfunctions? Haha, that's the concern. Previously, it wasn't about a specific brand, but there were issues.

**Speaker 1:** So, you're concerned about safety.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, safety.

**Speaker 1:** Are there any specific details that make you feel like the car might not be driven by a human at any moment?

**Speaker 2:** No, not really.

**Speaker 1:** So, you don't have that feeling at all?

**Speaker 2:** No, I can sense the intelligence in this case.

**Speaker 1:** As a pedestrian, when you cross an intersection without traffic signals, how do you judge the intentions of the vehicles in front of you?

**Speaker 2:** They might...

**Speaker 1:** Cross the road, or...

**Speaker 2:** They might honk at me, or roll down their window, extend their hand, and nod. Something like that.

**Speaker 1:** So, they usually make some sort of gesture. Would you keep moving closer, or wait until all the vehicles have passed before crossing?

**Speaker 2:** I would definitely choose the first option, slowly moving closer. I observe until it's safe, then I cross.

**Speaker 1:** How do you define intelligence in this context?

**Speaker 2:** Intelligence might be the ability to report road conditions in real-time.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, like in autonomous driving, timely reporting.

**Speaker 2:** Road conditions, yes. Also, things like the air conditioning and navigation inside the car.

**Speaker 1:** Mainly related to driving.

**Speaker 2:** If it's intelligent driving, it would report road conditions. What kind of intelligence is that?

**Speaker 1:** How would you describe your experience with autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:** I haven't experienced it. I haven't tried driverless cars, so...

**Speaker 1:** What do you imagine it to be like?

**Speaker 2:** It might be similar to having a driver, but there are differences. I feel safer with a human driver. Without one, I would have psychological concerns.

**Speaker 1:** Why would you be concerned?

**Speaker 2:** Unexpected situations.

**Speaker 1:** You worry it can't handle sudden situations?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I think it's not as flexible as a human. Without a human, it feels less secure.

**Speaker 1:** What are your thoughts on the stability of autonomous driving compared to human driving?

**Speaker 2:** It might be relatively stable, but...
**Speaker 1:**
When it comes to autonomous driving, is the ride smoother compared to human driving, or is it less stable?

**Speaker 2:**
Well, it tends to be relatively smoother. Yes, it operates within a certain range, and its stability is generally within that range. After all, it's designed to be that way.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it takes safety distances into greater consideration?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because when it's programmed, there are specific indicators or range parameters that it adheres to.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright. That brings us to the end of our interview today. Do you have any other questions?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I don't have any more questions.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you have any suggestions for us?

**Speaker 2:**
No, everything seems fine.

**Speaker 1:**
Great. Did you feel comfortable today?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was quite comfortable. There were no issues while driving or being in the car.
