**Speaker 1:**
Let's start with a few questions. Do you often travel by car?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, quite often. Very often, actually.

**Speaker 1:**
How frequently?

**Speaker 2:**
I would say about 3 to 5 times a week.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you usually take short trips or long trips?

**Speaker 2:**
I haven't traveled outside of Beijing, so they are mostly short trips.

**Speaker 1:**
How long do these trips usually last?

**Speaker 2:**
It varies. Sometimes it can be as short as 10 to 20 minutes, and other times it can be as long as 40 minutes to an hour.

**Speaker 1:**
If you had a choice, what type of car do you prefer for traveling? For example, an SUV, a gasoline car, an electric car, or a sedan?

**Speaker 2:**
I definitely prefer a sedan. Why? Because I feel the chassis is more stable, and the comfort level is much better. The overall experience is excellent.

**Speaker 1:**
So, the comfort level is what stands out for you, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it doesn't feel bumpy.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you find the driver's skills during your ride with us?

**Speaker 2:**
I think they were excellent, really impressive.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you elaborate?

**Speaker 2:**
Since I often travel by car, I can say that today's experience was great. The driver's skills were top-notch.

**Speaker 1:**
In what aspects were they good?

**Speaker 2:**
I think the braking, starting the car, and making turns were all handled very well. As a passenger, you don't feel any sudden jolts when the car starts or stops. The driver managed everything very smoothly.

**Speaker 1:**
Very smooth.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, very smooth.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you drive yourself?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I do.

**Speaker 1:**
How would you rate your own driving skills?

**Speaker 2:**
Honestly, I think I'm okay, but compared to this driver, I feel a bit lacking. I tend to drive more aggressively and my stops aren't as smooth. I drive faster.

**Speaker 1:**
How many years have you been driving?

**Speaker 2:**
I've had my license for a long time, but my actual driving experience is about three years.
**Speaker 1:**
How many years have you been driving?

**Speaker 2:**
I've had my driver's license for quite a long time, but in terms of actual driving experience, I'd say around three years.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you consider yourself a novice driver or an experienced one?

**Speaker 2:**
If we're talking about the length of time I've had my license, I should be considered an experienced driver. However, in terms of actual driving practice, I haven't had many opportunities to drive. So, I still feel like a novice driver.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, let's watch this video. If you have any thoughts or memories during this process, feel free to share them with me. I'll also ask you some questions about your feelings. How do you feel about this turn?

**Speaker 2:**
I do have some feelings about this turn. I felt a bit dizzy, like a mild motion sickness. It's not very strong, but it's noticeable.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think this is related to the driver's skills?

**Speaker 2:**
I don't think it's related to the driver's skills. It's more about the road conditions and the environment. This feeling would occur regardless of who is driving.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you describe the road conditions and environment that made you feel dizzy?

**Speaker 2:**
The road isn't a straight, flat one. It requires a lot of turns and angle changes. The car's movement gives passengers a natural, physical reaction, causing a bit of dizziness.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you usually feel this way when turning?

**Speaker 2:**
I don't feel this way when I'm driving myself.

**Speaker 1:**
How about when you're a passenger in someone else's car?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I do feel this way when I'm a passenger.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you often feel this way?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but it's not very strong. I can definitely feel it, though.

**Speaker 1:**
Does this feeling cause you any discomfort?

**Speaker 2:**
It's just a bit of dizziness. It's noticeable but goes away quickly after the turn.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it's a fleeting sensation that doesn't cause you any physical or psychological discomfort?

**Speaker 2:**
No, it doesn't. If I were driving myself, or if it wasn't today...
**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel any discomfort, either physically or mentally, during the drive?

**Speaker 2:**
No, if I were driving myself or if it wasn't in today's specific environment, I might not have felt this strongly. Today, I was highly focused on the environment, which made me pay extra attention to the details, sensations, and overall experience. Normally, I might have some feelings, but they would be negligible.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel anything when making turns in this area?

**Speaker 2:**
In this area, I didn't feel much. Unlike the turn we made downstairs earlier, where I felt something, this turn didn't give me any particular sensation.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel when entering this road?

**Speaker 2:**
I felt great, like the car was entering a broad, smooth road. It felt really good.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you notice a Meituan delivery vehicle passing by just now?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't notice it. Let me show you.

**Speaker 1:**
At this spot, did you feel anything when it passed by?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't feel anything because I didn't notice it.

**Speaker 1:**
This area feels very smooth, right? What kind of smoothness are we talking about? Is it the driving speed?

**Speaker 2:**
I think it's a very natural feeling, like everything is flowing smoothly.

**Speaker 1:**
You didn't notice it?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it just passed by without me noticing. I was ready to enjoy the drive, and then it just happened. From the starting point to the turn, and then onto Chengfu Road, I felt like we were on a major road, ready for a long journey. I was just starting to enjoy it.

**Speaker 1:**
So, this section of the road is very stable, right? How does this stable driving make you feel?

**Speaker 2:**
It makes me feel very comfortable and relaxed. Initially, I was a bit anxious. Before we started, I was wearing a wristband, filling out a questionnaire, and holding onto the handle, wondering if I needed to do something. But once we got onto the main roads, from the small alley to Chengfu Road, I felt like the real journey had begun, and I started to enjoy it.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel when the car passed by?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't feel anything.
**Speaker 1:**
How did it start? 

**Speaker 2:**
It started smoothly. I felt very comfortable and was enjoying the ride.

**Speaker 1:**
When the car approached, how did you feel?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't feel anything.

**Speaker 1:**
You didn't notice it, right?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't notice it because I felt it was a normal situation. I didn't feel anything unusual. How was the car?

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about the U-turn?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't feel anything.

**Speaker 1:**
Not even a little?

**Speaker 2:**
No, my most genuine feeling while sitting in the car was that it started to make a U-turn.

**Speaker 1:**
But I noticed it wasn't a single smooth turn; there was some reversing involved. Did you feel anything about that?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't feel anything special. In my perception, it was just a normal turn. Yes, a normal driving turn.

**Speaker 1:**
Was the car accelerating at that point?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was accelerating.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about the acceleration?

**Speaker 2:**
I felt great.

**Speaker 1:**
What made it feel great?

**Speaker 2:**
I felt that the increased speed matched my mood at the time. Driving at a normal speed always feels better than going slowly. The acceleration made me feel comfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel when passing through that intersection?

**Speaker 2:**
I did have some feelings about that. The road was quite busy and complex, but when we turned towards the Chinese Academy of Sciences, I noticed there were fewer cars, making it easier to drive. I felt a bit of surprise and joy when we made the turn.

**Speaker 1:**
You were surprised because you thought it would be more congested?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I thought we would continue on the busy road near Tsinghua University, which would have been more complicated. But when we turned, the road conditions improved. I prefer wider roads.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you notice the bicycle that passed by?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't. Throughout the ride, I was observing the surroundings out of instinct, just looking around.
**Speaker 1:**
Throughout the entire process, I was sitting in the car, observing the surroundings on both sides. But I think this observation is just a natural human reaction. I mean, I look around, and if I were driving, I would also check the road conditions on both sides. But did anything leave a deep impression on me? Not really.

**Speaker 2:**
Did you feel anything during the turn?

**Speaker 1:**
No.

**Speaker 2:**
During the first turn, I felt a bit dizzy. When the car returned to the starting point, I still felt a bit dizzy, but it was less intense than at the beginning. So, yes, I did feel a bit dizzy, but it was milder when we returned.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you felt something during the turn?

**Speaker 2:**
No, not really. When we look at the screen, it seems like the angle and the movement are much larger than what I felt inside the car. To me, it felt like a normal turn. The way the car operated was all in service of making that turn, so I didn't feel anything unusual.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel anything when the car was moving?

**Speaker 2:**
No, it felt like a normal drive.

**Speaker 2:**
However, I've never seen such a large screen showing the journey and the road conditions. The environment looked quite beautiful on the screen. But inside the car, you can't really see that. When you look at it on the screen, it looks very scenic.

**Speaker 1:**
What about this place?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't feel anything. Inside the car, the environment is not visible because our view is limited. We can only see what's in front of us, to the left, and to the right. We can't see behind us.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you notice any speed bumps?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but the sensation was very weak. I should have felt something, but it was almost negligible. We can't see them, and as you mentioned, the driver would have a more direct feeling, but we passengers don't feel it as much.

**Speaker 1:**
So, there wasn't a noticeable deceleration?

**Speaker 2:**
Right, it wasn't noticeable.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel when pedestrians were crossing the road?

**Speaker 2:**
Unless it's at a major intersection, if there are pedestrians crossing, I would feel that the car needs to yield to them. The car might stop for a moment. If the car is moving and there are pedestrians on both sides, I would definitely notice that.
**Speaker 1:**
Can you stop for a moment? Maybe, yes. At this time, I would feel that if the car is moving, there might be pedestrians on both sides. I would definitely take a look at my surroundings, but it would just be a quick glance. However, I can't remember much. Even though there are pedestrians, nothing particularly stands out to me. For example, if there was a cyclist who collided with a car, I would remember that immediately.

**Speaker 2:**
The reason I didn't feel anything is because I considered it a normal driving situation. Yes, there was nothing unusual, right? Yes, nothing unusual. Everything happening in that environment seemed normal to me. If you had pointed out something specific for me to pay attention to, I would have noticed it. Yes, definitely.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you didn't notice any pedestrians or the road?

**Speaker 2:**
Right, during that section, when I turned from Chengfu Road, I was actually enjoying the drive. While I was enjoying it, I was more focused on whether I had any negative experiences. My feeling was that I didn't have any. Yes, that's right.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you notice any dangerous or uncomfortable maneuvers by the driver during the drive?

**Speaker 2:**
No, because I was sitting right behind the driver, I could see his back. Plus, his driving skills were quite good, so I didn't feel any danger or discomfort. My classmate in the front might have had a more direct experience. I couldn't see from the back, but...

**Speaker 1:**
And you didn't feel anything either?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't feel anything. My feeling was that I had no feeling, no discomfort. Yes, no discomfort.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think constitutes safe driving behavior?

**Speaker 2:**
I think driving cautiously and carefully is key. Avoid sudden braking and sudden acceleration. As long as you avoid these, especially when turning or reversing, and do everything slowly, it should be very safe. Yes, that's right.

**Speaker 1:**
Are there any other aspects?

**Speaker 2:**
No, nothing else.

**Speaker 1:**
So, when you usually ride in someone else's car, not just in this experiment, are there any behaviors by the driver that make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**
Since I often ride in other people's cars as a passenger, my biggest feeling is that I don't feel secure. As long as the car isn't...
**Speaker 1:**
I often do this when I'm a passenger and someone else is driving. Actually, it doesn't matter whose fault it is; my biggest feeling is that I don't feel secure. As long as I'm not the one driving, I don't feel at ease. After riding in so many people's cars, my biggest impression is that I always feel like others drive too fast. Everyone drives too fast. I always want to point out that they should slow down. That's my most direct feeling. You just feel like they drive too fast, right? Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really. It's just that some drivers have behaviors that make me uncomfortable. When I'm in the car, it's mainly the speed. It makes me worry about safety and affects comfort.

**Speaker 1:**
So, when they drive fast, you feel less comfortable, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, even if the road conditions are good, as long as they drive fast, when they brake or accelerate, it's not as smooth. In today's experiment, the speed wasn't actually that high. I think it was definitely below 80 km/h, but it still felt unstable. If they drive over 120 km/h, the car starts to feel like it's floating. Of course, an SUV is more stable, but if the car doesn't have a strong frame, it feels like it's floating, and you naturally feel less comfortable inside.

**Speaker 1:**
So, how do you think driving can be more comfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
I think, first of all, it's about braking and accelerating smoothly. Also, the driver's mood is important. For example, if I'm driving home after work, my mood at that moment matters. If I'm in a bad or anxious mood, it really affects my driving. If the driver is in a good mood, or at least not upset, and has a neutral attitude—not rushed or irritated—then it's easier to empathize with them. When the driver is in a good mood, they drive more steadily, and as passengers, we won't be as tense and can relax more. I really like that state.

**Speaker 1:**
So, when the driver is in a good mood, they can focus better on the car, the road conditions, and their driving behavior, making the ride smoother, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because road conditions are always changing. For example, the road we just drove on was like this, but if we drive again now, the conditions might be worse. This affects the driver's mood, which in turn affects their driving.
**Speaker 1:**
So, if we were to drive now, the road conditions might be even worse than they are currently. 

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. This can affect the driver's mood, which in turn influences their decisions, such as driving speed, braking, and turning. If the driver becomes agitated, they might drive faster or take turns more abruptly, which would significantly impact the passenger's experience.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you define safety in this context?

**Speaker 2:**
I think safety means not feeling a sense of danger. It’s about being able to relax and sit there without any sense of alertness. That, to me, is safety.

**Speaker 1:**
What conditions make you feel at ease?

**Speaker 2:**
When I don't have to worry too much or be mentally focused all the time.

**Speaker 1:**
And what conditions make you feel uneasy?

**Speaker 2:**
It’s about the immediate experience with the driver. Once the car starts, you can feel the speed and the way the driver handles the vehicle. For example, this afternoon, when the driver took a turn, I felt a bit dizzy. If the driver accelerates too quickly or takes turns too fast, it directly affects my experience and makes me feel uncomfortable. Additionally, if I don't know the driver well, I quickly form an opinion about the overall experience.

**Speaker 1:**
Are there any other factors besides the lack of a sense of danger?

**Speaker 2:**
The environment also plays a role. From the beginning, if I feel that the situation is safe and the experience is pleasant, I won't have any sense of alertness.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you felt that this experiment was safe?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I felt that there was no danger in this experiment.

**Speaker 1:**
In your daily life, if you are riding in a car with an unfamiliar driver, do you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I might feel uneasy. Whether I'm riding with someone I know or not, I might have heard stories or rumors about the driver’s personality. We usually don't ride with strangers without a reason. Even when taking a taxi, the experience is entirely based on how the driver handles the ride. If the driver is aggressive, the experience can be quite unpleasant. So, as you mentioned, it can be either a bad experience or a pleasant one.
**Speaker 1:**
So, you mentioned that the experience was quite terrible. Yes, that's right. As you said, such situations, whether they are bad or pleasant experiences, might only happen once in a lifetime and the environment won't be replicated.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you have a specific definition of comfort? We've talked about comfort, now let's discuss safety.

**Speaker 2:**
When it comes to comfort, I think the hardware is extremely important. The car's performance, its interior design, and the materials used are all crucial. These factors directly affect whether you feel comfortable or uncomfortable while sitting inside. The hardware is very important. Additionally, the driver's skill is also significant. If the driver drives smoothly and steadily, and the car's quality is excellent, your experience will be fantastic, almost heavenly. However, if the hardware is great but the driver's skill is lacking, the experience will still be subpar. Conversely, if the hardware is poor and the driver drives aggressively, the experience will be terrible.

**Speaker 1:**
So, do you focus more on the car's hardware itself, or if you had to choose between the two, which one would you prioritize?

**Speaker 2:**
I think the hardware is very important. The difference between good and bad hardware is quite significant.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you are more concerned about how you feel while sitting inside the car?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's right.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you mean by the car's performance?

**Speaker 2:**
By performance, I mean the overall quality, including the material of the seats and the driving speed. It's a comprehensive concept. The driver's skill can be improved and optimized since it's something that can be controlled by the person.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think makes a driver professional enough? What aspects must they excel in to be considered good and professional?

**Speaker 2:**
A good driver should have a calm and stable mindset. Their driving skills should be proficient and precise. They should know when to brake and when to accelerate without being too aggressive. If they can achieve these, I would consider them a very good driver.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think is the biggest difference between a novice driver and an experienced driver?

**Speaker 2:**
The biggest difference is the maturity of their driving skills. Experienced drivers handle braking, accelerating, decelerating, turning, and driving straight with precision.
**Speaker 1:**  
I feel that experienced drivers have a very good grasp of driving. When you watch them brake, accelerate, decelerate, turn, or go straight, they handle it all very smoothly. But new drivers tend to be more abrupt. They might suddenly accelerate or decelerate sharply, and their braking can be quite harsh.

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, exactly. You could say that new drivers lack control over their speed. Is that what you mean?

**Speaker 1:**  
Yes, that's what I mean. They lack control.

**Speaker 2:**  
Right, right.

**Speaker 1:**  
In your opinion, in what aspects will autonomous driving never be able to match human drivers?

**Speaker 2:**  
Autonomous driving is pre-programmed and can't adapt its overall strategy. For example, if we're driving from here to a large area in Beijing, we can choose to go straight or take a detour. We can decide the best route based on the situation. But autonomous driving can't do that. It can only follow the pre-set route and won't take a detour. So, I think autonomous driving is very rigid.

**Speaker 1:**  
It's quite inflexible.

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, very inflexible. It lacks flexibility.

**Speaker 1:**  
Can you elaborate on this lack of flexibility?

**Speaker 2:**  
Humans are more flexible because we can choose different routes based on the situation. Autonomous driving doesn't have this level of choice. It lacks the ability to adapt to different road conditions.

**Speaker 1:**  
Are there any other thoughts you have on this?

**Speaker 2:**  
Another point is that while autonomous driving systems analyze road conditions and speed quite well, they can't match the accuracy of human judgment. For instance, I can look 100 or 200 meters ahead and adjust my driving accordingly. Autonomous driving systems need to analyze and then decide whether to accelerate or decelerate. This is something they can't do as well as humans.

**Speaker 1:**  
Their reaction time is slower, right? They can't anticipate as well.

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, they can't anticipate road conditions 100 or 200 meters ahead and adjust accordingly.

**Speaker 1:**  
What about their emergency response capabilities?

**Speaker 2:**  
In terms of emergency response, autonomous driving systems are actually quite good.

**Speaker 1:**  
Why do you think that is?

**Speaker 2:**  
I've seen autonomous driving systems in action, and they do have a certain level of...
**Speaker 1:**
How was the driving experience?

**Speaker 2:**
It was pretty good, very responsive in emergencies.

**Speaker 1:**
Why do you think so?

**Speaker 2:**
Because I've seen autonomous driving systems in action. These cars start assessing the situation from a certain distance, say 30 meters or 10 meters away. If they detect a potentially dangerous situation ahead, like heavy traffic or a red light, they begin to slow down automatically. In more dangerous scenarios, they might even come to a complete stop. 

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think in this aspect, autonomous driving is better than human driving?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I believe autonomous systems are more cautious. For instance, a human driver might see a hazard 50 meters away and still decide to drive closer, maybe up to 9 or 8 meters. But an autonomous car would start reacting much earlier and wouldn't take such risks. This is based on what I've observed with autonomous driving.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think our recent trip was driven by a human or an autonomous system?

**Speaker 2:**
It was definitely driven by a human. 

**Speaker 1:**
How can you be sure?

**Speaker 2:**
I was sitting behind the driver and could see him operating the vehicle.

**Speaker 1:**
Besides seeing the driver, were there any other indications that it was a human driving?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the driver was clearly in control the whole time.

**Speaker 1:**
But what if the car was actually an autonomous vehicle and the driver was just a safety operator simulating driving? Would that change your perception?

**Speaker 2:**
No, it wouldn't change my perception. I feel that both autonomous and human driving are quite safe. If it turned out to be an autonomous vehicle, I would actually be excited to have experienced it.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you recall any moment during the trip when you thought the car might not be driven by a human?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, there were moments when I felt it might not be a human driver. For instance, the car consistently alerted us when we reached certain points, which felt very automated.
**Speaker 1:** We completed the entire journey. Although we traveled a long distance, the system would notify us at every checkpoint. It would say, "You've reached this point," or "You are a few hundred meters away from the next point." Every time this happened, I felt it was surreal. Is it automatically designed? Is the car driving itself? Is the driver just a figurehead? So, every time we reached a point, the system would beep or notify us of the distance remaining. It made me wonder if the car was pre-programmed. 

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because of the navigation prompts.

**Speaker 1:** Exactly. And after we finished, someone would come to check if everything was normal. At that moment, I wondered if the entire journey was controlled by instruments. But the driving was real; there was indeed a person driving.

**Speaker 2:** Did you pay special attention to the driver's actions? I couldn't see much from where I was sitting. It was more about the experience and the sensory perception. I saw someone in front of me, driving, wearing a hat and using advanced equipment. So, I felt it was definitely the driver operating the car.

**Speaker 1:** What is your definition of intelligence in terms of autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:** I think it's great. With societal development, intelligence in systems can replace some human roles, allowing people to relax. I find this very beneficial.

**Speaker 1:** How do you define the areas where it can replace human roles?

**Speaker 2:** In simple operations, like automatic cruising in airplanes. Autonomous driving can handle tasks like braking and accelerating, which can be fully automated, eliminating the need for human intervention. I think that's excellent.

**Speaker 1:** Are there any other aspects?

**Speaker 2:** I believe science is incredibly great and remarkable.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, you mentioned its significance. But how do you define this intelligence? And how do you define safety in this context? What aspects do you think cover safety?

**Speaker 2:** I...
**Speaker 1:** We just talked about it. How do you define safety? What aspects do you think can encompass safety? What aspects do we have now?

**Speaker 2:** I think intelligence means it learns by example. People learn by example. Yes, people imitate others. Yes, it imitates people. Yes, exactly, like in cartoons. And also...

**Speaker 1:** Is that all? So, if you were a pedestrian, and you were crossing an intersection without traffic signals, how would you judge the intentions of the drivers of motor vehicles or non-motor vehicles? How would you determine whether they would choose to drive straight, stop, or turn?

**Speaker 2:** By observing, right?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, by observing.

**Speaker 2:** How do you observe? If I were crossing an intersection, I would definitely first observe the environment. My brain would be working at high speed, checking if a vehicle is coming, whether it's a motor vehicle or a non-motor vehicle. I would assess the speed of the vehicle. Is it fast or slow? This helps me judge the safety. Also, I would look at the intersection itself.

**Speaker 1:** What do you judge by the speed?

**Speaker 2:** If the vehicle is fast, and I'm at the roadside, I would consider whether it might come towards me. Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:** What should you look for at the intersection?

**Speaker 2:** The intersection should have traffic lights or signs. If there are no traffic lights, I would rely on my own judgment. If I think the vehicle is fast and it seems unsafe, I would let it pass first. After it passes, I would cross.

**Speaker 1:** Would you choose to rush across regardless of the vehicle's movement, or would you approach slowly, look for an opportunity to cross, or stay put until you are sure there are no cars?

**Speaker 2:** I would definitely stay put until I am sure there are no cars before crossing. That's the last option. Yes, the last option.

**Speaker 1:** Wait until there are no cars at all?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, at least until the vehicle has passed. Once I am sure there are no cars, I would cross when it is completely safe.

**Speaker 1:** How do you feel when a car approaches?

**Speaker 2:** I feel it's a very normal situation. The feeling is very brief for us in the car; it just zooms past. Yes, very brief.

**Speaker 1:** What about the bus?

**Speaker 2:** When the bus passes this place, the biggest feeling is that the traffic is quite busy, and the road conditions are complex. I think if I were driving, I would definitely go slow.

**Speaker 1:** How was your experience during this ride?

**Speaker 2:** My experience was that when passing this intersection, I was thinking to be careful.
**Speaker 1:**
How was your experience during this ride?

**Speaker 2:**
Overall, it was good. When we passed that intersection, I was thinking to be extra careful. Yes, you need to be cautious. I felt that this particular spot was a real test for the driver. Especially during that turn we just made.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel any discomfort or sense of danger?

**Speaker 2:**
No, not really. When we were driving straight or making that turn near the smart courtyard, it felt fine. But honestly, during the turn, my comfort level did drop a bit. I felt a slight sense of anxiety.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it wasn't related to the driver's skills but more to the surroundings?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was related to the environment. Even though I felt this way, I think it's a normal reaction. So, I can overlook that feeling.

**Speaker 2:**
When we returned to that spot, I still felt a bit dizzy. The frequent turns made me feel slightly dizzy, but it doesn't mean I get car sick. It's a minor issue that can be ignored. If a relative or friend drove like this and I said I felt dizzy, it would be an overreaction. It's something that can be easily overlooked.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you usually get car sick?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I don't get car sick. Not getting car sick doesn't mean I don't feel anything. I think everyone feels a bit of discomfort sometimes. If I had to travel back and forth all day, I might feel it too, but generally, I don't get car sick.

**Speaker 1:**
So, that's pretty much it. Do you have any suggestions?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I don't have any suggestions.
