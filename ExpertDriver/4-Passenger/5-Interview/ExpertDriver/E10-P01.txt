**Speaker 1:**
Before we start watching the video, I want to ask you a few simple questions. Do you often travel by car? Is it usually for long or short trips?

**Speaker 2:**
Short trips, generally.

**Speaker 1:**
How long are these trips usually?

**Speaker 2:**
About half an hour or less.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about the ride in our vehicle during this experiment?

**Speaker 2:**
It was quite good.

**Speaker 1:**
How would you rate the driver's skills?

**Speaker 2:**
Pretty good.

**Speaker 1:**
If you had a choice, what type of car would you prefer for traveling?

**Speaker 2:**
A sedan would be fine.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you have a preference between gasoline and electric cars?

**Speaker 2:**
No specific preference.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you drive yourself?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I don't drive.

**Speaker 1:**
Next, I'll play the video we just recorded. If you notice any moments where your experience changes, please let me know. I'll pause at specific points to ask for your feedback.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel when the car started moving?

**Speaker 2:**
It felt normal, not too fast or too slow. The speed didn't affect my experience.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about the turns the driver made?

**Speaker 2:**
The turns were smooth and steady, with controlled speed.

**Speaker 1:**
How did the driver handle the right turn? Did you feel safe?

**Speaker 2:**
It was handled normally, and I didn't feel concerned about safety.

**Speaker 1:**
At one point, you pressed a button. What was that about?

**Speaker 2:**
The navigation system was too loud, and it annoyed me, so I pressed the button to mute it.

**Speaker 1:**
Was this related to the driver's skills?

**Speaker 2:**
No, it wasn't.

**Speaker 1:**
You pressed the button again later. Why was that?

**Speaker 2:**
It was because the sun was too bright.

**Speaker 1:**
Overall, how did you feel about the driver's assistance?

**Speaker 2:**
It was fine, quite normal.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you have any safety concerns?

**Speaker 2:**
No, the slow speed didn't make me worry.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about the lane changes?

**Speaker 2:**
There was no danger; it felt fine.

**Speaker 1:**
What about the U-turn? Did you have any concerns?

**Speaker 2:**
I think I pressed the button again because of the glare from the sun.
**Speaker 1:**  
Did you feel any danger? How did you feel?

**Speaker 2:**  
It seemed like there were some flashes. I remember pressing the button because either the sky was flashing frequently or there was a direct, intense flash.

**Speaker 1:**  
So, during this part of the drive, you didn't feel anything unusual?

**Speaker 2:**  
No, it felt quite comfortable.

**Speaker 1:**  
You mentioned you fell asleep for a few minutes in the car.

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, it was quite comfortable at that stage. If there had been a traffic jam, I wouldn't have been able to sleep. But since there wasn't, it was smooth sailing.

**Speaker 1:**  
Did you notice anything at the intersection?

**Speaker 2:**  
No, there weren't many cars, so there was nothing to worry about.

**Speaker 1:**  
And the turns didn't cause any discomfort?

**Speaker 2:**  
It depends on the traffic. If there aren't many cars, it feels fine.

**Speaker 1:**  
How did you feel when the car went over speed bumps? Did the driver handle it smoothly? Did the driver do anything that made you uncomfortable, especially in terms of driving?

**Speaker 2:**  
The driver handled the bumps and obstacles like manhole covers well. Everything was within an acceptable range. The driver seemed to slow down intentionally to make the ride more comfortable.

**Speaker 1:**  
So, overall, the driver's handling of speed and safety didn't cause you any concern?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, I didn't worry at all. The driver didn't force pedestrians or other vehicles to yield. The road conditions created a relatively safe environment.

**Speaker 2:**  
The ride was stable, and I felt confident in the driver's abilities. I had no issues.

**Speaker 1:**  
So, you trusted the driver today?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, I did. During the drive, I didn't focus on the driver but rather on the road conditions and scenery because I felt at ease.

**Speaker 1:**  
You can share anything else you'd like to mention.

**Speaker 2:**  
When I take a taxi, I usually pay close attention to the driver to ensure safety. I'm always cautious, especially if the driver behaves suspiciously. For instance, if the driver doesn't check both sides before moving, it raises concerns.
**Speaker 1:**
So, you were concerned that he might be a bad person?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I was quite focused on him. There was another specific behavior, for example, he would signal a turn but not check both sides. If I were sitting in the second row, I could clearly see him not looking to the right. I would think he was making some extra, unnecessary movements. From a purely driving safety perspective, my first impression would be to judge based on our course. So, I would determine if he could drive properly.

**Speaker 1:**
What characteristics do you mainly observe?

**Speaker 2:**
I don't mean to be sexist, but I tend to trust male drivers more. For male drivers, I feel more confident. For female drivers, especially older ones, they often have certain professional traits, like wearing gloves or a cap. I feel more at ease with such women, thinking they are experienced drivers. For very young female drivers, I might have some doubts, but not too many.

**Speaker 1:**
Does your judgment of the driver affect your perception of their driving skills?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it does. If a driver can handle normal driving without sudden braking, I think they are decent. If they frequently brake hard, I consider them a poor driver.

**Speaker 1:**
Did today's driver have any sudden braking or abrupt stops?

**Speaker 2:**
No, everything was quite smooth. He didn't make any sudden moves or abrupt lane changes.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you are sensitive to the driving environment?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I am. This driver accelerated smoothly.

**Speaker 1:**
Smooth acceleration?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, he didn't suddenly speed up or accelerate too much.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it was a normal acceleration. Do you think today's driving experience was different from your usual ones?

**Speaker 2:**
Maybe it's because of the experiment. The driver seemed more cautious.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you usually encounter drivers who make abrupt movements?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, compared to today's driver, they are usually more abrupt.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think driving slowly is good or bad?

**Speaker 2:**
It depends. If I'm in a hurry, I wouldn't like it. But if I'm not in a rush, it's fine.
**Speaker 1:**
Do you think it's good or bad that he drives slowly?

**Speaker 2:**
If I have something urgent, then it's not good. But if I'm not in a hurry, it's fine.

**Speaker 1:**
So, in terms of your experience, does his slow driving affect your comfort?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it does.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you feel safe, but the comfort is compromised because it's too slow?

**Speaker 2:**
At first, it was okay, but as traffic increased, it became less comfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
I see. So, you can accept it. How do you think driving can be made safer? Did the driver do anything dangerous today?

**Speaker 2:**
No, he didn't do anything dangerous.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think makes driving safer?

**Speaker 2:**
Let me think.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, what makes driving safer?

**Speaker 2:**
It's hard to say exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you give some examples? What actions by the driver make you feel safe?

**Speaker 2:**
For example, when there are many cars, he doesn't brake suddenly.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
He doesn't drive too close to the edge of the road.

**Speaker 1:**
So, he keeps a safe distance from the road's edge. From your description, it seems you observe the driver closely. Do you think the driver's emotional state affects safety?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, if he looks tired, I get worried.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you would be concerned if he seemed tired?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I would be a bit worried.

**Speaker 1:**
When you ride in other people's cars, like in a ride-share, what behaviors make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**
If the driver is tired or angry, it makes me uneasy. If he just had an argument, I would be concerned.

**Speaker 1:**
What specific behaviors make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**
As I mentioned, sudden braking and not paying attention to driving.

**Speaker 1:**
Did this driver do anything that made you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
No, it was more about the environment.

**Speaker 1:**
What kind of driving makes you feel more comfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Driving steadily.

**Speaker 1:**
How did today's driver perform in that regard?

**Speaker 2:**
He was quite steady.
**Speaker 1:** Driving can make you feel more comfortable.

**Speaker 2:** How to drive? Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:** Today, the driver was quite steady.

**Speaker 2:** Yes.

**Speaker 1:** This steadiness is reflected in the speed.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, and also in the way he starts the car.

**Speaker 1:** Right. Are there any other influencing factors?

**Speaker 2:** You know, those behaviors I worry about when getting into a car.

**Speaker 1:** So, it's a psychological input, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:** When you usually ride in someone else's car, what behaviors from the driver make you feel uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** The driver...

**Speaker 1:** Playing music, and in terms of road driving?

**Speaker 2:** Nothing strange, just no sudden braking.

**Speaker 1:** So, generally, behaviors that make you feel unsafe also make you feel uncomfortable, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes.

**Speaker 1:** What do you think makes a good or professional driver?

**Speaker 2:** Emotional stability and steady driving. Also, the environment inside the car should match.

**Speaker 1:** How does that manifest?

**Speaker 2:** If the car's interior is good, like it’s clean and has no bad odors, it reflects well on the driver. I would feel more comfortable.

**Speaker 1:** I see. Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** If the car's environment is bad, I feel the driver might be sloppy, and it makes me think they might drive sloppily too.

**Speaker 1:** So, the car's interior affects your judgment of the driver's skill level?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, a bit. If the car is in poor condition, I might think the driver is strange.

**Speaker 1:** What do you think is the biggest difference between an experienced driver and a novice driver?

**Speaker 2:** It's in situations like turning, traffic jams, or starting the car. Experienced drivers handle unexpected situations more quickly and flexibly.

**Speaker 1:** Experienced drivers are more adaptable to sudden situations.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, they can anticipate and react to movements better.

**Speaker 1:** Have you ever learned about autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I have.

**Speaker 1:** Have you ever experienced it?

**Speaker 2:** Let me think... No, I haven't.

**Speaker 1:** Based on your understanding of autonomous driving, what aspects do you think it can never match human drivers?

**Speaker 2:** It can't drive as gently as a human.

**Speaker 1:** You mean autonomous driving can't drive as smoothly as a human?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because I've seen some test videos from the U.S. I don't know which company, but they have already launched it in the market. From the videos, the driving seemed very rigid, especially during turns.
**Speaker 1:** I don't know which company it is, but they've already launched it in the market. When I watched the video, I felt the driving was very stiff, especially when turning. It would suddenly make a turn, which felt a bit strange and scary because it couldn't handle the finer details well.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it can't take care of the finer details like a human can.

**Speaker 1:** What other aspects concern you?

**Speaker 2:** I'm not sure. I feel that road conditions are very complex. I'm not certain if it can accurately judge the road conditions. It's not just about cars; there are many electric vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians, especially on small roads.

**Speaker 1:** Like side roads, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, not the main roads, but those small roads. I'm not sure if it can handle them.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think the recent trip was driven by a driver or by an autonomous system?

**Speaker 2:** I think autonomous driving should be able to handle it.

**Speaker 1:** You think autonomous driving can handle it?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because the road wasn't that difficult.

**Speaker 1:** So, do you think it was the driver or the autonomous system driving?

**Speaker 2:** It could be either.

**Speaker 1:** So, it could be both, right? What details made you feel it might be autonomous driving? How was it different from your usual experience?

**Speaker 2:** If I had to say, it felt like very high-tech autonomous driving.

**Speaker 1:** If it was autonomous driving, it must be very high-tech, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because it drove very smoothly.

**Speaker 1:** So, because it drove smoothly, you think it might be high-tech autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because it was so smooth, I believe it was high-tech autonomous driving.

**Speaker 1:** So, the difference from your usual experience is that it was very smooth, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes.

**Speaker 1:** When you are a pedestrian and you need to cross a road without traffic lights, how do you judge the intentions of the oncoming vehicles?

**Speaker 2:** If it's a car, I look at its lights.

**Speaker 1:** The signal lights, right? You look at the car's signals.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I think there are three main indicators: the lights, the distance between the car and you, and if the car slows down a bit, it means the driver is letting you pass. Also, sometimes pedestrians inside the car might wave to let you know you can cross.

**Speaker 1:** So, you look at the driver's gestures, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, but this method isn't very reliable. The most common scenario is that the car will try to pass first.

**Speaker 1:** So, how do you usually cross in such situations?
**Speaker 1:**
In situations where there are no traffic lights, how do you usually navigate through an intersection? What do you typically do?

**Speaker 2:**
I usually observe the speed of the other vehicles.

**Speaker 1:**
So, if another driver slows down to let you pass, what do you do?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, if they slow down or stop, I will proceed.

**Speaker 1:**
What if there are many cars? Do you move forward slowly or wait until there are no cars?

**Speaker 2:**
If there are many cars, I will move forward slowly. If there are too many cars, I might wait until the traffic clears up a bit.

**Speaker 1:**
So, if the road is busy with many cars, do you inch forward or wait until it's clear?

**Speaker 2:**
If there are many people around, I will inch forward slowly. If there aren't many people, I will proceed more confidently.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you assess the situation based on the number of people and cars around you, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. I look at the number of people and cars around me.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, I think we've covered all the questions for today. Thank you very much for participating in our experiment.
