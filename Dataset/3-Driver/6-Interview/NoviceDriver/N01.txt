**Transcript:**

**Speaker 1:**
Testing the microphone, Feihe, microphone.

**Speaker 2:**
It's a pair.

**Speaker 1:**
Didn't you check it yesterday? Think about it.

**Speaker 1:**
You tidy up first.

**Speaker 2:**
And then?

**Speaker 1:**
I'll pull up some data.

**Speaker 2:**
Okay, you ask first, and I'll get going.

**Speaker 2:**
Alright, I'll go to the store.

**Speaker 1:**
Oh, can you come up?

**Speaker 2:**
There's enough time.

**Speaker 1:**
Is there an access control?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you get in? No. The 11th floor and the 11th-floor market. Yes, you can get there from here.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you check the surveillance for me to see what triggered it? It triggered at 15:03 and 16:26. The initial trigger, not the other one. Because the panoramic view doesn't have the other one. What did it come from?

**Speaker 2:**
You mean he was in the car.

**Speaker 1:**
Not in a small car.

**Speaker 2:**
It's unlikely to be this import. Hmm, then the general surveillance import shared data.

**Speaker 1:**
Which ones are we talking about? Which three meetings?

**Speaker 1:**
I took it from the back of the second meeting. Not stole, I don't know, but it should be me. I personally think it's me.

**Speaker 2:**
The surveillance start time is 15:00, and then periodically every twenty-something.

**Speaker 1:**
Seconds, and at this time, it's 5 minutes and twenty-something seconds.

**Speaker 2:**
Basically, it's correct, not someone you care about.

**Speaker 1:**
Then you just look at the surveillance. Okay.

**Speaker 2:**
Look at 25 and a half.

**Speaker 1:**
Just like that, 5 minutes and 20 seconds, then. What is 5 minutes and 20 seconds? It's the demo here, corresponding to the surveillance time of 15:38, 15:38. 15:38 is. Can you help me with 5:38:25?

**Speaker 2:**
It's 5 minutes, just right.

**Speaker 1:**
Then the beginning is exactly 19:33.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, got it. Okay, understood.

**Speaker 2:**

Speaker 1:
So, you've driven sedans, SUVs, and MPVs?

Speaker 2:
Yes, including those 7-seater business vans.

Speaker 1:
And you've also driven large vehicles, like military trucks?

Speaker 2:
Yes, in the military, I drove those big trucks.

Speaker 1:
What kind of driver's license do you have?

Speaker 2:
I have a Class C license for regular vehicles and a Class B license for military vehicles.

Speaker 1:
Got it. Have you ever driven a car with advanced driver-assistance features?

Speaker 2:
No, I haven't driven one with those features.

Speaker 1:
Like adaptive cruise control?

Speaker 2:
I've used cruise control on the highway, setting it to 100 or 120 km/h.

Speaker 1:
What kind of car was that?

Speaker 2:
It was a Buick SUV.

Speaker 1:
Besides cruise control, have you used any other features?

Speaker 2:
Does automatic start-stop count?

Speaker 1:
You mean the feature that stops and starts the engine at traffic lights?

Speaker 2:
Yes, that counts. Other than that, I haven't used any other advanced features. I haven't driven a Tesla, for example.

Speaker 1:
Have you driven an electric car?

Speaker 2:
Yes, a couple of times.

Speaker 1:
A fully electric one? How did you find it?

Speaker 2:
The acceleration was very quick, and it was very quiet. The car felt light overall.

Speaker 1:
Light in terms of the car's weight and the steering?

Speaker 2:
Yes, the car felt light, and the steering was also light.

Speaker 1:
Do you usually drive long distances or short distances in the city?

Speaker 2:
In the city, I usually drive around 40 kilometers each time.

Speaker 1:
How long does it take to drive 40 kilometers?

Speaker 2:
About an hour.

Speaker 1:
How did you find driving our car this time?

Speaker 2:
This car is good, but the acceleration feels a bit slow.

Speaker 1:
You mean the throttle response is slow?

Speaker 2:
Yes, it might be because it's a hybrid. The acceleration feels slow unless you press the pedal all the way down. When it's running on electric power, it's quite comfortable and easy to handle. When you press the pedal fully, it switches to gasoline, and the power is sufficient.

Speaker 1:
How about the brakes?

Speaker 2:
The brakes feel normal, just fine.

Speaker 1:
Even though you're a regular driver, I'm curious about your driving experience in the military. Have you ever transported important cargo or personnel?
Person 1:
Although you might be an ordinary driver, I still want to ask you about some of your driving experiences in the military. For example, have you ever driven important figures like leaders or officers?

Person 2:
No, I haven't done that.

Person 1:
So, what kind of vehicles did you mainly drive?

Person 2:
I drove special vehicles for about three months, mainly for practice.

Person 1:
You practiced driving those vehicles?

Person 2:
Yes, I practiced to get my license. After that, I didn't drive those large trucks anymore.

Person 1:
Alright, let's take a look at this video. I'll show you how it provides a 360-degree view of the surroundings. You can see everything around you. Now, you've just started driving. Could you help me calculate the search time? While we're in the parking lot, I can ask you some other questions. Later, when we're on the road, I'll ask you about specific situations like turning, merging, and driving straight. I'll ask why you make certain decisions and about your usual driving habits. Can you describe your usual habits when making a turn?

Person 2:
When I'm turning, I usually check the right mirror first if I'm turning right. If there are no pedestrians or vehicles, I proceed.

Person 1:
So, you check the right mirror to see if there are any pedestrians or vehicles, and if it's clear, you proceed?

Person 2:
Yes, I check the right mirror. If there are no pedestrians or vehicles, I proceed.

Person 1:
Do you also check the left side?

Person 2:
When turning right, I usually don't check the left side.

Person 1:
Why is that?

Person 2:
I might glance at it occasionally, but not often.

Person 1:
So, you glance at the left side to see if there are any vehicles, and if it's clear, you proceed with the right turn?

Person 2:
Yes, I mainly focus on the right side.

Person 1:
Are you referring to turning right at a green light or a red light? Because if it's a red light, you can turn right without waiting for the light to change. But you still need to check for oncoming traffic from the left, which has the green light.

Person 2:
Yes, exactly. While checking the right side, I also need to be aware of any oncoming traffic from the left.

Person 1:
Alright, we'll look at a turning scenario later. Do you have a specific sequence for checking? For example, do you check one side first and then the other?

Person 2:
I usually check the left side first.

Person 1:
So, you check the left side first, then the right side?

Person 2:
Yes, I glance at the left side quickly, but I pay more attention to the right side because there might be sudden pedestrians or vehicles.

Person 1:
What about when you're turning left?

Person 2:
When turning left, I do the opposite.

Person 1:
So, you check the left side first, then the right side?
Speaker 1: Sometimes people or other obstacles might suddenly appear, so I often check the right side.

Speaker 2: When making a left turn, it's the opposite.

Speaker 1: So, when you approach, you first look to the left, then to the right, then left again, and finally right again. Do you feel more pressure when making a left turn or a right turn? 

Speaker 2: Personally, I feel more pressure when making a left turn. Maybe because the right side feels a bit farther away.

Speaker 1: Is it a personal habit? For example, are you right-handed?

Speaker 2: Yes, I'm right-handed. I find right turns easier and more comfortable because of my habit.

Speaker 1: So, you steer with your right hand and feel it's easier that way?

Speaker 2: Yes, I feel more in control with my right hand.

Speaker 1: But when you use your left hand, you feel less in control?

Speaker 2: Exactly. I'm used to steering with my right hand. For left turns, I sometimes have to adjust my grip.

Speaker 1: In the first experiment on the road, there were fewer cars at the turn. But one car blocked your lane.

Speaker 2: Yes, it blocked my lane.

Speaker 1: So, you had to move to the left lane, which caused a potential conflict with other vehicles. Did you let them pass first?

Speaker 2: Yes, I let them pass.

Speaker 1: Were you worried that the electric bike might speed up and cut in front of you?

Speaker 2: No, I wasn't worried because I saw it and knew it wouldn't.

Speaker 1: How did you know?

Speaker 2: I saw it slowing down and it eventually went behind me.

Speaker 1: So, it passed behind your car?

Speaker 2: Yes, it was moving slowly and had already decelerated.

Speaker 1: I understand. Let's continue. If you see any place where you felt it was dangerous or you took specific actions to avoid a collision, let me know, and we can pause.

Speaker 2: Sure.

Speaker 1: Did you feel it was far enough away?

Speaker 2: Yes, it wasn't a significant danger.

Speaker 1: Even with non-motorized vehicles?
Sure, here is the translated and refined conversation in English:

---

Speaker 1:
Do you think he was quite far from you?

Speaker 2:
Yes, that's a bit of a danger point.

Speaker 1:
In situations like this, where there are non-motorized vehicles and their lane is occupied by cars, they might encroach into your lane. How do you usually handle this?

Speaker 2:
I usually try to anticipate their movements.

Speaker 1:
Do you move closer to the left side to avoid them?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I tend to move a bit to the left. But if they stay within their lane, there won't be much change in my driving.

Speaker 1:
Can you describe the view you had when you were about to enter the main road?

Speaker 2:
I checked the left rearview mirror and saw no cars behind, so I accelerated immediately.

Speaker 1:
You mean you checked here?

Speaker 2:
Yes, there was only one car behind me, and it was quite far away.

Speaker 1:
Could you see beyond the green belt?

Speaker 2:
At that point, I could see a bit beyond it.

Speaker 1:
But as you moved forward, you couldn't see anymore?

Speaker 2:
Yes, if I moved forward, I couldn't see. If I moved backward, I would rely on my peripheral vision.

Speaker 1:
Relying on peripheral vision might not be enough to see clearly.

Speaker 2:
Yes, peripheral vision might not be sufficient to judge.

Speaker 1:
At least, at that moment, there were no cars close to you. I noticed you moved forward quite a bit before changing lanes.

Speaker 2:
Sudden lane changes can be very dangerous. It's better to move forward a bit to ensure there's enough distance.

Speaker 1:
Then you moved to the far left lane?

Speaker 2:
Yes, because I needed to make a U-turn soon after.

Speaker 1:
Is this your usual habit when changing lanes?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I follow my usual driving habits.

Speaker 1:
Today, the buffer zone for lane changes was quite poor. On some ring roads, the buffer zones are very small.

Speaker 2:
Yes, after the new speed limits, I usually take a quick look. But normally...

Speaker 1:
Normally, do you wait longer?

Speaker 2:
If there are always cars, I move forward bit by bit.

Speaker 1:
You mean you slowly move the car forward so others can see you?

Speaker 2:
Yes, if you suddenly appear, it can be dangerous. But if you don't move at all, you can't see behind either. So, moving forward bit by bit is safer.

Speaker 1:
After entering the main road, do you quickly accelerate to match the traffic flow?

---

This translation and refinement should make the conversation more fluent and reasonable.
Speaker 1:
When you can't see behind you, you move forward little by little to get into position, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, after merging onto the main road, you need to quickly accelerate to match the speed of other cars. Otherwise, you'll hold up the traffic behind you. It's best to speed up after changing lanes.

Speaker 1:
This section of the road is good for straight-line acceleration. The speed limit here is 60 km/h. What speed were you driving at?

Speaker 2:
I remember the fastest I went was 65 km/h.

Speaker 1:
On this road? It should be.

Speaker 2:
Yes, the fastest was 65 km/h.

Speaker 1:
So you didn't exceed the speed limit of 60 km/h?

Speaker 2:
No, I didn't exceed it.

Speaker 1:
On straight roads with good conditions, how fast do you usually drive? For example, on a specific section of the Fourth Ring Road in Beijing, where the speed limit is 80 km/h.

Speaker 2:
Yes, the limit is 80 km/h. During the day, I usually drive around 70 km/h, but I stay within the speed limit.

Speaker 1:
And at night?

Speaker 2:
At night, I might exceed the speed limit a bit since there are fewer cars. I might go up to 90 km/h.

Speaker 1:
Would you go up to 100 km/h?

Speaker 2:
No, I stay within 20% of the speed limit. If I exceed 100 km/h, there are cameras that will catch me.

Speaker 1:
So you don't go over 100 km/h, just around 90 km/h?

Speaker 2:
Yes, around 90 km/h.

Speaker 1:
What is your usual following distance? You can talk about both highways and city roads.

Speaker 2:
On highways, I keep a bit more distance.

Speaker 1:
For example, on a highway with a 100 km/h speed limit, what is your following distance?

Speaker 2:
About 20 meters. I don't have a precise measurement, but I keep a safe distance.

Speaker 1:
So, roughly one car length, which is about 5 meters?

Speaker 2:
Yes, about 5 meters. On highways, I keep a distance of about 20 meters.

Speaker 1:
Are you sure about the 20 meters on a highway with a 120 km/h speed limit?

Speaker 2:
Yes, around 20 meters. The highway markers help me gauge the distance.

Speaker 1:
So, on such roads, you keep within 50 meters?

Speaker 2:
Yes, within 50 meters.

Speaker 1:
And on city roads?

Speaker 2:
On city roads, I might follow a bit closer, around 5 meters.

Speaker 1:
So, about one car length?

Speaker 2:
Yes, about one car length.
**Speaker 1:**
So, it's about 5 meters, maybe just enough to move the car sideways. Approximately that distance, right? Yes, that's about right. Okay, this is a U-turn here.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's right.

**Speaker 1:**
I noticed that before you make a U-turn, you tend to steer to the right first to create more space on the left.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that way I can make the turn in one go.

**Speaker 1:**
Is this something you learned from experience, or did someone teach you this?

**Speaker 2:**
It's a bit of both. I think it's more common sense, but experience helps too.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you judge the distance between your car and the one on your right in such situations?

**Speaker 2:**
I rely on my instincts.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you use any reference points, like a taxi or something?

**Speaker 2:**
Let me think... Yes, sometimes I use reference points.

**Speaker 1:**
Today was actually your first time driving our car, right? But you handled it quite well. For example, when your right tire was just on the white line, you didn't cross it. How do you control that distance?

**Speaker 2:**
It's all about feeling.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you don't deliberately look for a specific reference point?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I don't. I never look for specific points when driving or parking.

**Speaker 1:**
What is your usual habit when making a U-turn?

**Speaker 2:**
I usually make sure the front of the car is in the lane closest to me if it's clear, then I proceed.

**Speaker 1:**
I noticed that even though there were cars on the road, you didn't wait for them. You just moved the front of your car into the lane if it was clear.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, if I waited for them, it would take longer. If a car is already close, I would let it pass, but if it's just turning, I go ahead.

**Speaker 1:**
I heard from others that you made the U-turn in one go. How did you judge that you could make it? Most drivers usually have to adjust a bit, especially the first time they try it.

**Speaker 2:**
The first time I tried, I had to adjust because the turning radius was a bit small. The second time, I knew to steer a bit more to the right to make it in one go.

**Speaker 1:**
So, steering a bit more to the right helps?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly.
Speaker 1: The turning radius was a bit small, so I had to reverse once. The second time, I had to steer a bit more to the right.

Speaker 2: Yes, just a bit to the right, and you can make it.

Speaker 1: And I knew I wouldn't hit anyone. Yes, I knew.

Speaker 2: Alright, this part wasn't too difficult.

Speaker 1: Right.

Speaker 2: It's a common situation. Have you ever overtaken another vehicle on the road? Can you recall any instances?

Speaker 1: Yes, are you asking about this trip?

Speaker 2: No, I mean during this entire drive, did you overtake any vehicles?

Speaker 1: Yes, there was one instance during this drive.

Speaker 2: Okay, if you remember the details of the overtaking, please tell me. It was in that section with the figure-eight pattern, right?

Speaker 1: Yes, it was in the figure-eight section, just as we entered it.

Speaker 2: Was there a car blocking you? Was it stopped or just moving very slowly, so you passed it on the left?

Speaker 1: Yes, exactly. It was moving very slowly, so I passed it on the left. Here, we also had a right turn. You need to be aware of the road conditions.

Speaker 2: At that time, I couldn't see very clearly.

Speaker 1: Especially from the right side, the visibility wasn't as good as on the left.

Speaker 2: Yes, it was hard to see clearly.

Speaker 1: You couldn't see it in the rearview mirror, right?

Speaker 2: No, I had to turn my head to look through the window.

Speaker 1: Did the experimental equipment affect your ability to observe the road?

Speaker 2: My glasses were a bit uncomfortable, but I adjusted them later.

Speaker 1: But there were fewer cars, so you could pass directly.

Speaker 2: Yes, and there was a right turn ahead. The road conditions were good today.

Speaker 1: Yes, if there were more cars, the experiment might have more reference value.

Speaker 2: It's hard to say. If there were too many cars, it would just be a traffic jam, and you wouldn't need to observe much.

Speaker 1: Did you have to wait long here?

Speaker 2: No, it was manageable.

Speaker 1: How did you judge whether the non-motorized vehicle would cross in front of you or wait for you to pass?

Speaker 2: It would wait because there was already one car ahead of me, and it saw the second car coming.

Speaker 1: But there was quite a distance between you two.

Speaker 2: Yes, but I didn't think it would cross because its foot was already on the ground, so it would wait.

Speaker 1: I understand. If its foot was on the ground, it couldn't accelerate quickly.

Speaker 2: Exactly, if it wanted to rush, it would have.
Speaker 1:
I understand what you mean. He didn't have his foot on the ground, which means he couldn't accelerate quickly.

Speaker 2:
If he wanted to rush, he would have already prepared for it.

Speaker 1:
So, you noticed him early on and figured he wouldn't rush towards you. Right, no problem.

Speaker 2:
Yes, that's correct. You mean overtaking? Yes, I think so. I forgot, but it should be this car.

Speaker 1:
There was a bicycle going against traffic, and you saw it. You thought it would pass the truck and then merge in, right? So, you felt it wouldn't collide with you? Yes, it wouldn't. But weren't you worried that the cyclist might suddenly swerve?

Speaker 2:
It was still quite far from me, and I...

Speaker 1:
You were already on the left side of the lane, giving him enough space. Also, there was a large vehicle, so you couldn't see if someone might suddenly cross the road. In such situations, do you slow down and observe?

Speaker 2:
I might not slow down, but I would anticipate and think about it in advance. It's called "ghost head," always considering this possibility and being prepared. But I wouldn't deliberately slow down.

Speaker 1:
So, if someone suddenly rushed out...

Speaker 2:
It was still quite far. Yes, it was far, and they wouldn't directly enter this lane. They would stay in the bicycle lane.

Speaker 1:
Mainly because this road was closed. Otherwise, they might have come directly.

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly.

Speaker 1:
There are many such vehicles here. You were already in the middle of the lane.

Speaker 2:
I was planning to overtake him.

Speaker 1:
You wanted to overtake him?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I wanted to overtake him. I would have overtaken him soon. At that time...

Speaker 1:
But you waited for the electric bike to pass before overtaking, right?

Speaker 2:
No, I was watching the oncoming traffic and moved the car slightly to see better. This way, I could see the oncoming vehicles.

Speaker 1:
So, you usually move half of your car out to check for oncoming traffic before overtaking?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I always move half of the car out to observe.

Speaker 1:
Otherwise, you can't see clearly from here. If you suddenly swerved...

Speaker 2:
And if there was an oncoming vehicle...

Speaker 1:
You would be fully responsible.
Speaker 1:
First, you need to check for oncoming traffic. Otherwise, you won't be able to see it from here, right?

Speaker 2:
If I suddenly turn without checking, and there's a car coming from the opposite direction...

Speaker 1:
You'd be fully responsible.

Speaker 2:
Exactly, that would be very serious. For safety, I first checked, and there were no cars coming.

Speaker 1:
No cars. Did you honk your horn?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I did. I honked before overtaking.

Speaker 1:
So, you prefer using the horn to signal other drivers about your intentions?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I think it's important to use the horn to alert them.

Speaker 1:
Do you prefer using the horn or lights?

Speaker 2:
During the day, I prefer using the horn.

Speaker 1:
And at night?

Speaker 2:
I might use the high beams more at night, just a quick flash. But generally, I don't like using the high beams too much because it can be annoying to others.

Speaker 1:
There's a school here.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I see it. I'll slow down and make a left turn.

Speaker 1:
The other driver was going straight and then turned right. How did you judge that?

Speaker 2:
He was turning, but he might have been going straight initially. 

Speaker 1:
Yes, he didn't turn immediately, so he might have blocked your path a bit. But he eventually let you pass, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, he did.

Speaker 1:
You were driving quite fast on this road.

Speaker 2:
There were no cars, so it was safe.

Speaker 1:
There are usually more cars on this road, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, normally there are more cars. I think I overtook another car here as well.

Speaker 1:
Yes, I remember you overtook a car that was moving very slowly. Did you see it from a distance or only when you got closer?

Speaker 2:
I saw it from a distance.

Speaker 1:
You had to move to the left lane to overtake, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I did.

Speaker 1:
This is a right turn, and this intersection is quite important because it's a four-way intersection without traffic lights. But today, there were fewer cars, so it was easier.

Speaker 2:
Yes, that's right.

Speaker 1:
Why did you start turning right so early?

Speaker 2:
I wanted to make sure I had enough time to safely complete the turn.
Speaker 1: Yes, but today there were fewer cars, so there was nothing to distract you.

Speaker 2: Right.

Speaker 1: Why did you start turning right so early?

Speaker 2: Because we needed to get to the right side soon.

Speaker 1: Yes, but you might have already crossed the white line here.

Speaker 2: It was a solid line, but I don't think I crossed it. I was close, but I didn't go over it.

Speaker 1: You were just touching it. Yes, close but not over.

Speaker 2: Yes, and since there weren't many cars, I felt it was okay.

Speaker 1: At this point, I couldn't see what was ahead.

Speaker 2: I remember the light was red because the cars on the opposite side weren't moving.

Speaker 1: Did you change lanes?

Speaker 2: No, I didn't.

Speaker 1: I noticed that during your first test drive and the second official drive, you always moved to the middle lane instead of the rightmost lane. Is that a personal habit?

Speaker 2: If there are cars on the opposite side...

Speaker 1: Yes, if there are cars coming from the other side, you can't directly turn into the middle lane.

Speaker 2: I would turn into the first lane if there were no cars, but if there were, I would make a wider turn for the comfort of the passengers.

Speaker 1: So, for passenger comfort, you make a wider turn because it’s less sharp, reducing the centrifugal force and allowing for a smoother steering angle.

Speaker 2: Exactly, it's more comfortable. A wider turn might be around 15 degrees.

Speaker 1: Understood.

Speaker 1: On this road, many drivers have taken the wrong turn during tests. How did you determine where to turn right? Even with navigation, it can be confusing with multiple waypoints.

Speaker 2: The navigation was constantly talking, but if it says 100 meters, you know it's not the immediate turn.

Speaker 1: So, you rely on the distance mentioned by the navigation to make your decision.

Speaker 2: Yes, especially since there are many similar intersections. You have to pay attention to the distance mentioned by the navigation.

Speaker 1: Were you worried about the car in front of you changing lanes?

Speaker 2: No, it was moving very slowly.

Speaker 1: It didn't seem like it was changing lanes. Do you get nervous in such situations, like when there's a bus in front and another one nearby?

Speaker 2: Buses usually start very slowly after closing their doors. Both buses were moving slowly, so I wasn't worried.
Speaker 1:
So, after closing the door, how do you start? Usually, the start is very slow. Both cars are the same; you first turn the head a bit. You have this tendency, but at this moment, neither of these two cars is there. For example, this bicycle is moving in a straight line. As long as I move slightly to the left...

Speaker 2:
OK. And usually, on some roads, after people get off here, they might cross the road. They walk around the front of the bus and come to you, and you can't see them.

Speaker 1:
Yes, this situation is rare for me. I know, but I rarely encounter people walking around the front of the bus.

Speaker 2:
I understand, but in this case, the person is already in front of you.

Speaker 1:
So, I remember to move slightly to the left.

Speaker 2:
Yes, you should be on the line. We... Oh no.

Speaker 1:
Is it that when the car and road conditions are good, you might use the brakes less when turning?

Speaker 2:
Yes, you don't need to use the brakes much. Basically, you don't need to use the brakes.

Speaker 1:
It feels like every driver has their own habits.

Speaker 2:
No, sometimes I might even accelerate while turning to make the turn faster and exit the turn quicker.

Speaker 1:
Is the reason for slowing down here because of that?

Speaker 2:
The reason for slowing down here is because...

Speaker 1:
The vehicle in front?

Speaker 2:
The bicycle. No, no, the white car in front.

Speaker 1:
This white car?

Speaker 2:
Wait a moment, it should be... 

Speaker 1:
Going back.

Speaker 2:
Move forward a bit. Yes, this white car, it will block because...

Speaker 1:
It can't pass through here, so it has to borrow a bit of your lane. At that time...

Speaker 2:
I was thinking that it would affect the speed of the car in front of me. The car in front would definitely slow down because...

Speaker 1:
It is turning, so the speed of the vehicle in front will decrease, and so will yours.

Speaker 2:
Yes, this kind of situation requires slowing down. Understand? Because there is a car on the left, and I have vehicles on both sides.

Speaker 1:
A three-wheeler.

Speaker 2:
Yes, a three-wheeler, so I have to slow down a bit and be cautious. I honked the horn.

Speaker 1:
You honked the horn? For the vehicle behind?

Speaker 2:
Yes, for the vehicle behind.

Speaker 1:
Because you felt the vehicle in front was moving erratically?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I felt it might suddenly accelerate or something, so I honked.

Speaker 1:
You honked at it. OK, maybe at this point, you had already passed it completely.

Speaker 2:
Yes.

Speaker 1:
Is there anything else on this road that you remember clearly?
Speaker 1:
You pressed the horn. Okay, at this point, you might have already overtaken him.

Speaker 2:
Yes.

Speaker 1:
Is there anything particularly memorable about this straight stretch? If not, I'll ask you some other questions.

Speaker 2:
It's just this straight stretch.

Speaker 1:
Let's go over it one more time.

Speaker 2:
When I went over it the last time, everything was fine until the U-turn at the end.

Speaker 1:
At this point, you honk to let him know, and then you overtake him. Yes, that's necessary.

Speaker 2:
To let him know?

Speaker 1:
So, you prefer to honk before overtaking from the left side. Yes, that's it.

Speaker 2:
I think it's a safer behavior. I believe it's a good practice.

Speaker 1:
It's like you're giving way to them or overtaking them.

Speaker 1:
At this point, oh, you're making a left turn, but he still...

Speaker 2:
Yes, he still gives way. On such roads, you might need to wait a bit.

Speaker 1:
When making a left turn, you need to be a bit more cautious. You felt the cars were far from you, right?

Speaker 2:
Just a slight turn.

Speaker 1:
No problem. You don't need to...

Speaker 1:
We're almost done here. I'll ask you a few more questions. To ensure the safety of this experiment, what aspects of driving did you pay special attention to? Because this might be different from driving your own car and the mental cues you give yourself.

Speaker 2:
Probably during the turns.

Speaker 1:
You observe more carefully during turns.

Speaker 2:
Often, I might check the rearview mirror three or four times during a turn, which I usually don't do. I wanted to be precise for this experiment, so I was extra cautious, especially during turns.

Speaker 1:
What do you think makes driving safer? Or what actions can you take to drive more safely?

Speaker 2:
For example, honking when overtaking.

Speaker 1:
Yes, it makes it a bit safer.

Speaker 2:
If I were the car in front and someone honked at me from behind, I would definitely check the situation.

Speaker 1:
Besides honking, what other actions do you take?

Speaker 2:
If there are pedestrians in your lane...

Speaker 1:
You steer a bit more to the left.

Speaker 2:
Yes, just a bit. And when merging from an auxiliary road to a main road, if there are no cars, I merge quickly. The traffic light might still be changing.

Speaker 1:
It's a bit long. No problem, I'll ask you something else.
Interviewer: If there are no cars, you can quickly get in. About the light changing at that time...

Interviewee: It's a bit long. No problem, I'll ask you something else. Why do you usually drive directly from here?

Interviewer: You didn't take a photo of this part.

Interviewee: At that time, it was short, but it still crossed the non-motorized lane. Okay, no problem. Can you recall your usual driving experiences? What situations make you feel scared?

Interviewee: Driving on the highway at night.

Interviewer: Driving on the highway at night. Why are you scared of the highway at night?

Interviewee: There are no lights on the highway, except at toll stations.

Interviewer: So, only the car's own headlights?

Interviewee: Yes, only the car's own headlights. This can make visibility poor.

Interviewer: How far do you think you can see with your headlights? Do you use high beams?

Interviewee: I usually don't use high beams, just low beams.

Interviewer: With low beams, how far can you see? 50 meters?

Interviewee: Yes, I can see 50 meters with low beams.

Interviewer: Can you see 100 meters?

Interviewee: It might be a bit blurry at 100 meters, but 50 meters is clear.

Interviewer: I understand. And you drive faster at night on the highway?

Interviewee: Yes, generally faster at night because there are fewer cars, around 120-130 km/h.

Interviewer: Besides driving on the highway at night, what other situations in the city make you cautious?

Interviewee: In the city, it’s usually when it's congested, and you have to change lanes. For example, if you need to exit the main road but it's already jammed, you have to merge into the lane.

Interviewer: So, you have to force your way in?

Interviewee: Yes, you have to be careful.

Interviewer: Are you afraid that the cars won't let you in?

Interviewee: I'm not afraid, just cautious. When merging, you have to do it gradually and seize the opportunity to get in.

Interviewer: But if they don't let you in, it can be easy to collide.

Interviewee: Yes, you have to wait for someone to let you in.

Interviewer: So, you're afraid of a collision when merging?

Interviewee: Yes, especially when turning, you might focus on the front and not the back or sides. You might accelerate to merge and not notice the car behind you also accelerating, leading to a collision.
Speaker 1:
So, you were trying to merge into traffic and then accelerated. Right, but maybe you didn't see that the car behind you also accelerated. Yes, and then both cars ended up colliding. 

Speaker 2:
Yes, because merging into traffic often leads to such situations.

Speaker 1:
Got it. Do you think you have any bad driving habits that could potentially lead to dangerous situations?

Speaker 2:
I might have some bad driving habits, but I can't think of any specific ones right now.

Speaker 1:
When you're a passenger in someone else's car, what kind of driving behavior makes you feel nervous?

Speaker 2:
Speeding.

Speaker 1:
Speeding? Do you mean the absolute speed or the rate of acceleration?

Speaker 2:
The absolute speed. When the speed reaches around 150 or 140 km/h, I start to feel nervous. If I'm driving, I might not feel as anxious, but as a passenger, it's different.

Speaker 1:
Besides speeding, are there any other situations in city driving that make you anxious?

Speaker 2:
Yes, when I'm a passenger and the car is driving fast on a ring road, especially if the speed reaches around 80 km/h and there are many cars around. If the driver changes lanes quickly and the cars are close to each other, I get worried. In other situations, I might not be as concerned.

Speaker 1:
So, you get anxious when there are multiple lanes of traffic moving at high speeds and the driver changes lanes quickly?

Speaker 2:
Yes, especially when the lane changes are abrupt and aggressive.

Speaker 1:
Is it the jerky motion of accelerating and braking that makes you uncomfortable, or is it the feeling that the car might collide with others?

Speaker 2:
It's mainly because the car is too close to other vehicles. That's what makes me nervous.

Speaker 1:
I see. You feel anxious when the car is too close to others.

Speaker 2:
Yes, definitely.

Speaker 1:
Got it. Do you think there were any dangerous situations during our driving test today?

Speaker 2:
No, I didn't notice any.

Speaker 1:
Alright. When you drive, do you consider the comfort of your passengers?

Speaker 2:
Not really.

Speaker 1:
What do you do to make the ride more comfortable for your passengers?

Speaker 2:
I try to reduce the speed and accelerate more gently. I also make sure to take turns more smoothly.

Speaker 1:
So, you ease off the gas pedal and avoid sudden accelerations?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. And I take wider turns to make them smoother.
Speaker 1: The second point is about the acceleration when you start driving.

Speaker 2: Yes, you need to press the gas pedal gently.

Speaker 1: Exactly, gently. The second point is to take wide turns whenever possible and avoid sharp turns.

Speaker 2: Yes, wide turns.

Speaker 1: Sharp turns can make passengers uncomfortable, especially if you make a quick U-turn. If you're alone, it might be fine, but with passengers, you should turn more slowly.

Speaker 2: I understand. For example, during the test drive, you made a quick U-turn by shifting to reverse and immediately turning the wheel from left to right. I get it. Is there anything else you focus on for passenger comfort?

Speaker 1: Try to change lanes less frequently.

Speaker 2: Yes, frequent lane changes can make passengers uncomfortable.

Speaker 1: Do you think you have any bad driving habits that might make passengers uncomfortable?

Speaker 2: My bad driving habits? Should I let someone else say it?

Speaker 1: You can start with your own thoughts.

Speaker 2: My bad habits might be driving too fast, making sharp turns, and quick starts. I think my braking is good, but I can't think of anything else. I feel like I drive safely, but passengers might feel it's dangerous.

Speaker 1: When you're a passenger in someone else's car, what makes you uncomfortable? Previously, I asked about feeling unsafe, but now I'm asking about discomfort.

Speaker 2: Discomfort? I haven't really felt uncomfortable as a passenger.

Speaker 1: So, you have a higher tolerance for discomfort?

Speaker 2: Yes, I haven't felt uncomfortable, just sometimes a bit worried.

Speaker 1: What do you think you can do to make passengers more comfortable? Based on your current driving, what additional steps can you take?

Speaker 2: Maintain a steady speed, avoid sudden acceleration or deceleration. Smooth braking and starting are also important. And take turns more slowly when possible.

Speaker 1: Would you like to check the data from the passenger feedback handles?

Speaker 2: Did they press them?

Speaker 1: Yes, they did.

Speaker 2: No need to lie to me. I'll ask them next week if they pressed it, and they'll say no.

Speaker 1: They might forget.

Speaker 2: This is my...

Speaker 1: At least, I will filter this information.
Speaker 1:
He said he didn't press it afterward.

Speaker 2:
Oh, I forgot. Is that so?

Speaker 1:
Yes, at least. Let me filter this. This is the control, wait, SOP number 1. Can you help me check the time? For example, this starts at 3:33, right? 59 seconds. Only 59 seconds, so this was pressed at the start.

Speaker 2:
It was pressed during the test.

Speaker 1:
So he said he didn't press it afterward. Okay, I understand now. Yes, he didn't press it.

Speaker 2:
I was driving quite steadily, haha.

Speaker 1:
And this is...

Speaker 2:
Wow, that's quite a lot now.

Speaker 1:
Let me check, is this also pressed during the test? There's one at 41 minutes 30 seconds, 43 minutes 04 seconds, 44 minutes 45 seconds, and...

Speaker 2:
50 minutes 07 or 08, right.

Speaker 1:
07 counts as 0. Yes. Okay, let's look for it in the panoramic view. Alright.

Speaker 2:
Take a look.

Speaker 1:
You can take a photo, and I'll expand it for you later. What time does the panoramic view start?

Speaker 2:
8 minutes 30 seconds.

Speaker 1:
8 minutes, the first one is 8 minutes 30 seconds, right? Can you check the value of 'n' at 8 minutes 30 seconds? Is that the first one?

Speaker 1:
It's 8 minutes 30 seconds, the first one in the 40-minute mark, the 41-minute mark.

Speaker 2:
Is it light?

Speaker 1:
Was it pressed lightly? Maybe there was a bit of acceleration, you were in a straight-line acceleration phase, and the passenger might have felt it was a bit fast. After making a U-turn, you accelerated, right? The passenger might have felt the acceleration was a bit abrupt. Maybe he pressed the handle, but I'm not sure what he felt. 8 minutes 30 seconds.

Speaker 2:
Did he want to press it during the U-turn but didn't? He probably wanted to press it during the U-turn.

Speaker 1:
Okay, he reacted a bit slowly. Yes, a slow reaction, just after the U-turn.

Speaker 2:
Yes, just after the U-turn. Definitely.

Speaker 1:
I think the acceleration might have caused it. The next one is at 43 minutes, 43 minutes 04 seconds. Is that right?

Speaker 2:
And the start time might be a bit off because...

Speaker 1:
There are a few seconds' differences. 13:04, why does it feel different? Let me check if it was pressed more. Yes, it was pressed.

Speaker 2:
Too low, the next one, right?

Speaker 1:
The one at 44 minutes, 44 minutes 45 seconds, this one was definitely pressed. It was pressed quite a bit.

Speaker 2:
11 minutes 45 seconds.

Speaker 1:
Why is that?

Speaker 2:
Is it because...

Speaker 1:
You need to look a bit before and after, because the start time... How many seconds should I look before and after? About 15 seconds should be enough to see. Is it this turn? Or this turn...
Speaker 1:
You need to be more observant, especially at the beginning. How many seconds should I look around? About 15 seconds should be enough to notice. Is it this turn? Or is it this turn, and then the speed is quite fast?

Speaker 2:
It should be when the car passes this car.

Speaker 1:
Which car are you talking about?

Speaker 2:
The car on the right, not the one behind. I think it should be this section; otherwise, there wouldn't be a camera angle. Right? It should accelerate through these two points.

Speaker 1:
Got it. So, the next one is the last one, right? Yes, 50 points, 0708. This should also be around 17 minutes, right? 0708, 57 points. I'll start from 17 minutes.

Speaker 2:
Yes.

Speaker 1:
This is the last U-turn, the final one.

Speaker 2:
That U-turn was okay. So, what do you mean by the most important thing? Throughout the process, the most important thing is to stay focused, right? Because here you are very close to other cars.

Speaker 1:
Yes, we hadn't seen this part yet.

Speaker 2:
Right, right. Where were we looking at earlier?

Speaker 1:
We had seen this part. Yes, at the traffic light. Right, this scene.

Speaker 2:
Yes, and then the car passed, and we roughly finished looking at the data. Let's leave it for now. Oh, I have a few more questions to add. These questions might not be as easy to answer as the previous ones. You can think about them, and then we can discuss them in detail. Let's start with the first question: What do you think makes a good driver or a professional driver?

Speaker 2:
A good driver and a professional driver.

Speaker 1:
Yes, a good driver or a professional driver. What do you think they need to do to be called that?

Speaker 2:
First, to be a good driver, you need to have ethics. Basic road ethics, like yielding to pedestrians and other vehicles. Even if your skills are excellent, you must still be courteous to others on the road.

Speaker 1:
Right, you can't be uncivilized.

Speaker 2:
That's one evaluation. I think the most important thing is your moral character. The second point is your skills. Combining both ethics and skills makes a good driver. As for a professional driver, are you referring to someone who drives for others?

Speaker 1:
I mean someone who drives very professionally.

Speaker 2:
That would be someone who handles complex traffic situations very well. For example, have you seen any particularly complex road conditions where the driver managed them skillfully?
Speaker 1:
So, in complex road conditions, how well does it handle? For example, have you encountered any particularly complex road conditions where you managed well? You mentioned a U-turn earlier, right?

Speaker 2:
The U-turn wasn't too complex.

Speaker 1:
We didn't discuss anything particularly challenging today.

Speaker 2:
Yes, the U-turn was probably the most complex situation today.

Speaker 1:
Let's talk about more complex scenarios.

Speaker 2:
For instance, if the car in front suddenly decelerates or brakes hard, this is when a driver needs experience. You shouldn't immediately change lanes when the car in front brakes. This can easily cause accidents. Instead, you should first slow down and then consider changing lanes. If you're driving and the car in front suddenly brakes, your instinct might be to swerve, but this could cause a collision with a car on your right.

Speaker 1:
So, in such situations, you should reduce speed rather than change lanes, right?

Speaker 2:
Exactly. 

Speaker 1:
Do you think this is a matter of experience or skill?

Speaker 2:
It's a combination of both. Experience and skill go hand in hand. The more experience you have, the better your skills become.

Speaker 1:
I see. What do you think is the biggest difference between experienced and new drivers?

Speaker 2:
The biggest difference is in vehicle control, particularly with the accelerator and brake. 

Speaker 1:
How to coordinate them better?

Speaker 2:
Yes, and how to make the ride more comfortable for passengers. As a driver, especially if you're a ride-share driver, your goal is not only to reach the destination but also to ensure passenger comfort. Both new and experienced drivers can reach the destination safely, but comfort is key. For instance, avoiding abrupt stops and starts is crucial.

Speaker 1:
So, driving smoothly is important.

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. 

Speaker 1:
What does "three-point braking" mean?

Speaker 2:
It means braking three times in quick succession. If you misjudge the distance to the car in front, you might brake once, realize you're still too close, brake again, and then brake a third time to stop completely. This can be uncomfortable for passengers.

Speaker 1:
I understand. Accelerating too quickly can also be an issue.

Speaker 2:
Yes, starting off too quickly can be jarring for passengers.
Speaker 1: Because serving passengers might just be like that. Oh, I see. Starting with a quick acceleration, bam, one push on the gas.

Speaker 1: Besides vehicle control.

Speaker 2: Yes, vehicle control.

Speaker 1: Apart from vehicle control, what else?

Speaker 2: The difference between experienced drivers and new drivers is in vehicle control.

Speaker 1: So, the biggest gap, do you think it's still vehicle control? Nothing else?

Speaker 2: Everything stems from your control of the vehicle. If you have good control, it reflects that you've been driving for a long time. You're also very familiar with the roads, and this familiarity with the roads and your vehicle is crucial.

Speaker 1: The ability to adapt to situations.

Speaker 2: Yes, the ability to react on the spot is also a very key factor.

Speaker 1: Hmm, the next question is, what aspects do you think autonomous vehicles can never achieve like humans?

Speaker 2: Let me think about this. I think autonomous driving is still very advanced. For example, Volvo's obstacle avoidance system. Do you know about that?

Speaker 1: Volvo's obstacle avoidance system? Yes, its active system.

Speaker 2: Yes, its obstacle avoidance system is something humans can't achieve. This is beyond human capability, I think.

Speaker 1: You mean it surpasses human reaction? Yes, exactly.

Speaker 2: This is something humans can't achieve. If we talk about intelligent driving, the difference between it and humans might be in terms of morality and yielding. This is the biggest difference between humans and robots.

Speaker 1: By yielding, do you mean humans are more likely to yield, or robots are more likely to yield?

Speaker 2: No, I think humans are more likely to yield, personally.

Speaker 1: You think humans are more likely to yield? Yes.

Speaker 2: Humans have emotions.

Speaker 1: But many traffic congestion problems occur because people don't yield or follow the rules and instead compete with each other. Do you think this is just an exception?

Speaker 2: In my experience, including drivers like me, road rage is relatively rare. Yes, it's relatively rare. Malicious behavior like deliberately not giving way is uncommon. Most people, I think, are still okay. For robots, AI learning human emotions is still quite difficult. That's my personal opinion.

Speaker 1: But they strictly follow traffic rules, right? This is also an emotional aspect. It's a double-edged sword. Humans are supposed to follow these rules, but some people don't.

Speaker 1: When they don't follow the rules, they benefit. But if everyone doesn't follow the rules, no one benefits, and everyone ends up stuck. Only when a few people don't follow the rules do they gain an advantage.

Speaker 2: I think traffic congestion is...
Speaker 1:
When there's a profit to be made, everyone tends to crowd in the same place. It's only when a few people don't follow the rules that those few might benefit. 

Speaker 2:
I think traffic congestion happens because a few people don't follow the rules. For example, if you look around and see that the car next to you is very close, and you need to change lanes, but there's not enough space to do it smoothly, you need to slow down. This will definitely affect the speed of the car behind you.

Speaker 1:
Yes, because if you suddenly change lanes, the car behind you will have to slow down.

Speaker 2:
Exactly. This is a matter of driving ethics. Even if you miss an exit, you can always turn around at the next one. It's a matter of consideration for others.

Speaker 1:
How do you judge the intentions, distance, and speed of other pedestrians, cyclists, and cars while driving?

Speaker 2:
I don't make specific judgments. I assess the level of threat they pose to me.

Speaker 1:
So, how do you determine what they are going to do?

Speaker 2:
I don't need to think too much about it. For example, if a car is approaching from the side, I might hesitate for a split second to see if it will change lanes. If it does, it will need some space and time to do so.

Speaker 1:
So, you predict their trajectory based on their behavior to judge their intentions.

Speaker 2:
Yes, based on the road conditions. If it's a straight road, the chances of them changing lanes are very small. Even if they do, if they are far away, it doesn't matter.

Speaker 1:
What about pedestrian crossings?

Speaker 2:
I check both sides of the crossing. If there are no pedestrians waiting, and if a vehicle is moving forward with a large truck blocking its way, I will definitely move to the left and accelerate to overtake it.

Speaker 1:
So, you would accelerate to overtake it?

Speaker 2:
Yes, if I maintain the same speed as the truck, we would reach the crossing at the same time, which could be dangerous. So, I would accelerate to pass it.
Speaker 1:
Would you overtake it? If I maintain a similar speed, we would both reach the large roundabout at the same time.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I would overtake it. Definitely.

Speaker 1:
What about when you encounter pedestrians? Would you accelerate?

Speaker 2:
In such cases, I would definitely slow down.

Speaker 1:
For instance, on a road like this, if there's a pedestrian standing there wanting to cross, how do you determine if they are just standing there or if they really intend to cross the road?

Speaker 2:
If they really want to cross, they would start walking. If they don't want to cross, they would stand at the very edge of the road. If they want to cross, they might already be in the middle of the crosswalk.

Speaker 1:
But if they are just standing there, how do you judge if they want to cross or are just waiting for something or someone?

Speaker 2:
If they are standing there, why should I assume they are waiting for something like a ride? If they want to cross, I would definitely let them.

Speaker 1:
If they are at a position where you can't stop in time, what would you do?

Speaker 2:
If they are at a position where I can't stop in time, I wouldn't be able to let them cross. Even if I brake hard, it might not be enough unless it's an emergency stop.

Speaker 1:
So, you mean the distance is too short for you to brake or for them to cross safely?

Speaker 2:
Yes, they would know that too. If the distance is too short, they wouldn't attempt to cross.

Speaker 1:
If your car is a bit further away, and they start walking, what would you do?

Speaker 2:
If they start walking, I would definitely slow down and let them cross.

Speaker 1:
So, you would brake and let them pass?

Speaker 2:
Yes, if they are already on the crosswalk, I would let them pass, even if it means stopping completely.

Speaker 1:
Even if you have to steer to avoid them?

Speaker 2:
I wouldn't steer to avoid them; I would brake hard instead.

Speaker 1:
So, your judgment is based on the distance between you and the pedestrian, the time they need to cross, and the distance you need to brake.

Speaker 2:
Exactly.

Speaker 1:
Ultimately, it's about whether there's a risk of hitting them.

Speaker 2:
Yes, that's the basic judgment.

Speaker 1:
If there's a high chance of hitting them, then neither swerving nor braking would help. You just hope they don't step out suddenly.

Speaker 2:
If someone suddenly appears, like from behind a parked truck, no one can react in time. In such cases, it's impossible to predict.
Speaker 1:
Do you think it's easier to predict the intentions of pedestrians, non-motorized vehicles, or cars?

Speaker 2:
Cars are the easiest to predict because they are larger and generally follow their designated lanes. Pedestrians are usually farther from the cars, so they are easier to anticipate. The hardest to predict are non-motorized vehicles like bicycles and tricycles, especially in smaller towns.

Speaker 1:
When you go back to your hometown, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, when I go back to my hometown, the streets are often crowded with both people and vehicles.

Speaker 1:
They don't always follow traffic lights and just cross the street directly, right?

Speaker 2:
Exactly.

Speaker 1:
In such situations, when there are many people crossing the road and the traffic lights are ignored or not working, what do you do when you need to pass through the intersection? Do you slow down?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I slow down and yield.

Speaker 1:
So you wait until everyone has crossed before you proceed?

Speaker 2:
Absolutely.

Speaker 1:
But what if waiting for everyone to cross takes a very long time, and you might miss the light?

Speaker 2:
Even then, I would wait. It's important to ensure everyone's safety.

Speaker 1:
So you always choose to yield completely.

Speaker 2:
Yes, definitely. Even if I have a green light, if someone is about to cross the zebra crossing, I will wait.

Speaker 1:
I understand. What about a situation where a pedestrian hesitates, seeing you approach, and both of you are unsure whether to proceed or stop? You might be going at a slow speed, around 20 km/h. How do you decide whether to let them go or proceed yourself?

Speaker 2:
If the pedestrian hesitates and stops, it usually means they want to let me pass. But in such situations, I always choose to stop and let them go first. It's easier for me to control the car's speed than for them to decide when to cross.

Speaker 1:
We often see situations where both the driver and the pedestrian hesitate and end up standing still, trying to let each other go. How do you handle that?

Speaker 2:
In those cases, I always stop and let the pedestrian go. It's safer and more predictable for everyone involved.
Speaker 1:
It's like when you're driving a regular car and you come to a crosswalk. Sometimes, both the driver and the pedestrian try to yield to each other, and then both end up standing still. Then, one decides to go, but the other does too, and they both stop again. It's a bit of a dance.

Speaker 2:
I've never encountered that situation myself, but I can imagine it happening.

Speaker 1:
Even if you haven't experienced it while driving, you might have while walking.

Speaker 2:
Yes, like when two people are walking towards each other and both try to move out of the way but end up moving in the same direction. It's tricky.

Speaker 1:
So, as a driver, how would you handle this situation to let the pedestrian know your intentions?

Speaker 2:
Are you asking if an accident has already happened?

Speaker 1:
No, no accident. Just how you would communicate your intentions to the pedestrian.

Speaker 2:
That's one of the differences between humans and intelligent systems, right?

Speaker 1:
Yes.

Speaker 2:
Besides waving your hand, what other methods do you think would work?

Speaker 1:
If you want to let the pedestrian go, you could wait for a couple of seconds. If they see your car isn't moving, they'll likely cross. If you don't want to let them go, you could honk the horn.

Speaker 2:
Yes, using the horn to signal them. You can't shout at them.

Speaker 1:
Do you have any other questions or points to add?

Speaker 2:
No, I think that's it. We can finish watching the video. I almost forgot about it. It’s just a little bit left. When the situation changes, you won't be stuck anymore. When you turn right, there won't be any issues.

Speaker 1:
Yes, exactly. Speed up. No problem. At this point, your speed should be around 60 km/h, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, around 60. Will there be a long wait here?

Speaker 1:
It should be fine overall.

Speaker 2:
Alright, let's wrap it up. I don't think there's much more to cover. Our interview is almost done. I’ll give you the materials we discussed for your review.

Speaker 1:
Great, thank you. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me. You can also check your mobile banking for any updates.

Speaker 2:
How did you find the process of participating in our experiment today?

Speaker 1:
I think the process was quite well-organized.
Speaker 1:
How did you find the process of participating in our experiment today?

Speaker 2:
I think the process was quite well-organized and user-friendly. It was really good.

Speaker 1:
Was there anything that made you feel uncomfortable or any issues you encountered? Please feel free to tell me, as we are constantly working to improve the process.

Speaker 2:
Honestly, there was nothing from start to finish. I think you have considered a lot of details, and T3 was also very good.

Speaker 1:
Have you participated in any other experimental projects before?

Speaker 2:
No, I haven't.

Speaker 1:
Alright, thank you. Could you please provide the channel information?
