**Transcript:**

**Speaker 1:**
Is it ready? Can you hear me?

**Speaker 1:**
Hmm, let's test this microphone first.

**Speaker 1:**
Hello, hello, it seems like...

**Speaker 1:**
Hello, hello, hello, it seems like the sound from your side is a bit low.

**Speaker 2:**
Can you hear me now?

**Speaker 1:**
How about now? Hello, hello, hello, can you stand a bit further and say something? I want to see if it will still pick up your voice.

**Speaker 2:**
Are you using the computer's built-in microphone?

**Speaker 1:**
It seems like it's not recognizing it. Yes, it's the first time using this interaction.

**Speaker 1:**
Hello, hello, hello, does it seem okay now? You speak, and I'll see what it records. Hello, hello, are you in the meeting?

**Speaker 1:**
If your computer is good, just use your computer's microphone. You can't see it clearly on your side, right? Sorry, that's my issue.

**Speaker 1:**
Shall I send it to you?

**Speaker 1:**
Okay, okay, okay. I'll turn off the sound here. How about now? Is there no echo now? Testing this, yes, hello, hello, okay, you say something on your side. Hmm, okay. Can you turn up your speaker a bit?

**Speaker 2:**
You are using two microphones, it will sound different.

**Speaker 1:**
Where is the charger? Can it speed up?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't check the brightness, it's set too low.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, let's leave it like this. You send me the summary, but the project import is a bit slow.

**Speaker 2:**
I'll do it this way, you mute your microphone on your side. Which microphone? The one in the Tencent meeting, you still have that sound on.

**Speaker 1:**
Why should I mute it? Shouldn't it be on? Oh, I understand, okay, is it good now? Yes, and this is the recording of your driving session. Okay, and the red area shows where your eyes were looking at that time. Got it, let me move it to the point where we triggered the event. Is this your phone? Yes, let me confirm, so I don't show you the wrong video, which would be awkward. It's mine, okay, I'll share my screen now. Got it. Did I share it?

**Speaker 2:**
Let me check, no, not yet.

**Speaker 1:**
Okay, I'm sharing now. Cool, alright, I understand. I can't turn on the speaker, you turn it on. Yes, you turn it on, and then the screen sound will come from your computer, right? Then I'll ask you a few simple questions first. Okay, and before the interview, I want to emphasize that all the data we collect will be anonymized and your personal information will not be disclosed. Okay, then we will watch this video together.
Speaker 1:
Yes, all the data we collect will be anonymized and your personal privacy will not be disclosed. Alright, then we will watch this video together. We will explore your driving habits, and if you find anything interesting, feel free to stop the video and let me know. I will also stop the video if I have any questions. Don't worry, we can just chat casually. If there are any questions you don't want to answer, just let me know. I will start by asking you some simple questions about your driving habits, and we will keep the video on standby.

Speaker 2:
I can't play the sound because it's muted. I shared my screen, but my local computer is muted.

Speaker 1:
Oh, I see. Do you have sound on your end?

Speaker 2:
No, my system shows output, but it's muted.

Speaker 1:
It shows there is sound output, but you have the speakers turned up to the maximum, right? Try selecting the output device.

Speaker 2:
You try playing it.

Speaker 1:
If we don't need sound, we can proceed without it. The radar in the video is constantly beeping anyway. Since we are in a parking lot, let's not worry about it. I'll start by asking you some simple questions. What types of cars have you driven before this experiment? You mentioned you have driven an SUV, which is higher. Have you driven an electric car?

Speaker 2:
No, apart from electric cars, gasoline cars, SUVs, and the sedan we are driving today, I haven't driven anything else.

Speaker 1:
Have you driven a manual transmission?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I have.

Speaker 1:
Any other types of cars?

Speaker 2:
No, just the usual types.

Speaker 1:
Got it. Have you driven any cars with advanced driver-assistance features, like cruise control or automatic start-stop?

Speaker 2:
No, I haven't used those features, even in new electric cars.

Speaker 1:
What electric car did you drive?

Speaker 2:
I drove a BYD electric car.

Speaker 1:
Does it have similar features?

Speaker 2:
It should have, but I didn't try them. It was my friend's car.

Speaker 1:
Do you usually drive short distances or long distances?

Speaker 2:
It varies. Mostly commuting in Beijing or going out for leisure.

Speaker 1:
How long are your drives typically?

Speaker 2:
There is no fixed route or duration.

Speaker 1:
Alright. How do you feel about the car we are driving today?

Speaker 2:
I think this...
Speaker 2:
Yes, there isn't a fixed route.

Speaker 1:
Right. So, how do you feel about the car today?

Speaker 2:
I think the car is quite smooth and stable. It doesn't make a lot of noise or vibrations at low RPMs.

Speaker 1:
That's because you're using the electronic system at lower RPMs.

Speaker 2:
Yes, it feels different. When I drive a purely mechanical car, it tends to vibrate a lot at low RPMs.

Speaker 1:
Exactly, it can be quite shaky.

Speaker 2:
Yes, the engine tends to vibrate a lot. But this car is very smooth and refined. However, I feel that the steering isn't very precise.

Speaker 1:
I understand. When you turn the wheel slightly, it doesn't respond as sharply.

Speaker 2:
Right, but overall, the driving experience is good. The chassis is quite solid.

Speaker 1:
Now, this next question might be a bit sensitive. You can choose to answer or not. Have you ever been involved in a traffic accident?

Speaker 2:
No, I've never been in an accident with another vehicle. However, I have scraped my car a few times, but only against curbs or poles.

Speaker 1:
For example, hitting a curb or a post?

Speaker 2:
Yes, it was at night, and it was very dark. The car is quite high, and the post was low, so I couldn't see it from the driver's seat. I ended up hitting it.

Speaker 1:
Alright, in the video, after we leave the parking lot, I'll ask you about your turning habits. For instance, when you approach the first turn onto the main road, how do you usually observe the surroundings?

Speaker 2:
First, I check the navigation to confirm we're turning right at the intersection. Before turning, I look to the right to see if there are any cars coming from either side. Since we're turning right, I need to make sure there are no oncoming vehicles that might collide with us during the turn. Generally, I look left first, then right.

Speaker 1:
So today, did you look left first?

Speaker 2:
No, usually at intersections, I look left first.

Speaker 1:
But today, we were turning right.

Speaker 2:
Yes, but I still looked left first because the car was facing west.

Speaker 1:
So, you looked east first?

Speaker 2:
Yes, since the car was facing west, I looked east first.
Speaker 1: Did you look at this first?

Speaker 2: Yes, because the car's front was facing west. So, if I'm driving west, I would definitely look east first.

Speaker 1: Right? Oh, nothing, just that black car's maneuver ahead startled me a bit. Oh, it forced its way into the exit.

Speaker 2: Yes.

Speaker 1: So, when you usually make turns, your habit is to operate like today, meaning you look first. For example, when turning right, you would look at the screen first, then check the right side, and observe the surroundings. On the left side, what do you mainly observe?

Speaker 2: Because I need to merge onto this road, if...

Speaker 1: If there are oncoming cars, I need to yield.

Speaker 2: Yes, if the oncoming vehicle doesn't yield, I need to observe if it slows down or if there are any cars coming from that direction.

Speaker 1: And on the right side, what do you usually observe?

Speaker 2: Mainly non-motorized vehicles and pedestrians.

Speaker 1: Got it. Let's continue. In this section, there might be more non-motorized vehicles. Yes, and in such situations, they might occupy your lane more aggressively. I remember you asked me during the test drive if you could honk. Yes, honking is a method you prefer.

Speaker 2: Yes, but since it's not nighttime...

Speaker 1: You could also flash your lights.

Speaker 2: Yes, but flashing high beams might not be as effective in warning them. Sometimes, when encountering vehicles that don't signal when turning, honking is a way to alert them. I think it's a form of defensive driving.

Speaker 1: Understood. In situations where there are many non-motorized vehicles and the lane is occupied by motor vehicles, how do you usually handle it?

Speaker 2: It depends on whether the lane is wide enough. If the lane isn't very wide...

Speaker 1: In such cases, you can't pass through.

Speaker 2: I would brake and let them pass first. If the lane is wide enough and I judge that the distance is sufficient, I would quickly overtake.

Speaker 1: How do you usually judge the right side, especially the front right distance? Many drivers, especially new ones, struggle with this.

Speaker 2: It's hard to say. It depends on your sense of direction and overall feel for the car's dimensions.

Speaker 1: Does it matter if you've driven the car before? Because today is your first time driving this model, and you seem to have a good sense of it.

Speaker 2: When you first get into a car, you need to adjust your position and get a rough estimate of the car's dimensions. I can usually see the hood, and then you can...
First, you need to adjust your seat position properly. Then, you should get a rough estimate of the car's dimensions and get a feel for what the car is like. For example, I can see a bit of the hood, which helps me gauge the car's size. When you're sitting in the car, the distance you see is actually a bit wider than the actual distance.

Speaker 1:
Yes, it might feel like that.

Speaker 2:
Exactly, but there's actually a bit of a gap. Since I've been driving a lot since I got my license, I can usually estimate that I can make it through.

Speaker 1:
Where were you looking at this time? I noticed you glanced around several times.

Speaker 2:
I was looking at the mirrors. I felt that the side mirror wasn't quite right, like it was a bit off.

Speaker 1:
So you checked it again because it felt off?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I was checking because I felt it was a bit low.

Speaker 1:
Were you also worried about something behind you, like it might be difficult?

Speaker 2:
At that point, I was mainly checking the angle of the side mirror. Since we were driving in the same direction and there was no oncoming traffic, I didn't need to check the left mirror much because it was a one-way street. So, I started adjusting my side mirror.

Speaker 1:
And here, you were merging onto the main road. Can you tell me about your usual habit when merging? We usually merge from the right.

Speaker 2:
I usually check the left mirror to observe the traffic on the main road. If there's an opportunity, I signal and then merge slowly. You can't change lanes continuously; you have to merge into the first lane and then gradually move over.

Speaker 1:
At that moment, could you see the main road? I noticed you were looking at the side mirror, but I couldn't tell if you could see the main road. The bushes were blocking your view, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I couldn't see it at that point. So, I adjusted the side mirror because the left mirror wasn't comfortable either.

Speaker 1:
It might have been because of the bushes.

Speaker 2:
Possibly, but I couldn't see it at that moment.

Speaker 1:
Even at this point, you could only see a little bit.

Speaker 2:
Yes, and since the car behind me was turning right, I could go ahead. So, I started adjusting the mirror.

Speaker 1:
Did the car behind you give way?

Speaker 2:
No, it was turning right.

Speaker 1:
I see, it was planning to turn right. Got it.

Speaker 2:
So, I started adjusting my left mirror because it felt awkward. Once the angle was right, I could see the car behind me clearly.

Speaker 1:
Then, you had a long straight stretch to accelerate.
Speaker 1:
At this point, the angle was right, and I could clearly see the car behind me.

Speaker 2:
Yes, this was during a long stretch of straight road where I was accelerating.

Speaker 1:
When you're driving on a long, straight road with good conditions, what speed do you usually maintain?

Speaker 2:
I usually drive at the upper limit of the speed limit for that road.

Speaker 1:
By the upper limit, do you mean just slightly over the speed limit? For example, if the speed limit is 80 km/h, you might go a bit over that?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. If the speed limit is 80 km/h, I might drive at around 83 km/h. I don't exceed the limit by much, but I also don't drive too slowly.

Speaker 1:
What kind of following distance do you usually maintain?

Speaker 2:
It depends on the situation.

Speaker 1:
Could you give an example?

Speaker 2:
In heavy traffic, like on the third or fourth ring roads, I keep a closer distance to the car in front of me.

Speaker 1:
How close is that?

Speaker 2:
From my driving position, I can see the license plate of the car in front of me. That's the distance I maintain.

Speaker 1:
So, you mean when there are a lot of cars on the road?

Speaker 2:
Yes, when the road is congested and traffic is slow.

Speaker 1:
And when the road is clear, you maintain a greater distance?

Speaker 2:
Yes, when traffic is flowing smoothly, I keep a greater distance because if the car in front suddenly brakes, I need enough time to react.

Speaker 1:
What about when you're driving at 40 km/h on a clear road?

Speaker 2:
I maintain a similar distance unless I want to overtake the car in front.

Speaker 1:
So, about one car length, around 5 meters?

Speaker 2:
Yes, that's about right.

Speaker 1:
And if you're driving at 60 km/h?

Speaker 2:
I increase the distance a bit more.

Speaker 1:
So, around two to three car lengths?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly.
Speaker 1: How about at 60 km/h?

Speaker 2: At 60 km/h, you should increase the following distance a bit more.

Speaker 1: So, it's roughly like this. This is three, not three, but two.

Speaker 2: Yes, roughly. It's about that feeling.

Speaker 1: If you're going 80 km/h or 100 km/h on the highway, how far should you be?

Speaker 2: How far? I wouldn't recommend tailgating on the highway.

Speaker 1: You mean you would just pass the car?

Speaker 2: Yes, exactly. I would try to overtake it. If I have to follow, I would maintain a safe distance based on the speed.

Speaker 1: On the highway, there are markers for 50 meters, 100 meters, and 150 meters. How do you usually maintain your distance?

Speaker 2: On the highway, I usually drive around 120 km/h.

Speaker 1: No, I mean the 50 meters, 100 meters, and 150 meters markers.

Speaker 2: It depends on the situation. If both cars are moving at a constant speed, I would maintain a distance of around 100 meters to ensure a safe gap.

Speaker 1: Here is a section for making a U-turn. How do you usually handle U-turns?

Speaker 2: Are you asking how I observe the surroundings?

Speaker 1: Yes, how do you observe and make the U-turn?

Speaker 2: I first check the traffic lights. If it's a red light and there are no oncoming cars, it's easier to make the turn. If it's a green light and there are oncoming cars, I give them the right of way because they have priority.

Speaker 1: So, you wait for them to pass.

Speaker 2: Yes, I wait for them. Also, my car has a longer wheelbase, so it might take more effort to make the turn.

Speaker 1: You can't make the turn in one go?

Speaker 2: Yes, sometimes I can't make it in one go because the car doesn't have rear-wheel steering. So, I need to check my rearview mirror when making the turn.

Speaker 1: Do you mean the side mirrors or the rearview mirror?

Speaker 2: The rearview mirror. If you need to reverse during the turn, you must check for oncoming traffic to avoid collisions. This car has a backup camera, so it helps.

Speaker 1: You don't rely solely on the backup camera?

Speaker 2: Yes, I still check the mirrors. 

Speaker 1: Today, did you encounter any interference from other cars?

Speaker 2: No, there wasn't any interference. The radar was quite helpful.

Speaker 1: I noticed something interesting. When you return the steering wheel, you like to let it slide back on its own. Is that right?

Speaker 2: Yes, I do that unless...
Speaker 1:
Hey, I noticed something interesting. When you turn the steering wheel back, you like to let go and let it return on its own, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, unless it's an urgent situation or I'm driving fast. If the road is slow, I usually turn the wheel and then let go, allowing it to naturally return to the center.

Speaker 1:
When you were approaching a right turn and a bus signaled to pull out, how did you handle that situation?

Speaker 2:
In that case, I would usually be ready to brake.

Speaker 1:
You didn't try to speed up?

Speaker 2:
No, because bus drivers tend to drive slowly and they usually don't yield. So, you have to be cautious and observe their actions. If they don't yield, you need to be prepared. In this case, I was in the leftmost lane, and the bus would likely move into the second lane from the right. If it directly moved into my lane, it would be their fault. But I still slowed down a bit in case the bus suddenly pulled out.

Speaker 1:
Ahead, there's another right turn. Is it hard to see because of the bushes?

Speaker 2:
It's manageable for cars, but it can be more obstructive for cyclists and pedestrians. You can't see them as well.

Speaker 1:
I remember during the test drive, a cyclist suddenly appeared from the right. Do you recall that?

Speaker 2:
Yes, but since I was driving slowly, it wasn't a big issue.

Speaker 1:
You yielded to the cyclist because they had already entered the road, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, you have to yield to them.

Speaker 1:
Did you have to wait long?

Speaker 2:
No, I just made the right turn directly.

Speaker 1:
The road conditions were good today, and you returned quickly. It took less than fifteen minutes. When cars are parked with their hazard lights on, do you pay special attention to them?

Speaker 2:
Yes, you have to watch out because sometimes they might open their doors suddenly.

Speaker 1:
So, you are cautious about "dooring" incidents?

Speaker 2:
Yes, especially if they don't signal and just open the door. If you're driving fast, it can be dangerous. But on this road, there are few parked cars, and during the day, there aren't many people around, so it's less of a concern. However, at night, it's different.
Speaker 2:
On this kind of road, you see there are very few cars parked on both sides, and during the day, there aren't many people around, so you don't need to worry too much. But if it's nighttime and you're driving through a residential area, you need to be extra cautious, especially for children. In areas with blind spots, you should drive a bit slower.

Speaker 1:
And there's a school here, did you notice that?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I noticed. This road doesn't have a speed limit at the end.

Speaker 1:
Is it 40 km/h? Yes, you noticed the black sign indicating the end of the 40 km/h speed limit, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, after you turn, there's also an end of speed limit sign on that road.

Speaker 1:
Got it. Is there anything else here?

Speaker 1:
During your entire driving session today, did you overtake any vehicles? Yes, during the formal experiment phase.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I did.

Speaker 1:
You should remember if you did. 

Speaker 2:
Yes, I did. It was when I turned left onto the road leading to the building, and I overtook a vehicle.

Speaker 1:
So, you overtook after making a U-turn back to the building, right?

Speaker 2:
No, it was after turning onto that road, making a figure-eight turn, and then turning right towards Dongtai.

Speaker 1:
On Chengfu Road?

Speaker 2:
Yes, on Chengfu Road, I overtook a vehicle.

Speaker 1:
Okay, I'll ask you more about that later. Because sometimes there might not be conditions suitable for overtaking, we might ask about your usual overtaking habits. When you approach intersections like this, how do you usually observe the surroundings?

Speaker 2:
I first look left, then right, and keep my foot on the brake.

Speaker 1:
What if there are many non-motorized vehicles or pedestrians?

Speaker 2:
Then you should slow down and keep your foot lightly on the brake, observing both sides. Mainly, you need to watch out for the blind spot around the B-pillar.

Speaker 1:
The B-pillar?

Speaker 2:
Yes, the B-pillar on this side. You need to pay attention to this area.

Speaker 1:
Got it. So, you focus more on the left side and less on the right?

Speaker 2:
No, you need to look at both sides. The main thing is to anticipate the road conditions and know where you're heading next.

Speaker 1:
This road has very few people. Let me ask you some other questions to ensure driving safety. What areas did you particularly focus on during your drive?

Speaker 2:
I just followed the instructions given during the test drive, driving a bit slower on that section of the road and maintaining a steady speed. I wasn't worried about anything else, except maybe the car's performance, handling, and the responsiveness of the brakes and accelerator.
**Speaker 1:**
The only concern I had was about the car's performance and handling, especially the braking power and the sensitivity of the accelerator. I didn't get a good feel for it during the test drive, so I wasn't confident enough to drive fast. Other than that, I didn't have any worries about the road conditions.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, during the official experiment, the second time driving, you start to get a feel for the car and can drive more comfortably. Except for the seat, which was really uncomfortable, and my foot felt a bit cramped.

**Speaker 1:**
Separate your feet.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. My foot felt restricted.

**Speaker 1:**
I understand. I had to lift my foot really high to move it to the brake on the left side.

**Speaker 2:**
You don't need to twist your foot, just lift it. I had to arch my foot a lot to control it. Normally, you wouldn't need to lift your foot that high. I understand what you mean, so your ankle might feel a bit sore, but other than that, there's nothing much to worry about.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you think driving can ensure safety?

**Speaker 2:**
Safety on the road is crucial.

**Speaker 1:**
You need to be observant and have a good sense of the road. What do you mean by road sense?

**Speaker 2:**
Road sense is having a clear understanding of the road. You need to be able to anticipate sudden changes. When you drive a lot, you can sense when a car wants to change lanes. It's about understanding what other drivers might do.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you think being able to predict what other cars want to do helps you react in advance?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. You need to drive defensively and be very cautious.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you usually judge the behavior of other cars on the road?

**Speaker 2:**
There are a few situations. First, keep your distance from large vehicles and buses. Avoid cars that are swerving. Try to avoid driving parallel to other cars in a three-lane situation. Just drive normally and keep a safe distance. The more you drive, the more skilled you become. With automatic cars, it's much easier.

**Speaker 1:**
You mentioned that this intersection is challenging because it doesn't have traffic lights.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I hesitated a bit when I got there.

**Speaker 1:**
I was looking to see if there were any signals.
Speaker 1:
At the traffic light, yes, I arrived there.

Speaker 2:
I hesitated for a moment because I was...

Speaker 1:
Looking to see if there were any cars. Yes, and then usually, there might be more cars. Yes, and you specifically checked, there were no cars coming from the left. Hmm, can you recall any particular driving experiences where you felt especially...

Speaker 2:
Scared? Yes, like when I got distracted.

Speaker 1:
Distracted.

Speaker 2:
Yes, like when you think about something else, and then the car in front...

Speaker 1:
Suddenly brakes.

Speaker 2:
Yes, and you didn't notice it, didn't pay attention. Then suddenly, the car in front brakes, and you react quickly, slamming on the brakes, which can startle you. Another situation is encountering reckless drivers who change lanes without signaling. On the ring road, where everyone drives fast, a car suddenly cuts in front of you. In such cases, you can't just...

Speaker 1:
You can't move, you can't avoid it, you can only slow down.

Speaker 2:
Yes, and that can be startling. So, generally, when driving, I habitually keep my hands on the wheel.

Speaker 1:
Hmm, besides these two situations, are there any others?

Speaker 2:
Not really, just those. Maybe when driving in the mountains...

Speaker 1:
Driving in the mountains with continuous downhill curves.

Speaker 2:
Yes, there might be blind spots, especially on continuous S-curves without mirrors. When you turn, you might get a bit nervous, worrying about oncoming traffic you can't see. You also worry about understeering, so you have to cut out a bit before turning. This can make you tense, but it’s rare since it’s usually when going out for fun.

Speaker 1:
Hmm, do you think you have any bad driving habits that could be dangerous?

Speaker 2:
Sometimes I smoke while driving, and I hate getting ash inside the car.

Speaker 1:
So you put your hand outside to flick the ash.

Speaker 2:
Yes, but I mainly worry about the ash blowing back inside, so I keep checking for it. Another dangerous habit is sometimes driving with one hand on the wheel. On city roads, it's fine, but on bumpy roads, if there's a pothole, it can be dangerous, especially for women who might not have a firm grip on the wheel. If the car jolts and they lose control of the wheel, it can be very dangerous. So, sometimes after driving for a long time...
Speaker 1: If there's a sudden jolt and she doesn't have a firm grip on the steering wheel, it can be dangerous, especially if there's oncoming traffic. Sometimes, when I've been driving for a long time or if there's heavy traffic and I'm tired, I might drive with one hand.

Speaker 2: Yes, like this, with your left hand?

Speaker 1: I'm left-handed, but I can use both hands. However, driving with one hand isn't very safe. I don't usually look at my phone while driving, but sometimes when I start driving, I might adjust something on my phone, which isn't very safe either. Other than that, I think I'm okay.

Speaker 2: What kind of behavior from other drivers makes you feel nervous or unsafe when you're a passenger?

Speaker 1: When someone doesn't really know how to drive. They might be able to get the car moving, but they don't truly understand driving. For example, their choices when changing lanes or their timing when braking can make a big difference. I believe a good driver should make passengers feel comfortable. I really dislike it when drivers brake abruptly, causing passengers to lurch forward.

Speaker 2: Like when they brake too late?

Speaker 1: Yes, exactly. It makes you bump your head, and then they accelerate suddenly. It's very uncomfortable and sometimes scary, especially when they change lanes erratically.

Speaker 2: So, it makes you feel both uncomfortable and scared?

Speaker 1: Yes, uncomfortable and scared. For instance, when they hesitate to change lanes or don't have the confidence to do so. I get anxious when I'm in the passenger seat and see a clear opportunity to change lanes, but they don't take it. They signal but don't move, which makes me feel unsafe. Or when approaching an intersection, like when my girlfriend was learning to drive, she would get confused if there were other cars. She didn't know that she could wait for the other car to pass before turning. She would start turning while the other car was still crossing, which made me very nervous.

Speaker 2: So, for example, if she needs to make a left turn and there's oncoming traffic, she might turn too quickly?

Speaker 1: Yes, she wouldn't stop in the middle of the turn, making the turn very wide. I would get very tense and tell her to stop because she was about to go too far. It's not the right way to drive. And then there's the issue of changing lanes and braking suddenly.
**Speaker 2:**
I was really nervous. I told him, "Don't drive any further, if you keep going, we'll be in trouble." He wasn't driving properly. Oh, I understand. And then, when changing lanes or something, he would brake suddenly. I was always worried he wouldn't stop in time. I was constantly afraid he would rear-end someone. Maybe I'm just scared of such things.

**Speaker 1:**
Hmm, for example, during the experiment today, was there any part that you felt was dangerous?

**Speaker 2:**
When I was test driving, there was that electric bike, the delivery guy, on the right.

**Speaker 1:**
You mean the one that suddenly made a U-turn and then turned again?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I felt like I didn't see it coming.

**Speaker 1:**
That was a bit dangerous, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Other than that, everything was fine.

**Speaker 1:**
Hmm, do you usually pay attention to the passengers' experience when you drive?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I do. I pay attention to whether they feel car sick and how they are feeling overall. 

**Speaker 1:**
Do you ask them directly?

**Speaker 2:**
Not always. Sometimes I just ask, "Are you feeling sick?" If they seem relaxed, not holding onto the handle or anything, I know they're fine. Sometimes, when someone sits in the front passenger seat, they might not even bother to fasten their seatbelt. They just sit there very relaxed.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you change your driving style depending on whether you have passengers or not?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it depends on who is in the car. If it's an elder, like my husband or my parents, I definitely won't drive too fast. If someone is likely to comment on my driving, I drive more carefully. For example, if there's a red light ahead, I might accelerate if I'm alone, but with them, I would slow down and glide through.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you switch between different driving modes?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, when I'm alone, I don't worry about saving fuel. But for the comfort of my passengers, I drive more smoothly, like not accelerating too quickly from a stop.
Speaker 2:
Yes, so you would deliberately do certain things. For example, when starting the car, I avoid stepping on the gas pedal too hard to prevent the engine from making a loud revving sound. When braking, I start slowing down early and brake gradually to ensure a smooth stop, avoiding any jerky movements. When changing lanes, I do it slowly and smoothly so that the passenger doesn't feel any sudden movements and perceives my driving as steady.

Speaker 1:
I understand. Do you think you have any bad driving habits that might make passengers uncomfortable?

Speaker 2:
Smoking, perhaps?

Speaker 1:
That counts, but it's not our main focus here.

Speaker 2:
Alright.

Speaker 1:
Because some people can tolerate smoke while others can't. But let's focus on your driving behavior. I think that's more relevant.

Speaker 2:
There might not be any major issues, just some minor details my dad might pick on.

Speaker 1:
What kind of things does your dad point out?

Speaker 2:
For instance, when I first started driving, he would comment on how I handled the steering wheel during turns.

Speaker 1:
Driving schools usually teach you to keep both hands on the wheel, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, but my dad would say that my hand movements shouldn't be as rigid as taught in driving school. He believes the way I grip the steering wheel should be correct and flexible. He also insists that I shouldn't drive with one hand and should always keep my hands at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions. He also advises against looking at my phone while driving. His main focus is on improving the passenger's experience, like not accelerating too harshly.

Speaker 1:
Does your dad comment on your acceleration?

Speaker 2:
Yes, he does. He says that when you press the gas pedal too hard, especially in a gasoline car, it takes time for the engine to respond, which can cause a sudden jolt. He advises against making passengers feel that sudden jerk and also against abrupt braking.

Speaker 1:
So, to avoid that sudden jolt, how do you press the gas pedal?

Speaker 2:
I start by pressing it lightly.

Speaker 1:
And then?

Speaker 2:
Once the car starts moving, I gradually press it more. This way, the car accelerates smoothly.

Speaker 1:
I see what you mean.

Speaker 2:
Yes, you start with a light press, and once the car begins to move, you can press the pedal more firmly for a smooth acceleration.

Speaker 1:
So, regardless of how hard you press the pedal initially, you ensure a smooth start.
Speaker 1:
So, you press the button, and the car starts moving. Then you give it some gas.

Speaker 2:
Yes, it doesn't matter if you press the pedal hard or just a little. When you start accelerating, it takes some time for the car to gradually pick up speed. So, it's better to press the pedal lightly.

Speaker 1:
Right, just a bit.

Speaker 2:
Yes, just a bit. The car's low-end torque will kick in.

Speaker 1:
Then you can press the pedal more to accelerate faster.

Speaker 2:
Exactly. If you press the pedal hard initially, the automatic transmission won't shift up immediately. It will hold a high RPM in the first gear, giving you a strong sense of acceleration. But if you press the pedal gently, the gear shifts smoothly without holding high RPMs, making the ride feel more stable and smooth. It's similar to how MPV brakes are designed to be less sensitive for a smoother passenger experience. The brake travel is longer, so it doesn't stop abruptly.

Speaker 1:
You mentioned the accelerator. What about the brakes? How can they be more comfortable?

Speaker 2:
Brake early and gradually. A linear and slow braking process is better. If you brake suddenly, the inertia will push people forward. As you approach a stop, slightly release the brake to counteract the inertia, allowing the car to stop smoothly.

Speaker 1:
So, you mean to press the brake gradually and deeply?

Speaker 2:
Yes, and then slowly release it.

Speaker 1:
Because if you press it deeply, the inertia will push the car forward.

Speaker 2:
Exactly, then you slightly release it.

Speaker 1:
And this process counteracts the force.

Speaker 2:
Yes, and then you can press the brake again to come to a complete stop. It's like a push-pull action.

Speaker 1:
And then push again.

Speaker 2:
Yes, this way, passengers won't feel the abrupt braking.

Speaker 1:
Is there anything else besides the accelerator and brakes?

Speaker 2:
It depends on what you're driving. If it's a manual transmission, you need to coordinate the clutch and throttle well. This isn't an issue with automatic transmissions, which makes them easier to handle.
Speaker 1:
What kind of car do you drive? If you drive a manual, your clutch control needs to be very good. With an automatic, you don't have to worry about that. So, with an automatic car, there's not much to discuss in terms of driving operations. But if you drive a manual...

Speaker 2:
Yes, the clutch control is crucial for gear selection. For example, if you're in 4th gear and approaching an intersection, when do you shift to neutral? Do you downshift gradually? If the gear and RPM don't match, the engine will struggle, and you'll hear that grinding noise. But if you shift to neutral at the right speed and RPM, there won't be much difference.

Speaker 1:
Right. With an automatic, apart from the gas pedal, brake, and steering wheel, do you pay attention to other things?

Speaker 2:
Not really, it's pretty straightforward. But my girlfriend, for instance, feels uneasy in the car. She always thinks she's not driving in the center of the lane because she's sitting on the left side. She constantly corrects her direction, which can be dangerous.

Speaker 1:
So, she tends to steer more to the right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, because of her perspective.

Speaker 1:
Right, she's closer to the left side, so she leaves more space on the left and thinks the right side is narrower.

Speaker 2:
Exactly, it's a personal issue. She doesn't have a good sense of the car's dimensions, which makes her driving less safe.

Speaker 1:
So, when others drive in a way that makes you uncomfortable, like your girlfriend, it bothers you?

Speaker 2:
Yes, it does. I feel her way of driving is not correct. She's just moving the car, but her chances of getting into an accident are higher.

Speaker 1:
Because she's not centered in the lane, she's closer to one side.

Speaker 2:
Even if she's not crossing the line, it's still dangerous.

Speaker 1:
Right, the unnecessary corrections can cause risks, especially at higher speeds.

Speaker 2:
Exactly, if you're driving at 80 or 100 km/h, even a slight movement of the steering wheel can be risky.
Speaker 1:
When you're driving, any unnecessary movements can create risks. If you don't constantly correct your steering, you might not notice it at lower speeds, but at 80 or 100 km/h, even a slight movement can make you change lanes. As an experienced driver, you probably understand this feeling. On the highway, the steering wheel is very sensitive.

Speaker 2:
Yes, on the highway, the steering wheel feels heavy. You can't just move it around carelessly. Constantly correcting your steering can be very dangerous. At 40 mph, it's not a big deal, but at 100 mph, it becomes a significant issue. When I first started learning to drive and got my license, I didn't think it was a problem. But my dad used to always point it out, and now I find myself saying the same things to my girlfriend.

Speaker 1:
When you're a passenger in someone else's car, what behaviors make you feel uncomfortable? I'm particularly interested in what makes you feel unsafe or anxious.

Speaker 2:
Sudden stops and starts make me feel nauseous.

Speaker 1:
Yes, sudden stops and starts can easily make you feel dizzy.

Speaker 2:
Exactly, that jerky feeling is very uncomfortable.

Speaker 1:
Anything else?

Speaker 2:
If the driver decides to drive aggressively and I'm not prepared, like if I'm playing on my phone, it can be uncomfortable. But I wouldn't say I'm scared because if I'm sitting in the front passenger seat, it means I trust their driving skills to some extent. However, if they drive recklessly...

Speaker 1:
How do you trust a ride-hailing driver?

Speaker 2:
I generally trust ride-hailing drivers because they've been driving for many years. The worst-case scenario is that they drive slowly, which can be frustrating if I'm in a hurry. I usually sit in the back right seat, which is considered the boss's seat. How they drive doesn't matter much to me unless it's a manual car. Ride-hailing drivers usually drive hybrid cars and aim to save fuel, so their driving is smooth. But if it's a manual car, it can be uncomfortable.

Speaker 1:
Like a taxi?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. If the driver isn't good at coordinating the clutch, you can feel every gear change. The start can be rough, and the gear shifts can be jerky.

Speaker 1:
Since you have passengers in your car today, are there any specific things you're paying extra attention to?

Speaker 2:
I'm not driving too fast.

Speaker 1:
You feel like you're driving more cautiously?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I'm not flooring the gas pedal to test the car's performance.
Speaker 1:
Do you think you were driving cautiously?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I wasn't trying to push the car to its limits or anything. There weren't any long straight stretches, except for that one section on the Fourth Ring Road and the service road. Other than that, there wasn't much opportunity for high-speed driving.

Speaker 1:
How did you feel about it? Does driving make you feel more comfortable? Any additional thoughts?

Speaker 2:
It helps reduce unnecessary movements. What I mean is...

Speaker 1:
I think I understand. It's like driving in a way where you make precise movements without constant adjustments, right? For example, not constantly accelerating and decelerating.

Speaker 2:
Exactly. For instance, if you're approaching a red light with three straight lanes and the left lane is empty, you might be tempted to switch to the left lane to be first. But if you have passengers, it's better to stay in your lane to avoid sudden movements that might make them uncomfortable.

Speaker 1:
So, the idea is to minimize actions to make the ride smoother for passengers. Because any action you take, the passengers will feel it. Reducing actions also reduces risk.

Speaker 2:
Right. If you stay in your lane, any collision would be the other driver's fault. But if you change lanes, you introduce risk. Staying in your lane is safer, while changing lanes can lead to problems if not done carefully. Understand?

Speaker 1:
Yes, and we also gave passengers a handle to press if they felt uncomfortable. We recorded that data. If you want to see it, I can show you after we finish the questions.

Speaker 2:
Sure, I'd like to see it. I think it would be objective since I don't know the passengers personally.
Speaker 1:
No problem, it's just about your personal willingness.

Speaker 2:
Sure, I can do that because I don't know them personally. So, I think they should be quite objective. But the premise is that the passengers shouldn't be too timid. If they are scared of riding in a car, then everyone has different standards for road conditions.

Speaker 1:
Yes, everyone has different requirements and standards for evaluation.

Speaker 2:
So, it's quite interesting.

Speaker 1:
The next few questions might require you to think a bit before answering. First, I want to ask, what do you think makes a good driver or a professional driver?

Speaker 2:
A good driver and a professional driver are two different things, right?

Speaker 1:
You think they are different, so you can explain what you think makes a good driver and what makes a professional driver.

Speaker 2:
If you are a professional driver, you consider more than just driving. You focus more on service. Your driving style is different because you are considering the experience of your passengers, like your boss or leader in the back seat. All your operations aim to make the ride as smooth as possible. You are not just aiming for a short commute time. A good driver, in my definition, is someone who can drive smoothly and safely on the road and be as efficient as possible. Many traffic jams are caused by cars that are too slow, which affects the entire road.

Speaker 1:
I understand. Your requirements for a good driver are somewhat similar to the requirements for a professional driver in services like Didi or luxury car services.

Speaker 2:
Yes, or luxury car services. Their functions are different, but they have common points. First, they must have rich driving experience. An experienced driver knows the road conditions well and can anticipate what might happen. So, they definitely have a lot of experience.

Speaker 1:
Got it. So, what do good drivers need to do well? What are the requirements for a good driver?

Speaker 2:
First, you must follow traffic rules. Then, your driving should be regulated and disciplined. For example, you must use turn signals where required.

Speaker 1:
Using turn signals is part of traffic rules.

Speaker 2:
Yes, and you must have a safety awareness.

Speaker 1:
Safety awareness is somewhat related to defensive driving, as you mentioned before.

Speaker 2:
Yes, when you approach an intersection, you should always have your foot on the brake, just like the traffic regulations state. When you pass through gates or similar places, your foot should be on the brake.

Speaker 1:
Let's talk about good drivers first.

Speaker 2:
Good drivers should not engage in road rage.

Speaker 1:
You mean emotional control.

Speaker 2:
Yes, you shouldn't engage in road rage. Don't think that someone merging into your lane is cutting you off and then try to cut them off in return. This kind of behavior is definitely not acceptable.
Speaker 2:
Yes, you shouldn't drive aggressively. Don't think that someone merging into your lane is trying to cut you off or challenge you. Just let them merge and continue driving normally. Avoid getting into a competition on the road.

Speaker 1:
Do you think that when you see a red light, you should stop immediately?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. You should drive normally and treat your car as a means of transportation. Drive it safely and efficiently. That's what I consider being a good driver. Another point is fuel efficiency. If you can drive your car more efficiently than others, that's a good sign. I remember hearing taxi drivers talk about how precise they are with their fuel usage. They know exactly how much pressure to apply on the gas pedal to maintain low fuel consumption.

Speaker 1:
They don't use extra power unnecessarily, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. For instance, when approaching a red light, they know how to coast to a stop without wasting fuel. Good drivers can manage their fuel consumption very efficiently.

Speaker 1:
What about professional drivers?

Speaker 2:
Professional drivers need to have a service-oriented mindset. It's more about providing a comfortable experience for their passengers.

Speaker 1:
Yes, or driving automatically, right? It's about the passengers' comfort.

Speaker 2:
Exactly. When driving a professional, you need to ensure a smooth ride. You can't frequently change lanes or drive aggressively if you have a boss in the back seat. The ride should be stable, and your acceleration and braking should be smooth. The goal is to make the passenger feel comfortable, as if the car is just gliding along.

Speaker 1:
What do you think is the biggest difference between experienced and novice drivers?

Speaker 2:
Probably the sense of the road.

Speaker 1:
The sense of the road?

Speaker 2:
Yes, the confidence in handling the road. Experienced drivers can predict the behavior of other vehicles better.

Speaker 1:
Is it about predicting the actions of other drivers?

Speaker 2:
Yes, novice drivers might panic in unexpected situations. They might not distinguish between the brake and the gas pedal. In a sudden situation, an experienced driver will react differently than a novice. Experienced drivers have encountered similar situations before and can handle them calmly. Novice drivers might panic and make sudden, unsafe maneuvers. The difference lies in the instinctive reactions and the ability to stay calm under pressure.
Speaker 1:
But if an experienced driver might have an instinctive reaction, they would check if there's any car theft happening. This could be the difference between two people. A new driver might be too scared to drive, feeling that driving is a burden.

Speaker 1:
The next question might be a bit difficult. In what ways do you think autonomous cars will never be able to match human drivers? Take your time to think about it.

Speaker 2:
We have some data on this.

Speaker 1:
Alright, you can take your time.

Speaker 2:
No worries, it's a bit tough, but it's okay.

Speaker 1:
You go ahead. We can wait, no problem. While waiting, we can finish this last stretch of the road. And you can think about the question slowly.

Speaker 2:
Thank you.

Speaker 2:
I think the one thing that autonomous cars can never replace is the sense of service that comes from human interaction. It's that feeling of being valued. Many people used to think that manual transmission cars were superior to automatic ones because you could control the RPM more precisely and drive faster. But in reality, modern cars with paddle shifters or computer assistance can handle it much better than a human. If the technology is mature enough, its ability to analyze and control road conditions will definitely surpass that of a human brain. Humans have emotions and can get distracted, but machines don't. However, the unique aspect is that if you're a boss, you might feel...

Speaker 1:
I paid someone to drive for me, and I enjoy that service.

Speaker 2:
Exactly. Even though an autonomous car can open the door for you, it can't provide that personal touch. When you're in the car, you enjoy the control and the interaction with the driver. It's like hiring someone to drive for you, and that feeling can't be replaced by autonomous driving.

Speaker 1:
So, in terms of driving, you think humans can't match autonomous driving?

Speaker 2:
If the technology is mature enough, it will definitely surpass human drivers. Right now, it might not be better than some skilled drivers, but once it reaches a certain level of maturity, autonomous cars will definitely outperform human drivers.

Speaker 1:
Got it. I have two more questions. One is, how do you judge the intentions of other pedestrians, non-motorized vehicles, and motor vehicles while driving? Let's start with pedestrians.

Speaker 2:
You can usually tell by looking at where they're looking when crossing the street.

Speaker 1:
Like that?

Speaker 2:
Yes, you can generally see which direction they intend to go.
Speaker 1:
When you're driving, can you observe which direction a pedestrian is looking? For example, when crossing the street?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. You can generally tell which direction they intend to go. Usually, when people are waiting to cross the street, it's rare to see just one person standing there. It's often a group, and you can observe the group's movements.

Speaker 1:
How do you observe the group's movements?

Speaker 2:
When the light turns green, you just need to watch if anyone starts moving. For instance, at an intersection, you should be aware of certain groups. I'm not trying to stereotype, but delivery riders often don't follow traffic rules. 

Speaker 1:
They might not be paying attention.

Speaker 2:
Right, they often don't follow traffic rules, so you need to keep an eye on them. If they're trying to beat the red light, it can be very dangerous. For regular pedestrians, if they're standing there looking at their phones, they probably won't cross the street, so you can proceed smoothly. Generally, people don't run red lights at major intersections, making it quite safe unless you're at an intersection without traffic lights.

Speaker 1:
What about intersections without traffic lights?

Speaker 2:
In that case, you need to observe the pedestrian's movements.

Speaker 1:
Where they're going, or their actions?

Speaker 2:
Exactly. If they're still shopping or doing something else, the cars will be faster. In such cases, you don't need to stop for them. But if they've already started crossing, you must let them go first. You can't make them step back.

Speaker 1:
What about non-motorized vehicles? You mentioned delivery riders earlier, but what about other situations involving non-motorized vehicles?

Speaker 2:
They're quite tricky and hard to predict. I remember a particularly dangerous situation at night on a city road where the speed limit is around 80 km/h. Motorcycles can be especially dangerous because their lights are small and not very visible. If you're changing lanes, they can suddenly appear in your blind spot. For example, if they're very close to you, there's an angle where you can't see them in your mirror. If they're at a certain distance, you can see their whole body in the mirror, but if they're too close...

Speaker 1:
Like if they're in your right rear blind spot?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. In that position, you can't see them in your mirror, which is very scary. Motorcycles are small and can be very dangerous. Ultimately, you need to drive carefully.

Speaker 1:
What about the intentions of other motor vehicles? You mentioned this briefly earlier.

Speaker 2:
You can observe, for example, the car in front of you...
Speaker 1: Ultimately, driving safely means being cautious.

Speaker 2: For example, if you're driving in your lane and there are two cars in the right lane, with the front car driving very slowly, the car behind might want to change lanes. You need to observe and give it space to change lanes. If it starts to move out a bit, it's definitely going to change lanes.

Speaker 1: Are there other scenarios?

Speaker 2: Another potentially dangerous situation is when cars are merging from a side road or trying to cut in. This tests your control over the car. If you don't want to let them in, you need to hold your position. Such situations usually arise from uncivilized driving. Civilized driving wouldn't have these issues.

Speaker 1: Let's go back to the scenario without traffic signals. How do you usually judge the intentions of pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles? Do you choose to yield or slowly inch forward and find an opportunity to pass quickly?

Speaker 2: If pedestrians are walking back and forth, you should let them pass first. You can't inch forward and expect them to yield to you. Cars should always yield to pedestrians, not the other way around.

Speaker 1: What about non-motorized vehicles?

Speaker 2: You should always yield to them as well. They can move quickly and won't yield to you.

Speaker 1: What if there's a situation where it's just one pedestrian and one car, and both of you are trying to cross the road at the same time? The pedestrian sees you and hesitates, and you also hesitate. What should you do?

Speaker 2: You should signal with your hand to let the pedestrian go first.

Speaker 1: Besides hand signals, are there other ways to handle this?

Speaker 2: You can stop the car by braking and not moving.

Speaker 1: So, brake and don't move.

Speaker 2: Yes, then signal with your hand to let the pedestrian go first.

Speaker 1: You wouldn't rush forward if the pedestrian hesitates, right?

Speaker 2: Right, if I've already signaled my intention to let them go, I will wait until they pass.

Speaker 1: That covers most of my questions. Do you have anything to add?

Speaker 2: We haven't talked about overtaking yet.

Speaker 1: Oh, right. Let's go back and discuss overtaking.
Speaker 2: Do you have anything to add?

Speaker 1: We haven't talked about overtaking yet.

Speaker 2: Oh, right. Let's go back and check. Oh, no, we haven't reached that part yet. We're almost there. So, what are your usual habits when overtaking?

Speaker 1: I always overtake from the left side. You can't overtake from the right.

Speaker 2: Yes, and?

Speaker 1: I always check the rearview mirror first.

Speaker 2: Yes, you need to check if there are any cars coming from behind in the lane you want to switch to. After checking the rear, you should also look ahead and observe the third lane to see if there are any cars there. If you don't check, you might end up colliding with another car that is also switching lanes. So, you need to be aware of both the front and the rear.

Speaker 1: When you say "observe the third lane," what do you mean?

Speaker 2: For example, if you're in the middle lane...

Speaker 1: Right, if you're in the middle lane and want to switch lanes.

Speaker 2: Yes, if I'm in the leftmost lane and want to switch to the right lane, I need to check if the car in the right lane also wants to switch to the same lane.

Speaker 1: In that case, you should wait. If you're in the leftmost lane and want to switch...

Speaker 2: If I want to overtake from the leftmost lane, I need to check if the car in the middle lane is also switching. If we both switch at the same time, we might collide.

Speaker 1: What if you're in the middle lane?

Speaker 2: If I want to overtake the car in front of me?

Speaker 1: Yes, if you want to overtake the car in front of you from the middle lane.

Speaker 2: I need to make sure the lane I want to switch to is clear.

Speaker 1: Exactly. You need to check if there are any cars in that lane. 

Speaker 2: Yes, if the car in front of me is not switching lanes, I still need to check. If the car in front is moving smoothly and there are no cars ahead, they won't switch lanes. Also, if there are no intersections, they won't turn off.

Speaker 1: So, you need to be aware of the surroundings.

Speaker 2: Yes, at that moment, I accelerated and switched lanes because there was a car behind me. 

Speaker 1: I didn't see that.

Speaker 2: It wasn't really overtaking. I didn't have the chance to overtake.

Speaker 1: Right, so there was no overtaking. I noticed you made a U-turn at the last intersection, which was quite busy with cars and pedestrians.

Speaker 2: What day is it today? Thursday, right? Yes, that's why I waited. Why didn't you go?

Speaker 1: I thought it was a left turn signal, not a U-turn signal, so I waited.

Speaker 2: I thought it was a left turn signal, not a U-turn signal. Later, someone told me I could go, so I went.

Speaker 1: Who told you?
Speaker 1: The left turn signal is on, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, I thought making a left turn wouldn't count as a U-turn. So, when he told me I could go, I proceeded.

Speaker 1: Who told you that you could go? Was it the person behind you? Also, do you have Excel on your computer? I didn't expect this. Sorry, never mind. Do you have Excel on your computer?

Speaker 2: Yes, I do. I can give it to you now. Here you go. Hurry up, I need my computer back. 

Speaker 1: Alright, I'll close this first, and then we can look at the data.

Speaker 1: No worries, there's another computer here. Can you check if it can charge your computer?

Speaker 2: I'll try. Both are Lenovo. It should work.

Speaker 1: Why isn't it showing that it's charging? Maybe the voltage is different. It's probably your adapter.

Speaker 2: I understand what you mean.

Speaker 1: You left the meeting. The recording won't stop, right? Let me check. Can you rejoin the meeting?

Speaker 1: How do I do this? What did you say? Do I need to split the screen first?

Speaker 2: Oh, the split screen is here.

Speaker 1: I see. Where?

Speaker 2: I don't know, don't move. Isn't it the same here?

Speaker 1: Isn't this faster?

Speaker 1: Okay, you can either share your screen or give me the data directly.

Speaker 2: I'll share my screen.

Speaker 1: Alright, then give it to me. What's the situation?

Speaker 2: You handle it.

Speaker 1: Okay, look at this. All the non-zero data points indicate that passengers were pressing the handle. The times are concentrated around 18:28:28, 18:28:35, and 18:28:47.

Speaker 2: Hurry up, I need it.

Speaker 1: What time was that? And where were we at that time?

Speaker 2: I can stop sharing. There's no need to share, you have the data.

Speaker 1: Right, we can just note the times. Which map are you referring to? Did you note the times? 18:28:41, right? You should share your screen, and I'll just tell you the times.

Speaker 2: The recording started at 16:00, but I'm not sure about the exact seconds. 

Speaker 1: At 16:00, the video shows 18:28:35 and 18:28:47, which are basically the same place.

Speaker 2: Yes, since there are no seconds, the transition might be significant. Just check the entire 16:00 minute mark.

Speaker 1: So, starting from 16:00, where do you think he might have felt uncomfortable?

Speaker 2: I started accelerating at that point.

Speaker 1: Maybe he was in a hurry to get back.

Speaker 2: No, the road ahead was a long straight, and I was driving very slowly. There was no acceleration.

Speaker 1: Oh, so you remember it clearly.
Speaker 1:
Look, there's a long straight road ahead, and everyone is driving really slowly. No one is accelerating; they're just maintaining a slow pace.

Speaker 2:
Oh, so you remember it clearly. After the red light, you started to accelerate, right?

Speaker 1:
Yes, the car pulled over to the side for a moment.

Speaker 2:
I noticed that, and then...

Speaker 1:
After the two cars behind overtook it, there was no one in front of me.

Speaker 2:
So, I started to pull over, and then you accelerated. It wasn't a sudden acceleration, just a gradual increase.

Speaker 1:
I wanted to test how the car performed. The speedometer showed 60, then quickly 80. What happened next?

Speaker 2:
The passenger clearly felt it.

Speaker 1:
Yes, they probably felt it but didn't say anything. I said I was going to speed up, so I pressed the gas pedal. At the next intersection, the speed was over 40.

Speaker 2:
Did you accelerate again after turning?

Speaker 1:
Yes, I did.

Speaker 2:
I wanted to overtake, so I accelerated.

Speaker 1:
Let's look at another time. Can you tell me?

Speaker 2:
16:10, or maybe 5 minutes.

Speaker 1:
19:10.

Speaker 2:
So, around 8 minutes, or 8 and a half minutes. Start watching from 8 and a half minutes. Yes, from 8:30.

Speaker 1:
Not 8:30, it's 4:10. Yes, 8:30. Were you adjusting the mirror then? Yes, during the official test, I adjusted it.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I mentioned earlier that after turning right, I couldn't see the right side clearly, so I felt uneasy. I discussed it while driving.

Speaker 1:
This was during the official test, not the test drive. Are there other times? Actually, it's 9 minutes. He kept looking. Yes, around 9 minutes, 8:30, he might have been making a U-turn.

Speaker 2:
Yes, it was during the reversing part.

Speaker 1:
The car kept beeping. Yes, it was around 9 minutes.

Speaker 2:
Was it during the official test?

Speaker 1:
I remember you were making a U-turn, and the beeping was very loud. Before the U-turn, you followed closely, and then it beeped loudly.

Speaker 2:
The passenger mentioned that the radar sound was loud.

Speaker 1:
I'll turn up the volume to listen.

Speaker 1:
I understand. OK, next. Let's check the radar. Next time. Hmm, 02. 16:42. So, I'll start from 14 minutes.
Speaker 1:
"Turn up the volume, let me listen."

Speaker 2:
"I understand. OK, next. Let's do this radar. Alright, next time. Hmm, it's 02:16:42. Yes, I'll set it to 14 minutes on my end."

Speaker 1:
"Not here."

Speaker 2:
"In the video, it's 16:42."

Speaker 1:
"16 and a half minutes."

Speaker 2:
"Just start watching from there. It's around the same time he accelerated earlier. Basically the same time. After that, you also increased the speed, right? At least to 60. Yes, that's it. It's quite normal on this road."

Speaker 1:
"Yes, because at the beginning, everyone was driving too slowly. You know, there was a stretch where we were all going at 40 mph. The car didn't have any noticeable feedback, it was just swaying a bit. And since the car in front was electric, it felt even less noticeable."

Speaker 2:
"Alright, I understand. Are there any other times? No? Okay, so it's just your follow-up questions. After that, you also noticed it yourself, right? Yes, we've seen everything we needed to see. Alright, then the interview is over. Okay, then."
