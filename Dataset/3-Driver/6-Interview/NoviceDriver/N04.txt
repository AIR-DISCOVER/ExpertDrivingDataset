**Interviewer:**
12345678, why don't you handle that?

**Interviewer:**
Hey, I brought you another bottle of water. OK, OK, OK.

**Interviewee:**
You can just speak.

**Interviewer:**
So, we just recorded your eye movements. This device tracks where you are looking while driving. Alright, let's move to the part before you started driving.

**Interviewer:**
Have you finished eating? If so, we can start soon. There were a few minor issues, but everything should be fine now. Let's begin the interview formally. First, let me introduce myself. I will be conducting the final interview for your driving experiment today. We will watch the video recorded during the experiment, which shows your eye movements. The red dot indicates your focus point. We will explore your driving habits through this video. Feel free to pause and discuss any interesting points. Don't worry, there are no wrong answers. Just relax and speak as if we are having a casual conversation. I will ask you some questions, and you can answer honestly. If there are any questions you are uncomfortable with, just let me know, and you don't have to answer. Lastly, I want to emphasize that all collected data will be anonymized and will not infringe on your privacy. If there are no other questions, let's start with some simple ones. What vehicles have you driven before this experiment?

**Interviewee:**
Before the experiment, I have driven an Audi Q5, a Mercedes E-Class, and a Toyota Prado. I have also driven various other cars like Nissan and X-Trail.

**Interviewer:**
So, you've driven a variety of vehicles, including SUVs and sedans. Have you driven any new energy or hybrid electric vehicles?

**Interviewee:**
Yes, I have test-driven some electric vehicles from NIO, but only test drives. I don't have many electric vehicles around me, so I haven't driven them much.

**Interviewer:**
Among the cars you've driven, do any of them have...
Speaker 1: Have you driven any cars with advanced driver assistance systems?

Speaker 2: Yes, I have. For example, features like cruise control, automatic start-stop, and automatic parking. I can share a few memorable experiences.

Speaker 1: Please do.

Speaker 2: My mom's E-Class E300 has an automatic parking feature. However, since it's a 2019 model, the system isn't perfect. It sometimes struggles to recognize parking spaces, making it a bit cumbersome. But when it does work, it parks quite well.

Speaker 2: In China, though, this feature isn't very practical in crowded parking lots, like those in shopping malls. It tends to be slower than manual parking. I've also driven newer electric vehicles from brands like NIO and Li Auto, which have more advanced Level 2 autonomous driving features. These systems allow you to take your hands off the wheel on highways, as they can recognize and follow the road.

Speaker 1: So, they have lane-keeping functions?

Speaker 2: Yes, but it's more than just lane-keeping. These intelligent driving aids let you relax and focus on the road ahead. Initially, you might feel a bit anxious, not fully trusting the cameras and sensors, but these systems are quite reliable now.

Speaker 1: Can you give another example of a feature you've used?

Speaker 2: Besides automatic parking, there's lane-keeping assistance.

Speaker 1: Which car had that feature?

Speaker 2: Both NIO and Li Auto vehicles have intelligent driving aids, including lane-keeping assistance.

Speaker 1: How did you find using these features?

Speaker 2: I found them quite effective. For instance, while driving on an elevated highway, if a car suddenly appears in front of you, the system can automatically avoid it. Another useful feature is automatic emergency braking, which is common in brands like Volvo. I remember once I was a bit distracted while driving, and the car automatically braked to prevent an accident.
**Speaker 1:**
So, how do you feel about the driving assistance features?

**Speaker 2:**
I think they are quite helpful. There was one time when I was driving and got a bit distracted. I didn't notice the car in front of me until I was very close. The system alerted me just in time, preventing a potential accident. This feature is really useful as it helps reduce such incidents.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you find these features beneficial overall?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, definitely. They are not overwhelmingly intrusive but certainly helpful.

**Speaker 1:**
Which feature do you use the most?

**Speaker 2:**
Actually, I don't use them very often. Our family car is quite traditional and doesn't have many of these new technologies. I mostly drive that car.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you usually drive short distances in the city or longer trips?

**Speaker 2:**
Mostly short distances, around ten kilometers or so. But when we go on trips, we do drive longer distances.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you find driving our vehicle today? Were there any features that you found difficult to adapt to?

**Speaker 2:**
I found the car quite good. It's a Lincoln hybrid model, a 2.0 hybrid. However, the transition between the electric motor and the gasoline engine isn't as smooth as some Japanese cars. I also noticed that the fuel consumption is quite high. The display showed 12.5 liters per 100 kilometers, which is higher than I expected. Normally, hybrids should consume around 4 to 5 liters per 100 kilometers.

**Speaker 2:**
But other than that, the car has some great features like ventilated seats, heated seats, and massage functions. One thing that stood out to me was the sensitivity of the radar system. When I was making a U-turn, the radar was overly sensitive and alerted me even when there were no cars nearby. This made me a bit anxious, thinking there was a car behind me when there wasn't.

**Speaker 1:**
So, overall, how do you feel about the car?

**Speaker 2:**
Overall, I think it's a good car, but the overly sensitive radar can be a bit troublesome. Other than that, the comfort features are excellent.
Speaker 1:
How do you feel about the distance?

Speaker 2:
I think it's still quite far. So, this might be a bit troublesome for you, but otherwise, I feel the car rides well.

Speaker 1:
So, your driving hasn't been affected?

Speaker 2:
No, I don't think it has been affected. It's still pretty good.

Speaker 1:
Alright, the next question might be a bit sensitive. Have you ever been involved in a traffic accident?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I have been involved in traffic accidents.

Speaker 1:
Could you tell me about them?

Speaker 2:
They were all minor accidents. For example, once I was on a roundabout, driving very slowly because there was a traffic light. The lane markings on the roundabout were very faint. There was a large bus behind me, and it seemed like the bus driver wanted to merge into my lane. I got nervous and stopped, but the bus couldn't brake in time and hit my car.

Speaker 2:
When I braked, the lane markings were really faint. The bus driver was driving normally, but if we had gone to the police or traffic management to determine responsibility, it would have been too troublesome. So, we just went through insurance to settle it.

Speaker 2:
Another incident was when I was driving my dad's Audi, which is a 2013 model without many driving assistance features, just a cruise control. One night, around 9 or 10 PM, it was very dark, and I was moving the car. There was a large truck behind me, which made it very difficult. I accidentally hit a tree while trying to move the car out of a parking spot at a restaurant. The tree got slightly damaged, but nothing major happened.

Speaker 1:
I see. Have these accidents affected your driving? Do you pay extra attention now?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I do pay more attention now. I used to drive much faster and more aggressively. Now, I start more slowly and drive more cautiously. I always check my mirrors before changing lanes or turning to avoid accidents. On roundabouts, I make sure to follow the lane markings and traffic rules to prevent accidents.

Speaker 1:
Alright, let's review the footage from your recent driving experiment.
Speaker 1:
We need to follow traffic rules to avoid accidents.

Speaker 1:
Let's review the video of your recent driving test. I'll ask you about your usual driving habits in specific scenarios, and then we'll compare them with the video to see if they match.

Speaker 2:
Sure, sounds good.

Speaker 1:
After leaving the parking lot, the first scenario is a right turn into a service road. Can you explain your usual approach to making a turn?

Speaker 2:
When making a right turn, I first check the service road. I look to the left to see if any cars are coming. If there are no cars, I signal and then make the right turn, merging into the service road.

Speaker 1:
So, your focus is on checking for oncoming traffic from the left before turning right. What do you look for on the right side?

Speaker 2:
On the right, I check the road for any obstacles or non-motorized vehicles. I also monitor my car's speed and dynamics to ensure there are no sudden changes. I occasionally glance at the speedometer and other indicators.

Speaker 1:
Got it. Now, let's move to the next scenario where you merge from a main road to another main road. How do you handle situations with oncoming non-motorized vehicles?

Speaker 2:
I usually give way to non-motorized vehicles. It's important to avoid accidents, even if they are not following the rules. I try to prevent any potential collisions by being cautious.

Speaker 1:
Understood. Let's rewind a bit. When you checked your rearview mirror earlier, what were you looking for?

Speaker 2:
I have a habit of frequently checking my rearview mirror to see if there are any cars approaching from behind.

Speaker 1:
Alright, I can rewind the video a bit more. You mentioned checking the rearview mirror about 200 meters before merging. What were you confirming?

Speaker 2:
I was just making sure there were no cars coming from behind, as it's a habit of mine to stay aware of my surroundings.
Speaker 2:
I have a habit of glancing at my rearview mirror from time to time, not necessarily to check for cars, but just out of habit, especially with so many delivery vehicles around these days.

Speaker 1:
Do you also check the right mirror?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I do. I check all the mirrors periodically. It's just a habit I can't really explain.

Speaker 1:
That's okay, no need to be nervous. Not everything needs a reason.

Speaker 2:
Exactly, there's no specific reason for it.

Speaker 1:
How do you maintain a safe distance from oncoming traffic on your left?

Speaker 2:
It's really about experience and instinct. When you're driving, you develop a sense for it. You might glance at the rearview mirror, and your eyes will naturally check the side mirrors too. It's almost automatic.

Speaker 1:
Alright, let's talk about how you usually merge onto a main road. Can you describe your typical process?

Speaker 2:
I usually start by checking the rearview mirror. If there are no cars, I proceed to merge.

Speaker 1:
Can you provide more details?

Speaker 2:
Sure, I first check the left rearview mirror, then look over my shoulder to ensure there's no traffic. If it's clear, I merge onto the main road.

Speaker 1:
What about the steering wheel, accelerator, and brake?

Speaker 2:
I slow down and keep my foot on the brake. I slightly steer to the left while merging. My foot stays on the brake because it's a transition from a side road to a main road.

Speaker 1:
When you merge onto the main road, can you describe your actions in detail, including how you observe and operate the vehicle?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I start by checking the rearview mirror. I can't see the greenbelt area directly, but I instinctively want to check it. As I prepare to merge, I ensure there are no cars behind me. If a car appears in my blind spot, like the white car did, I react by braking to avoid a collision.
Speaker 2:
It's a visual blind spot; the video doesn't capture it at all. Yes, when I merged and saw the white car, I braked. If I had let the white car pass first, it would have been better. It was in a visual blind spot, and it never appeared in the video.

Speaker 1:
So at that moment, you didn't notice it either?

Speaker 2:
No, I didn't notice it. I wasn't paying attention to the white car.

Speaker 1:
So when it appeared, how did you react? It was very close, maybe half a meter from the front of your car.

Speaker 2:
I would brake and let it pass first because, according to the rules, it had the right of way, and I was merging. I had to let it pass before I could go.

Speaker 1:
10 minutes and 39 seconds. Okay.

Speaker 1:
Here, we can see that because you were blocked, the buffer zone was gone when you turned into this lane. In such a situation, would you make a sharp turn?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I would make a sharp turn to get in.

Speaker 1:
I see. You should have braked for the white car, right?

Speaker 2:
No, I didn't brake because I judged that based on its speed and mine, I could pass without stopping. So, I didn't brake.

Speaker 1:
300 meters to the next point. And here...

Speaker 2:
Get ready to turn around because there's a U-turn ahead.

Speaker 1:
This is a section with good road conditions, mostly straight. Can you describe your usual driving habits on such roads?

Speaker 2:
My driving habits are a bit different today because I just got this car and I'm curious about its performance. I might accelerate more or test its straight-line driving. In a city like this, you can't drive too fast because of the complex road conditions. In my hometown, Dalian, there are no non-motorized vehicles allowed on the road, so you don't have to worry about them. When the road conditions are complex, you can't drive too slowly; you need to keep a safe distance from the car in front and pass through.

Speaker 1:
Arriving at the next point. On such roads, what speed do you usually maintain?

Speaker 2:
On this road, I would maintain around 40 to 60 km/h. If there aren't many cars ahead, I might go 60 to 80 km/h. In foggy conditions, I would keep it around 60 km/h.

Speaker 1:
At 60 km/h, what is your usual following distance?

Speaker 2:
I usually keep a shorter following distance in the city.
**Speaker 1:**
At a speed of 60 km/h, what is your usual following distance?

**Speaker 2:**
I usually keep a shorter following distance in the city because the speed is just 60 km/h. I feel confident that I can stop in time if needed. I don't measure the exact distance, but I tend to follow a bit closer than recommended.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright. Let's show everyone this video where you are following the car in front. We can analyze the distance you usually maintain and compare it to your typical habit. Let me know your thoughts.

**Speaker 2:**
Sure. As we approach the main road near the classic landmark, I usually follow a bit closer than this. Right now, the car in front is about to make a U-turn, so I’m keeping a bit more distance. Normally, I would stop with my car's front near the ambulance, but since the car ahead is turning, I’m driving more cautiously. It also depends on my mindset and urgency. Today, I have two passengers, so I need to ensure their safety. Sudden acceleration and braking can make passengers feel dizzy, so I’m driving more smoothly today.

**Speaker 1:**
I understand. So, you’re maintaining a greater distance and not accelerating too much.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I’m not pushing the speed. The following distance is about one car length.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you describe your usual U-turn habits? I can move back a bit to give you more space.

**Speaker 2:**
I’m not very comfortable with U-turns because traffic rules vary. During my first test drive, I was hesitant, especially at red lights. I prefer to make U-turns when there are no cars on the right or left. I slow down, check the rearview mirror, and then make the turn. On roads like this, I might need to reverse a bit to complete the turn. Today, the traffic is light, and there’s a red light, making the U-turn easier.

**Speaker 1:**
I see you’re preparing to enter the main road at the traffic light.
Speaker 1: It seems like there was a red light, so making a U-turn was very convenient. After that, at the traffic light intersection, you entered the main road. I noticed that before you started reversing, your left hand was always on top of the steering wheel, indicating that you were slightly steering to the right. For example, when you were driving straight, I observed that you habitually kept to the left.

Speaker 2: Yes, I tend to keep to the left. I might not be aware of it, but you noticed it.

Speaker 1: Exactly, because I was aware of it. It was quite obvious that the left edge line was almost under the left wheel. If this car's white line is at the window position, it means we are close to the white line. It’s clear that you knew you had to make a U-turn ahead. Here, your left hand pushed the steering wheel, and the car's front slowly moved in. You can see the drainage distance increasing.

Speaker 2: I'm not entirely sure why I did that. Maybe I felt that turning the wheel all the way wouldn't be enough, so I slightly moved to the right to create more space for the U-turn. Even though it might not be enough, it would make the turn easier.

Speaker 1: I understand.

Speaker 2: This is about the car radar. I don't understand why the radar was beeping at that point.

Speaker 1: It might be because of the car door on this side.

Speaker 2: Yes, but I felt it was unclear why it was beeping.

Speaker 1: Can I ask, when you were reversing, where were you specifically looking? It seemed a bit erratic.

Speaker 2: Yes, you have to look back and forth. You need to check the road conditions in front of you and behind you.

Speaker 1: So, your eyes were mainly on the front, then after turning, you checked the left side mirror, and then glanced at the right side mirror. Is that correct?

Speaker 2: Yes, that's my habit. I first look back to see if there is space for reversing. If there are no cars behind, I check the space in front to ensure it's enough for moving forward. It's an instinctive action; I keep looking back and forth to confirm.

Speaker 1: I understand.

Speaker 2: If everything is clear, I proceed without hesitation.

Speaker 1: Alright, after completing the U-turn...
**Speaker 1:**
Alright, yes, you need to confirm back and forth.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
So, if there are no issues, you can proceed without hesitation.

**Speaker 2:**
Right. After we finish adjusting the map, there will be a phase where we accelerate. When reversing, the speed is naturally very slow. Can you tell me about your driving habits during this gradual acceleration process?

**Speaker 1:**
Sure, my driving habit is to accelerate as quickly as possible. It's a personal preference; I like the feeling of speeding up quickly, but always within safe limits.

**Speaker 2:**
I see. Now, let's talk about lane changing and overtaking. Can you describe your usual driving habits for these maneuvers?

**Speaker 1:**
Honestly, my driving habits might not be the best. Sometimes, if the car behind is far away or there are no cars, I might not signal when changing lanes. But if there are many cars or it's a traffic jam, I will signal and check for space before changing lanes.

**Speaker 2:**
Lane changing is relatively easy under normal conditions, but it can be tricky in heavy traffic, especially when you need to change lanes to exit. Sometimes, you have to change lanes well in advance, which can be quite challenging.

**Speaker 1:**
What about overtaking? You mainly talked about lane changing.

**Speaker 2:**
For overtaking, especially in traffic jams, I usually follow the traffic rules and my habits. I prefer to overtake quickly and then return to my original lane.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you be more specific? For example, what do you observe before overtaking? What actions do you take during the overtaking process? And how do you return to your original lane or decide to stay in the left lane?

**Speaker 2:**
It depends on the situation. If the car in front is slow and I need to turn right soon, I might overtake it and then return to the right lane to prepare for the turn. I always observe the speed and position of other cars before making any move.
Speaker 1:
So, you decided to follow the car in front, but then you wanted to drive a bit faster, so you overtook it and moved back to the right lane, preparing to turn right. When overtaking, you need to accelerate because you can't overtake slowly. If you go at the same speed as the car you're overtaking, you won't be able to complete the maneuver. You have to press the accelerator firmly to increase the car's RPM and speed up. After overtaking, you move back to the right lane. But before overtaking, you must check the left and right mirrors. For example, if you're overtaking on the left, you need to check the left mirror to see if there's any car behind you. If the distance is safe, you can steer to the left.

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. You need to observe the left side.

Speaker 1:
Why did you press the horn?

Speaker 2:
I pressed the horn to alert the other driver, to prevent them from speeding up while I was overtaking. It's a precautionary measure.

Speaker 1:
Because the road ahead was blocked, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I had to change lanes.

Speaker 1:
So, you alerted the other driver.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I moved to the left lane and then prepared to turn right. At that moment, I didn't check the right mirror because I knew the right lane was blocked, so there wouldn't be any cars coming from behind. I signaled and then turned right.

Speaker 1:
You checked the right mirror and then turned, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I checked the right mirror to ensure there were no cars. Then I turned right.

Speaker 1:
In this situation, you were observing the distance between your car and the other car, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I was scanning back and forth with my eyes to judge the distance.

Speaker 1:
So, you were judging the distance to ensure your right wheel was in the middle of the lane, right?

Speaker 2:
I wasn't specifically looking at the right wheel. By checking the mirrors, I could gauge the distance between my car and the other car.
**Speaker 1:**
I was observing the trajectory of the right wheel at dawn.

**Speaker 2:**
I wasn't really looking at the right wheel. By checking the side mirror, I can gauge the distance from the car next to me. This way, I know how far it is from me. It's a simple habit that reveals a lot. As we approach the waypoint, do you think I should use the navigation?

**Speaker 1:**
That's because we're near the waypoint. At the traffic light earlier, I quickly glanced at the right rear.

**Speaker 1:**
This radar system seems overly sensitive.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the radar is too sensitive.

**Speaker 1:**
Were you trying to adjust it at that time? I noticed you were adjusting something earlier. Was it the radar?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I was adjusting it earlier. 

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, let me ask you some other questions. For instance, to ensure safety during this drive, were there any specific areas you paid extra attention to?

**Speaker 2:**
To ensure driving safety, the first thing I do is reduce speed. Secondly, I pay attention to the passenger on my right. I have a habit of checking on my passengers, especially if they might feel car sick. I monitor their condition to adjust my driving accordingly. For instance, I try to brake smoothly rather than abruptly, to avoid sudden stops that could jolt the car. I also keep an eye on non-motorized vehicles to avoid collisions and ensure everyone's safety.

**Speaker 1:**
Besides these areas, is there anything else you focus on for safety? You mentioned making the passenger more comfortable.

**Speaker 2:**
For safety, the primary thing is to reduce speed. Secondly, I frequently observe delivery bikes and non-motorized vehicles, as well as other incoming traffic. By not rushing and driving calmly, the likelihood of accidents decreases. The faster you try to go, the higher the risk of accidents. So, maintaining a calm mindset while driving helps reduce the chances of accidents.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think can make driving even safer? Based on your experience today, is there anything additional you could do?

**Speaker 2:**
I believe what I'm already doing ensures safety. There's not much more to add. Driving safety also depends on your experience and the number of years you've been driving.
Speaker 1: Once safety is ensured, is there anything else you focus on? I think driving experience, how often you drive, and your level of nervousness all play a role. It's a comprehensive consideration, and I'm not sure how to answer this question exactly.

Speaker 2: I think everything is fine. There's nothing specific that I missed.

Speaker 1: Alright, let's continue by watching a video. How did you judge whether the non-motorized vehicle would cut in front of you or yield to you?

Speaker 2: I usually assume they will yield to me.

Speaker 1: The vehicle moved forward a bit, looked at you, and then stopped.

Speaker 2: Yes, I think it wouldn't cut in front of me because I was driving normally. Its turn was illegal since it should have waited at the pedestrian crossing for the green light. So, I assumed it would yield, but I also kept an eye on its movements.

Speaker 1: How did you determine it would yield to you?

Speaker 2: I watched its movements. If it tried to overtake me, I would stop. If it stayed behind, I would continue driving. It's a dynamic assessment.

Speaker 1: From the video, it looks like you steered left to go around it.

Speaker 2: Yes, I watched its movements. If it moved forward, I would have taken action.

Speaker 1: So, you would have taken action if it moved forward. You then turned right into Zhongguancun.

Speaker 2: Yes, I saw the non-motorized vehicle. 400 meters later, I reached my destination. The non-motorized vehicle blocked my path, so I had to maneuver around it. I checked my left front side and saw a car, but it was far enough away. So, I quickly moved left, then right again, as the lane had a broken yellow line, which allowed me to cross safely.

Speaker 1: Let's continue with the video and some more questions. Can you recall any specific driving experiences or road conditions?
Speaker 1: Shall we continue, or would you like me to ask you some other questions? OK, please recall some of your previous driving experiences. Were there any particular situations, road conditions, or traffic scenarios that made you especially fearful?

Speaker 2: Yes, there was a situation that made me particularly scared. For example, I was on a bridge, not on a side road, but on the main road of the bridge. I was on the ramp leading to the main bridge, and I needed to merge from the ramp onto the main bridge.

Speaker 1: So, you needed to merge from the side road onto the main road.

Speaker 2: Yes, exactly. But the bridge only had two lanes. Suddenly, there was a water truck in front of me, watering the plants on the bridge. The truck was stopped, and the traffic on the right lane was moving very fast. I couldn't move forward because the truck was blocking the way. I had to steer to the right to go around the water truck, but the cars on the right were moving very quickly, and no one was willing to let me in. I was extremely scared at that moment. When I tried to move to the right, the cars behind me wouldn't give way at all.

Speaker 1: Was the water truck also trying to get onto the bridge?

Speaker 2: No, it was a maintenance truck, watering the plants on the bridge. There are flower baskets every few meters along the bridge, and the truck was watering them. This situation made me very nervous because I couldn't move to the right.

Speaker 1: Why didn't you just follow the truck?

Speaker 2: The truck was moving very slowly, stopping every 5 meters. It was impossible to follow it closely.

Speaker 1: I understand. So, the right lane was a straight side road, and you needed to merge onto the main bridge.

Speaker 2: Yes, exactly. There were only two lanes, and I needed to merge onto the main bridge. It was very stressful.

Speaker 1: So, if I understand correctly, there was a large vehicle in front of you moving slowly, blocking your view. You had to change lanes to go around it, but the traffic on the right was moving very fast, making it difficult to merge.

Speaker 2: Yes, and the traffic volume was very high.

Speaker 1: I see. So, there was a large vehicle blocking your way, and you needed to change lanes to pass it, but the conditions on both sides were not favorable for merging. Were there any other situations?

Speaker 2: Other than that, it was mostly just dealing with traffic jams.
Speaker 1: Are there any other situations you encountered?

Speaker 2: Well, other than that, it's generally okay. But there are some specific situations, like when you're stuck in traffic and need to change lanes to the right. For example, you're in a traffic jam, but you need to move to the right lane. In such cases, you have to maneuver carefully. Or, if you're stuck in traffic and want to make a left turn at a traffic light, but only the leftmost lane allows left turns, you need to move to the left lane. How do you manage that?

Speaker 1: Other drivers might not let you in, right?

Speaker 2: Exactly, they might not let you in. So, you have to inch your way in, which can be stressful. 

Speaker 1: It's like you have to cut in line.

Speaker 2: Yes, exactly, cutting in line.

Speaker 1: In Beijing, it's rare for people to let you cut in.

Speaker 2: Everyone follows closely. Another situation is when you're on a four-lane road with two left-turn lanes. The first left-turn lane is only for left turns, while the second left-turn lane allows both left turns and straight driving. The traffic on the right lanes is heavy, but you want to go straight. If the car in front of you is turning left, what should you do? This can be tricky to handle.

Speaker 1: You either wait or change lanes.

Speaker 2: Yes, but with heavy traffic on the right, it's challenging.

Speaker 1: So, you end up changing lanes.

Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.

Speaker 1: Got it. Let's talk about making a left turn at an intersection. You mentioned your habits for right turns earlier. Can you explain your approach to left turns?

Speaker 2: It's similar. I first check the left side mirror to ensure there are no cars.

Speaker 1: So, you check the left side mirror before turning left?

Speaker 2: Yes, I check the left side mirror. For left turns, I also check the right side window to see if there are any cars coming from the right. If there are no cars, I proceed with the left turn.

Speaker 1: Why do you check the right side window?

Speaker 2: I might have forgotten to check the right side mirror, or maybe there were no cars on the right.

Speaker 1: Yes, it could be that there were no cars on the right.

Speaker 2: Exactly.

Speaker 1: So, you check the left side mirror and then proceed with the turn.

Speaker 2: Yes, if there are no cars around, I just go ahead without checking the right side mirror.

Speaker 1: What if there are many parked cars on the side of the road, blocking your way, and you need to move to the left lane?

Speaker 2: In that case, I would carefully maneuver to the left lane to avoid the parked cars.
**Interviewer:** When you encounter a situation where many vehicles are parked on the roadside, blocking your lane, and you need to borrow the left lane, how do you handle such a complex road condition?

**Interviewee:** I would move to the left. Yes, I would move to the left in such a situation.

**Interviewer:** Could you be more specific about how you handle this?

**Interviewee:** I would maneuver around the parked cars while ensuring safety, similar to how a taxi driver would handle it. The key is to maintain a safe distance and proceed cautiously.

**Interviewer:** How do you ensure the distance between your car and the vehicle on your left?

**Interviewee:** I use the side mirrors to check the distance. Additionally, there's a guideline that when you're driving, your left foot should be aligned with the left wheel, which helps in maintaining the correct distance.

**Interviewer:** So, you judge the distance based on that?

**Interviewee:** Yes, I judge the distance based on that guideline.

**Interviewer:** What if there's an intersection ahead and you need to turn left?

**Interviewee:** If there are cars at the intersection, I would wait for a safe gap before turning left. After the intersection, I would continue to monitor for bicycles or other obstacles and proceed accordingly.

**Interviewer:** Do you have any driving habits that you think might be unsafe?

**Interviewee:** I think I tend to drive a bit fast and accelerate quickly, which can be dangerous. Apart from that, I feel relatively safe. However, I do get a bit nervous when navigating roundabouts, especially when exiting, which could potentially lead to accidents. Traffic congestion also makes me anxious, but otherwise, I think my driving habits are fine.

**Interviewer:** So, no other major issues with your driving habits?

**Interviewee:** No, not really. I think my driving is generally safe.

**Interviewer:** When you're a passenger, what driving behaviors from others make you feel unsafe or nervous?

**Interviewee:** I think sudden acceleration and deceleration are the main issues. As a driver, you might not feel it as much, but as a passenger, especially in the front seat, it can be quite uncomfortable and make you feel unsafe.

**Interviewer:** So, when you're a passenger, sudden changes in speed make you uncomfortable?

**Interviewee:** Yes, exactly. Sudden acceleration and deceleration make me feel uneasy when I'm not the one driving.
**Speaker 1:**
How do you feel when someone else is driving, and you're in the passenger seat or the back seat? Do you ever feel uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, for example, when driving on certain roads...

**Speaker 1:**
I often feel unsafe in such situations.

**Speaker 2:**
There was this one time when I went to Henan for a trip. I was sitting in the back seat of a taxi, and the driver was going extremely fast. He was driving at 100 km/h in the city, weaving in and out of traffic without using turn signals. It was terrifying. The speed was incredibly high, especially in areas with few cars. It felt very dangerous with sudden accelerations and decelerations, making the whole experience quite unsettling.

**Speaker 1:**
I understand. Now, let me ask you, in a scenario where there's a large truck blocking your lane and you can't see ahead, how would you handle it? It's quite dangerous since your view is obstructed. What would you typically do in such a situation?

**Speaker 2:**
I would slightly move to the left and try to pass the truck from behind. However, I realize that this isn't always the best approach. If someone suddenly appears in front of the truck, I might not have enough time to react. Ideally, I should slow down when approaching such a vehicle and be more cautious, especially if there are pedestrians around. Today, I might not have been as attentive as I should be, but generally, I try to maintain a slower speed in such situations.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it. Now, when you drive, do you pay attention to the passengers' experience in your car?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I do pay attention to the passengers' experience.

**Speaker 1:**
What aspects do you focus on, for example?

**Speaker 2:**
I observe their expressions and overall state. Are they sleeping? Do they look dizzy? If I'm with good friends, we might chat and have a good time, which makes the drive more enjoyable for everyone.

**Speaker 1:**
If you notice certain expressions or behaviors, what specific actions do you take?

**Speaker 2:**
If someone seems to be getting carsick, I might open the windows slightly for some fresh air. If someone feels cold, I'll adjust the air conditioning to make it warmer. Conversely, if it's too hot, I'll cool it down. If they want to listen to music, I'll play some to make the ride more pleasant.
Speaker 1:
If it's hot, you might want to turn the air conditioning up a bit, and if it's cold, you might want to turn it down. Adjusting the air conditioning can make the car more comfortable. If someone needs music, you can connect via Bluetooth.

Speaker 2:
Yes, connecting music is straightforward. As for driving, I try to keep the speed smooth, avoiding sudden acceleration or braking. I press the gas pedal gently, even if it means going slower, to ensure a more comfortable ride for everyone.

Speaker 1:
Do you think you have any bad driving habits that might make passengers uncomfortable?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I used to have a habit of accelerating quickly from 0 to 100 at traffic lights. When the light turned green, I would floor the gas pedal, causing a sudden jolt. This abrupt start and stop could make passengers feel dizzy. Sometimes, I also struggled with braking smoothly. If I pressed the brake pedal too hard, it would cause a sudden stop, which isn't comfortable for passengers. It's better to brake gradually for a smooth stop.

Speaker 1:
Do you have any other bad habits while driving?

Speaker 2:
Not really. I think those are the main ones. I try to be mindful of my driving habits.

Speaker 1:
When you're a passenger, what driving behaviors from others make you uncomfortable?

Speaker 2:
One thing that bothers me is when drivers don't check their mirrors properly. They might not be aware of their surroundings. Other than that, I think most drivers are okay.

Speaker 1:
Today, we have some data from passengers. They have been given a device to indicate when they feel uncomfortable. Would you be willing to review this data?

Speaker 2:
Sure, I would like to see where they felt uncomfortable. After watching the video, we can discuss it further. Considering passenger comfort is important, and I try to be mindful of it. If I notice a passenger looking uncomfortable during sudden acceleration, I try to adjust my driving accordingly.
Speaker 1:
Can you tell if he has a target? I might be a bit concerned about this issue. I might feel a bit uncomfortable or nervous, which could lead to mistakes. This car is a hybrid, and it runs smoothly below 40 mph.

Speaker 2:
Yes, when it uses electric power during initial acceleration, it feels smoother. It might seem like the power is insufficient, but actually, it’s designed to be seamless, so you don’t feel the acceleration.

Speaker 1:
Right, because this car is designed to be smooth. Even if you press the accelerator hard, it won’t speed up abruptly.

Speaker 2:
But how do you think we can make passengers feel more comfortable? Based on your driving today, is there anything extra you could do to improve the experience?

Speaker 1:
I enjoy test driving cars. If I didn’t want to test its acceleration, I would just drive it slowly and steadily. But today, I wanted to see how this new car performs in terms of acceleration and handling. I have my own thoughts and habits, and I feel it could be better in some aspects.

Speaker 2:
Besides that, is there anything else?

Speaker 1:
Let’s look at this video. This intersection is crucial in our test route because it doesn’t have traffic lights. How did you observe and decide whether to turn or go through the intersection?

Speaker 2:
I think you should first look to the right, then to the left. If there are no cars, you can look ahead. Sometimes, you might need to look forward again. For a right turn, you look right first, then left, and if it’s clear, you turn.

Speaker 1:
This road usually has a lot of traffic. Please stay in the right lane for 150 meters. Turn right at the traffic light. Let’s keep the video running without pausing. I have another question: what do you think makes a good or professional driver?

Speaker 2:
A professional driver, especially one driving for a boss or someone important, should ensure a smooth ride. The passenger in the back should not feel the car accelerating or decelerating abruptly. When taking turns, you should slow down. A good driver makes the ride comfortable and seamless.
Speaker 1:
When you drive, you don't feel the acceleration during the holidays. When taking a turn, you need to slow down a bit. I think the definition of a good driver is whether you are driving for yourself or aiming to provide a valuable experience for your passengers. These are two different concepts.

Speaker 2:
I think if you are driving for yourself, I am someone who pursues a valuable experience. So, I believe that rapid acceleration and deceleration can provide a sense of how the car and the driver work together. You can feel the mechanical interaction, the throttle response, and the braking. This mechanical feel can also ensure a certain level of safety. It's not that driving slowly is always safe, nor is driving fast always unsafe. It depends on the road conditions and maintaining an appropriate distance. It's about having the right mindset.

Speaker 2:
If you have passengers in the back, you should make them feel comfortable. When accelerating, do it gradually and maintain a relatively moderate speed. People generally feel comfortable at around 60 to 70 km/h, but once you exceed 80 km/h, it can become stressful and tense. On the highway, the front passenger might feel more nervous than the driver because they are not in control. So, I think it's better to keep the speed a bit lower, accelerate and brake smoothly, and stay observant.

Speaker 1:
Is this how professional drivers operate as well?

Speaker 2:
What do you mean by professional drivers? Are you referring to those who drive for a living, like chauffeurs?

Speaker 1:
Yes, I mean those who drive professionally, perhaps for a boss or as a career.

Speaker 2:
Yes, they would operate similarly. Their standards might be even stricter. They need to be more precise, for example, when approaching a railroad crossing, they might slow down gradually and stop more precisely than I would. But if there are other factors to consider...

Speaker 1:
Have you ever experienced riding with a professional driver?

Speaker 2:
Not really, I haven't had that experience.

Speaker 1:
Okay, the next question is, what do you think is the biggest difference between an experienced driver and a novice driver? You can take a moment to think about it as we make this right turn.

Speaker 2:
I think the biggest difference is confidence. As a novice driver, I was nervous and hesitant to get on the road. I would drive very slowly, even if there were no cars ahead. I would drive at 30 or 40 km/h, which is quite slow. Another difference is that novice drivers tend to be less smooth in their maneuvers...
Speaker 1:
When you're hesitant to drive, you tend to drive very slowly. Even if there are no cars ahead, you might still drive at 30 or 40 km/h, which indicates you're driving very slowly. That's one difference. Another difference is how new drivers change lanes. Their concept of lane changing might not be as good as someone more experienced. For example, if I want to change lanes in complex traffic conditions, I can do it calmly without feeling too nervous. However, new drivers might feel naturally tense and unsure about avoiding obstacles, which can make them even more nervous. They might not check their surroundings thoroughly, like looking left before turning right. They might just turn without checking properly. Over time, with more practice, they can improve. So, one issue is speed, and the other is awareness.

Speaker 2:
Yes, that's a difference. Alright, let's look at this video. You had a green light on the right, and you were the first in line. You were turning right, and there were no cars in the right lane, correct? You checked the right side for non-motorized vehicles, and then...

Speaker 1:
...looked to the left.

Speaker 2:
Yes, looked to the left. The non-motorized vehicle on the left ran a red light. How would you handle such a situation?

Speaker 1:
If it's far enough, I would just let it pass. If it's closer...

Speaker 2:
In this situation, the distance was gradually decreasing, and there was no clear intention from the other party to yield.

Speaker 1:
I can't remember if I slowed down, but...

Speaker 2:
I would slow down to let them pass because...

Speaker 1:
Non-motorized vehicles are more vulnerable. If you hit them, it would be troublesome, even if it's not your fault. It's better to let them pass and avoid any hassle.

Speaker 2:
So, when you encounter conflicts with non-motorized vehicles, you choose to yield?

Speaker 1:
Yes, I always yield, though I might curse them. But I still let them go because there's no other choice.

Speaker 2:
How do you judge if they won't yield to you?

Speaker 1:
If they don't slow down, you can tell they won't yield.

Speaker 2:
Yes, if they don't slow down, they won't yield.

Speaker 1:
Got it. That's what I wanted to ask.
**Speaker 1:**
So, you came out without slowing down.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, he didn't slow down, and he couldn't get out.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it. I wanted to ask, I noticed you turned over here and went straight into the middle lane. Is it your habit to usually choose the middle lane when driving?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because there are too many non-motorized vehicles on the right side. I don't like driving there.

**Speaker 1:**
I see.

**Speaker 2:**
So, I usually stay in the middle lane.

**Speaker 1:**
If there's no traffic in the middle lane.

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
I have a question that might be a bit difficult to answer. What do you think are the aspects where autonomous vehicles can't perform like human drivers?

**Speaker 2:**
Well, I think the first thing is that autonomous driving systems can't react subconsciously like humans. For example, if a car suddenly cuts in from the right while you're driving, can the autonomous system recognize it and take evasive action? That's the first point. The second point is about sudden obstacles. Do you think it can handle such scenarios effectively?

**Speaker 1:**
You mean it might struggle with sudden obstacles and taking proactive evasive actions?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it might struggle. For example...

**Speaker 1:**
Why do you think it would struggle?

**Speaker 2:**
I think it depends on the situation. I'm not sure how advanced current AI is, but I believe that sometimes human instinctive reactions can be quicker and more effective than AI.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you mean that in an emergency, humans might react faster than the system?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, for instance, if there's a sudden obstacle ahead, you might brake and steer quickly to avoid it. 

**Speaker 1:**
You think steering is faster than braking?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, steering can be faster because if you just brake, you might not stop in time, especially at high speeds.

**Speaker 1:**
And you think autonomous vehicles can't handle this?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, they might only brake.

**Speaker 1:**
Even if they brake faster than humans, they might not steer effectively?

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly, they might not be able to steer quickly enough. Also, if the route isn't clear, what will they do?

**Speaker 1:**
You mean if the lane markings are unclear?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, if the white lines are unclear...
Speaker 1:
What if the route isn't clear? How do you handle that?

Speaker 2:
If the lane markings are unclear, it becomes difficult for the car to recognize the lane, making it hard to ensure safety.

Speaker 1:
Exactly, how can you maintain automatic driving in such a situation? And what about other scenarios, like if a bike or a flying car suddenly appears on your right? How do you avoid them?

Speaker 2:
That's a good point. Smaller objects might not be detected easily.

Speaker 1:
So, you think the self-driving car might not recognize them?

Speaker 2:
It might recognize them, but I'm not sure if it can consistently avoid them. I don't know how well it can detect non-motorized vehicles.

Speaker 1:
I understand. Are there any other concerns?

Speaker 2:
Well, I think...

Speaker 1:
You've probably test-driven many cars and are familiar with the current features of autonomous and assisted driving. I'd like to discuss this further with you.

Speaker 2:
I actually hope for better autonomous driving because it can help reduce many issues on highways. However, I still think human judgment is crucial. Autonomous systems lack the nuanced decision-making of humans. They might be able to recognize situations but can't always react as a human would. Even if an autonomous car can identify and handle various road conditions, it doesn't always communicate this effectively to the passengers.

Speaker 1:
So, the car can't reassure the passengers that it can handle these situations, which makes people anxious.

Speaker 2:
Exactly. People need to know the system's capabilities through repeated testing. Many are unaware of how advanced these systems are.

Speaker 1:
So, you think there needs to be better communication between the car and the passengers, informing them of the car's capabilities?

Speaker 2:
Yes, that's right.
**Speaker 1:**
When you're driving with passengers, do you think it's important to communicate with them, or should they be proactive in informing you about handling certain situations?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I believe it's essential for people to understand that society is constantly progressing. When it comes to autonomous driving, people need to know that the technology can handle these situations. By the time the system informs you, it might be too late because it reacts quickly. It won't say, "I need to stop now." So, when AI and autonomous driving technology reach a certain level, the system will handle it. This is what I mean. Currently, people's mindset hasn't fully adapted to this. 

**Speaker 1:**
I understand. Right now, we only have assisted driving, which is just that—assistance. No car manufacturer claims that their system can handle everything completely autonomously. That's simply not possible with current technology.

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly. Assisted driving is just that—assistance. No car company can claim full autonomy yet.

**Speaker 1:**
We're approaching a figure-eight road ahead, and then we'll head back. Let's take a look at our video. I remember during the test drive, you were quite aggressive with the accelerator, especially on the North Fourth Ring Road. Did you intentionally press the accelerator hard?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I wanted to test the accelerator's response.

**Speaker 1:**
I understand. I was in the passenger seat and felt the sudden acceleration.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I wanted to see how the car would respond. I needed to test its capabilities to understand it better.

**Speaker 1:**
In situations where there's a non-electric vehicle ahead and the road is partially blocked, the vehicle might need to move left. In such cases, do you yield?

**Speaker 2:**
No, if the other driver doesn't yield and keeps moving forward, I won't yield either. 

**Speaker 1:**
When do you decide to yield?

**Speaker 2:**
If the other driver slows down, I might not need to yield. 

**Speaker 1:**
Do you often use the horn to alert others?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I use the horn to alert others.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you use the horn more for alerting or warning?

**Speaker 2:**
More for warning than alerting.

**Speaker 1:**
So, when you use the horn, you're indicating your intentions clearly.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. I use the horn to make my intentions clear.
**Speaker 1:** What should I do to avoid causing trouble? Yes, yes, I won't cause trouble. I'll go ahead. Yes, turn right, got it. And our video is still running, right? We have two more questions left, and they might be a bit difficult to answer. The first question is, how do you judge the intentions of pedestrians, non-motorized vehicles, and motorized vehicles while driving? We can start with pedestrians since there are quite a few here.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, you stop when you encounter pedestrians. Don't do anything else, just stop and wait until the pedestrians have crossed. When there are fewer people, you can proceed. Judging the intentions of pedestrians is the hardest. Nowadays, regardless of the situation, whether it's a pedestrian crossing or any other scenario, you need to yield to them. So, you should always yield first. Once the pedestrian has crossed, you can go ahead, regardless of whether they intend to cross the road or not.

**Speaker 1:** So, you mean it's difficult to judge the intentions of pedestrians, so we shouldn't try to judge them at all.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I had an experience once. While driving, there was a pedestrian far away from my car. I was in the last lane, and the pedestrian was quite far. But as I moved forward, a traffic officer stopped me and said I didn't watch out for the pedestrian. Although I wasn't fined, I was given a warning. They are enforcing this more strictly now.

**Speaker 1:** So, you got a warning for not yielding to the pedestrian.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, even if you see them, you should act the same way. You can't predict their actions.

**Speaker 1:** If you speed up and they suddenly run, you can't predict that.

**Speaker 2:** Exactly, you can't differentiate their actions.

**Speaker 1:** Right.

**Speaker 2:** The same goes for non-motorized vehicles. You should stop and let them pass. You can't predict their movements either.

**Speaker 1:** You really can't judge their intentions.

**Speaker 2:** There's no way to predict where they will go. So, you should yield to them. Watch their movements and yield. That's the best approach.

**Speaker 1:** But during tests or practical driving, I often find myself...
Speaker 1:
The best way is to observe their movements and yield accordingly.

Speaker 2:
Yes, but in situations where there are too many non-motorized vehicles, and one of them is moving slowly in front, you need to assess the situation. For example, if there are a lot of motor vehicles heading in the same direction, it can be different.

Speaker 1:
I understand. So, when there are too many vehicles or the situation is too complex, it becomes difficult to make a judgment.

Speaker 2:
Exactly, and in such cases, you might choose to stop and yield. However, if there are only one or two non-motorized vehicles or pedestrians, the approach might be different.

Speaker 1:
Yes, if there are fewer pedestrians, you might stop, but for fewer non-motorized vehicles, you might not stop. How do you understand their intentions in such cases?

Speaker 2:
If a non-motorized vehicle doesn't slow down at all, I might get nervous because I don't know if accelerating will cause a collision. If there's a vehicle on the right and I can see it, I can ensure safety by stopping and letting it pass. But if there's another car behind me, stopping suddenly might cause an accident.

Speaker 1:
So, you wouldn't stop abruptly.

Speaker 2:
Right, because it could be dangerous for both of us.

Speaker 1:
So, you prefer to use the horn to warn them.

Speaker 2:
Yes, to alert them not to proceed because they are in the wrong lane. They should move to the side. If they don't see my car and continue, it could be dangerous.

Speaker 1:
Sometimes, non-motorized vehicles don't indicate their intentions clearly.

Speaker 2:
Exactly, and in such cases, you have to be cautious.

Speaker 1:
What about motor vehicles? They are relatively easier to predict.

Speaker 2:
Yes, motor vehicles usually have indicators and brake lights to signal their intentions.
Speaker 1:
How do you judge the behavior of motor vehicles? Motor vehicles are relatively easier to predict.

Speaker 2:
Yes, but you still need to be cautious as they can change lanes suddenly.

Speaker 1:
Besides using turn signals and brake lights, how do you judge a motor vehicle's intentions, especially since many drivers don't follow the rules?

Speaker 2:
You have to be vigilant. If a vehicle is trying to cut in, you need to anticipate it. In a place like Shenzhen, where this happens often, you should give way because it's not worth the risk of a collision. How do you ensure you reach your destination safely?

Speaker 1:
What about when you need to make a left turn? Apart from aggressive drivers, do you also observe other indicators on the vehicle to predict its movements?

Speaker 2:
It's difficult to judge from a distance. You can only make a better judgment when you're closer.

Speaker 1:
So, you can only make a decision when you're near the vehicle?

Speaker 2:
Yes, if they don't use their turn signals, it's hard to predict their actions. You have to be prepared for sudden lane changes.

Speaker 1:
So, there's no way to anticipate their moves in advance?

Speaker 2:
Exactly, it's not always clear.

Speaker 1:
Got it. Now, let's look at this video again. We're at a section without traffic signals, making a left turn. How do you decide whether to yield to a pedestrian or expect them to yield to you?

Speaker 2:
If the pedestrian isn't paying attention, I usually proceed if I think there's enough distance. I don't wait if I feel it's safe to go.

Speaker 1:
So, you accelerate to pass them?

Speaker 2:
Yes, but ideally, you should follow the rules and yield.

Speaker 1:
Alright, 100 meters ahead, we reach another intersection. Let's pause the video here. One last question: imagine a scenario similar to the one we just saw, with no traffic signals and pedestrians crossing. How do you decide who should go first?

Speaker 1:
Both parties need to assess the situation and decide who should yield to ensure safe passage through the intersection.
Speaker 1:
There are times when you both encounter a situation where you need to decide who should go first and who should yield.

Speaker 2:
Yes, each of us needs to decide how to proceed through the intersection. One possible scenario is when you see a pedestrian, you hit the brakes to let them cross. But then, the pedestrian sees you and stops, afraid that the car might hit them. So, both of you end up stopping and waiting, creating a standoff. Then, you both realize the other has stopped, and you both start moving at the same time, which can be quite awkward. Have you experienced such situations while driving?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I have encountered such situations, but I usually don't start moving again. I let the pedestrian go first to avoid this kind of situation. I generally don't start moving if the pedestrian starts moving. If they do start moving, I make sure to signal them to go ahead.

Speaker 1:
So, you always choose to yield and let the pedestrian go first, rather than trying to move again after they stop. Got it. Another scenario is in Beijing, where many people cross the street together, ignoring the traffic lights once a large enough group has gathered. If you're the first car, once you let the first pedestrian pass, a whole crowd might follow, and you could end up waiting for a long time, possibly missing your own green light. How would you handle this situation?

Speaker 2:
There's no way around it. You have to let them all cross. There's nothing you can do because you can't just drive through and risk hitting someone. Even if the cars behind me get impatient, I have to stay put and wait.

Speaker 1:
So, even if it takes a long time, you would wait for all the pedestrians to cross. Understood. I think that's all the questions I have. After we watch the video of the incident, we can discuss it further. Once we finish watching, we can conclude today's interview and proceed to the main road, then move to the leftmost lane. Make sure to stop wherever necessary.

Speaker 2:
Alright, 400 meters ahead at the traffic light, stay on the main road. 300 meters ahead.

Speaker 1:
At this point, you can speed up because there are no cars. Stay in the left lane, and at the traffic light, merge onto the side road. Then, turn right in 200 meters. Got it? The camera will capture the side road, then turn right in 200 meters. It's not easy for either of us, but we only have one chance. Alright, you have 3 minutes and 40 seconds.
Speaker 1: In 200 meters, turn right. Got it? There's a camera as you enter the side road, then turn right in 200 meters. It's just one turn, and it's not easy for either of us, but we only have one turn to make. Alright, you have 3 minutes and 40 seconds, right? It's serious.

Speaker 2: And then there's that...

Speaker 1: What? Right.

Speaker 2: Look at this area. See that car moving slowly? Leave a bit of space behind it. There's also a pedestrian here. I'll turn right slowly in 200 meters. There's no merging lane. Okay.

Speaker 1: 13 minutes and 40 seconds. Quickly, turn right. That's it.

Speaker 2: Sometimes, a person learning to drive might feel that way.

Speaker 1: They might feel that way, yes.

Speaker 2: This person, the one in the passenger seat, is an instructor, right? I'm not sure whose issue it is. Yes, that's the one.

Speaker 1: We are stuck here for a minute. There's a traffic violation camera 100 meters ahead. I think the most dangerous part is the passive reaction to it.

Speaker 2: We're about to reach the destination. Then turn left. Yes, that's it. Just like before.

Speaker 1: Do you have any questions on your end? Alright, that concludes our interview for today. Good. I have a form that needs to be filled out. Okay, I mentioned that you need to provide some bank card information. Okay, I'll be here.
