**Speaker 1:**
Hey, the eye tracker is on. Alright, can you say something to test it? Hello, hello, there shouldn't be any issues. In a moment, we will review a significant video. We are still in the import phase. Can you see it on your end? Is the recording still ongoing? Have you joined the meeting?

**Speaker 1:**
Do you have a pen? Today? Okay, let's slowly import it now. Meanwhile, I'll explain some pre-interview details. Let me introduce myself again. My name is Chang Xiang, and I will be responsible for the final part of your interview today. In a moment, we will watch a video recorded by the eye tracker during the experiment. Now that it has been imported, we can explore your usual driving habits. At any point in the video where you find something interesting, or if I find something interesting, we can pause and discuss it. Can you see the red dot?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I can see it.

**Speaker 1:**
The red dot represents the focus of your gaze at that moment. If possible, I will ask you some specific questions. Just say whatever comes to mind, no need to be nervous. It's just like a regular conversation. If there's a question you don't want to answer, you can let me know, and I won't press you. All the data from today's interview will be anonymized, and your personal information will not be disclosed. We are not recording with a camera, so you can see the video clearly, right? Good. Let me increase the volume a bit.

**Speaker 1:**
Now, I'll start the video from the moment you began driving. Here we go. During the interview, for example, before turning at an intersection or making a U-turn, I will first ask about your usual driving habits. After that, you can describe in detail your specific actions when driving in such scenarios, whether it's observing, handling the steering wheel, or using the accelerator and brake. We are very interested in these detailed operations.

**Speaker 1:**
After discussing your habits, we will watch the video to see your specific actions and whether they align with your described habits. If they don't, we will discuss the reasons for your actions today. Before we get into the detailed questions, let me start with some simpler ones. Before this experiment, did you...
**Interviewer:** What was the reason behind your driving operation today? Before we get into the main questions, let me ask you some simpler ones. What types of cars have you driven before this experiment? For example, have you driven gasoline cars, electric cars, SUVs, sedans, etc.?

**Interviewee:** Mostly sedans.

**Interviewer:** Have you driven electric cars? Which ones? NIO? Do you drive it often or just occasionally test drive?

**Interviewee:** I've tried it a few times.

**Interviewer:** A friend's car, perhaps? Got it. What type of car do you drive most frequently?

**Interviewee:** Mainly sedans.

**Interviewer:** Is it your own sedan? Can you tell me what kind it is?

**Interviewee:** Yes, it's my own sedan.

**Interviewer:** Do any of the cars you've driven have driver assistance features? What specific features do they have?

**Interviewee:** They have ACC.

**Interviewer:** ACC is Adaptive Cruise Control, right? Does that count?

**Interviewee:** Yes, it does.

**Interviewer:** What other features?

**Interviewee:** Lane departure warning, lane-keeping assist, and pedestrian monitoring.

**Interviewer:** How does the pedestrian monitoring work?

**Interviewee:** There are effective cameras around the car, especially at the rear.

**Interviewer:** So, if it detects a pedestrian, what happens?

**Interviewee:** It alerts me through the car's system if there's a pedestrian in the blind spot.

**Interviewer:** Which car model is this, if you don't mind me asking?

**Interviewee:** BMW 3 Series.

**Interviewer:** Any other cars?

**Interviewee:** NIO as well. NIO's electric cars are quite advanced, but gasoline cars have fewer features.

**Interviewer:** How do you feel about using these features? Are they helpful?

**Interviewee:** They are not particularly intelligent.

**Interviewer:** Not particularly intelligent?

**Interviewee:** Sometimes they alert too early or give false alarms.

**Interviewer:** But they can still solve some issues, right?

**Interviewee:** They can solve about 30% of the problems, but 70% still need manual intervention.

**Interviewer:** So, you feel they are not very useful compared to relying on your own eyes. Why do you think that is, aside from false alarms?

**Interviewee:** I don't fully trust these systems; they don't seem mature enough.

**Interviewer:** Are there any features that left a strong impression on you?

**Interviewee:** ACC, Adaptive Cruise Control.

**Interviewer:** Do you use it often?

**Interviewee:** Yes, it's very comfortable for long-distance driving. I don't have to constantly watch the road, and I can relax my grip on the steering wheel a bit. It's very useful for long trips.

**Interviewer:** Do you usually drive more in the city or on long trips?

**Interviewee:** I drive short distances more often.

**Interviewer:** So, short trips make up the majority?

**Interviewee:** Yes, about 70%.

**Interviewer:** How did you feel driving our vehicle today? Were there any unfamiliar aspects that affected your driving?

**Interviewee:** Very few. The accelerator felt a bit soft.
**Interviewer:** How did you feel driving our vehicle today? Were there any aspects you found unfamiliar that affected your driving?

**Driver:** The accelerator felt a bit soft, and the brakes too. Sorry, I misspoke.

**Interviewer:** The brakes felt soft? Do you mean that pressing them slightly didn't have much effect, like there was some play?

**Driver:** Yes, there was quite a bit of play. Normally, I drive a German car.

**Interviewer:** So, you're used to a more immediate response when you press the pedal?

**Driver:** Exactly, that's the only issue. Everything else was fine.

**Interviewer:** How about the gear shifting? Did you notice any issues there?

**Driver:** The shifting logic seemed a bit off.

**Interviewer:** Do you understand the feel of the buttons?

**Driver:** Yes, once the car is moving.

**Interviewer:** You mean the automatic upshifting and downshifting?

**Driver:** Yes, the logic felt a bit weak in this car.

**Interviewer:** What do you think is the reason for that?

**Driver:** It might be due to maintenance issues. When accelerating quickly, the gear shifting doesn't keep up. The RPMs go up, but the car doesn't shift down to a lower gear for better acceleration. It just stays in a high gear, making noise but not moving efficiently.

**Interviewer:** I see. If you don't mind me asking, have you ever been involved in any traffic accidents? Could you share some details?

**Driver:** No problem, just minor ones.

**Interviewer:** Could you describe what happened?

**Driver:** Sure. Once, during a traffic jam, I was making a right turn. My car has an automatic parking brake feature that engages when you press the brake pedal. I was a bit tired and turned it off to stay alert. I forgot I had turned it off, and when I released the brake, I rolled forward and lightly bumped the car in front of me. It was very slow, just starting to move. Another time, I was parking and didn't see a metal barrier painted in black and yellow. The rearview mirror didn't show it, and the parking sensors didn't go off. I ended up scratching the right rear door.

**Interviewer:** Did you hear any noise when that happened?

**Driver:** No, I didn't hear anything. I only noticed the scratch when I got out of the car.

**Interviewer:** Do you think these minor accidents have affected your driving? Have they made you more cautious?

**Driver:** Yes, they have made me more observant, especially when parking.

**Interviewer:** So, most of these incidents happened while parking?

**Driver:** Yes, mostly. There was also an incident while passing another car.

**Interviewer:** What happened then?

**Driver:** The oncoming car was turning left, and I was worried about scraping its tail light.
**Speaker 2:**
There was also another situation, and another one as well.

**Speaker 1:**
With the oncoming car?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the oncoming car was turning left, and I was afraid it might scrape my tail light.

**Speaker 1:**
So, the tail light was on your side, and as he was turning left, you also turned left and ended up scraping his car. Was it the tail light that got scraped, or was it the front or rear of the car?

**Speaker 2:**
It was the left door. My left front door scraped his left rear door.

**Speaker 1:**
After these incidents, do you pay extra attention while driving? Or do you feel any psychological impact from these events?

**Speaker 2:**
Not as severe as people might think. It was just an accident, and I pretty much drive the same as before.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, let's review this video. Pay attention as we exit because the first turn is a right turn, and then we enter a long auxiliary road. It's not this right turn, but the next one. Can you share your usual driving habits when making turns? Let's start with right turns since we have a series of them coming up.

**Speaker 2:**
First, I check if there are any cars coming from the left in the same direction.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you turn while checking for cars coming from the left in the same direction?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, and then I check if there are any oncoming cars as I approach the turn.

**Speaker 1:**
By oncoming, you mean cars coming from the opposite direction?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, and finally, I check the right rear for any pedestrians or cyclists before making the turn.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you observe in three steps. What about steering, accelerating, and braking?

**Speaker 2:**
I usually don't accelerate while entering the turn.

**Speaker 1:**
You lightly brake to be ready for any sudden vehicles?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, and once I exit the turn and see it's safe, I accelerate.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it. Now, let's look at the first turn. Can you tell me what you were observing when you looked to the right? Were you watching the car in front or something else?

**Speaker 2:**
I was observing the car in front. If it stops, it might indicate that there is an oncoming car from the left.

**Speaker 1:**
Because you can't see the left side due to a blind spot?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, there are blind spots and some data we rely on for observation.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you judge the situation based on the behavior and movement of the car in front. How did you develop this skill?

**Speaker 2:**
I'm not sure.
**Speaker 1:**
You have a hobby of observing driving patterns. How do you judge the road and traffic conditions ahead? How did you develop this skill?

**Speaker 2:**
I'm not entirely sure. I think it's just a habit I developed when I started driving.

**Speaker 1:**
So, from the beginning, you liked to observe how the vehicles in front of you were moving?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because you need to consider various factors about the road conditions. You can't rely solely on your own eyes; you also need to observe the movements of other vehicles on the road.

**Speaker 1:**
While providing city navigation, you mentioned observing the situation of an oncoming vehicle from the left. At that moment, there was also a taxi approaching. Did you feel it was far away from you?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it had already signaled and started to slow down.

**Speaker 1:**
It was going to make a right turn?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's why I slightly adjusted my position. Otherwise, I would have had to stop.

**Speaker 1:**
You flashed your turn signal and then made the turn. I noticed that. Good.

**Speaker 2:**
I was also checking the rearview mirror while making the turn.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you always check the rearview mirror when turning?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I always take a quick glance to ensure there are no unexpected movements from other vehicles.

**Speaker 1:**
At that moment, you were checking the rearview mirror again. I noticed that you tend to make wide right turns. Are you aware of this habit?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I think it's safer that way.

**Speaker 1:**
Why do you feel it's safer?

**Speaker 2:**
It helps protect my car from hitting the right-side barriers or obstacles.

**Speaker 1:**
Because the right side is farther from the driver's seat compared to the left side?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, and judging the distance on the left side is more accurate. Also, it gives other drivers more time to react. If I take a wider turn, they can better anticipate my movements.

**Speaker 1:**
I understand. But there's also a saying that you should make tight right turns and wide left turns. What do you think about that?

**Speaker 2:**
As long as it doesn't affect traffic, I prefer making wider turns. However, if the traffic is heavy or I'm driving on a mountain road, I will follow the rule of making tighter turns.

**Speaker 1:**
Because you can't occupy the other lane?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, and there are blind spots. You have to stay within your lane.
**Speaker 1:**
When driving in the mountains, you still need to make sharp turns. You can't take up the other lane.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because there are blind spots, and you have to stay in your lane.

**Speaker 1:**
Let's continue watching the video. Up ahead, there's a point where you merge from a side road onto the main road. Can you describe your usual process for merging?

**Speaker 2:**
I usually start by observing the traffic with the help of my car's technology. This saves time. If it's safe, I accelerate and merge. If there's heavy traffic, I stop at the junction and wait.

**Speaker 1:**
You look to the left?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I prefer to turn my head and look through the rear window.

**Speaker 1:**
You can see further that way.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because sometimes the mirrors don't show everything.

**Speaker 1:**
At this point, your mirrors might not show any cars coming. So, you turn your head to check?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I look outside to get a better view.

**Speaker 1:**
If there are no cars, you merge onto the main road. In this scenario, you checked your left mirror and saw a black car closely following you. How did you decide whether to merge or not?

**Speaker 2:**
I checked its speed. If it was sticking close to me, I would either accelerate or let the system assist me.

**Speaker 1:**
So, what did you do?

**Speaker 2:**
I observed and let the car pass first.

**Speaker 1:**
You let it go ahead. After 300 meters, you reached your destination. If the car was closely following, you let it pass because the traffic wasn't smooth.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
There was also a taxi on your left. Taxis can be unpredictable. Why did you decide to merge left instead of waiting?

**Speaker 2:**
The taxi's speed was similar to mine, maybe a bit slower. It didn't seem like it wanted to overtake me. After I signaled, I gave it time to react.

**Speaker 1:**
It didn't try to overtake you or speed up.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it adjusted its speed, allowing me to merge.

**Speaker 1:**
The black car immediately passed when you gave it time. So, you let it go. Can you describe your driving habits on straight, steady-speed roads?

**Speaker 2:**
Sure.
**Interviewer:** Could you describe your usual driving habits when you're on a straight, steady-speed road?

**Driver:** Sure, I generally try to avoid heavy traffic.

**Interviewer:** How do you avoid traffic? What's your basic approach?

**Driver:** I try to drive in areas where there are fewer cars ahead or where the traffic is lighter.

**Interviewer:** How far do you usually keep from the car in front of you?

**Driver:** I maintain a distance of about 50 to 100 meters.

**Interviewer:** So, at your current speed, you keep a distance of 50 to 100 meters from the car in front, like a BMW?

**Driver:** Yes, that's right. I also prefer to overtake cars to ensure a safer distance.

**Interviewer:** Besides maintaining distance, what else do you do?

**Driver:** I frequently check my mirrors to observe the traffic on my left, right, and behind.

**Interviewer:** Why do you check the traffic around you?

**Driver:** To be honest, it's to avoid potential collisions. Other drivers might change lanes or overtake unexpectedly.

**Interviewer:** I see. So, you prepare in advance for any lane changes?

**Driver:** Exactly.

**Interviewer:** On a straight, steady-speed road, what speed do you usually maintain?

**Driver:** I drive slightly faster than the average speed of the traffic.

**Interviewer:** Why do you choose to drive faster than the average speed?

**Driver:** If the traffic is moving at a steady 60 km/h, I prefer to go a bit faster. I use the surrounding traffic speed as a benchmark rather than the speed limit.

**Interviewer:** So, you drive slightly above the average speed but below the speed limit?

**Driver:** Yes, my driving style is a bit aggressive but not reckless. I aim to reach my destination efficiently.

**Interviewer:** Now, let's talk about making a U-turn at an intersection. Can you share your usual habits when making a U-turn?

**Driver:** I usually don't rush to make a U-turn. I let the oncoming traffic pass first because U-turns can be dangerous.

**Interviewer:** Even when the light is green for both directions, you wait for the oncoming traffic to clear?

**Driver:** Yes, I wait for the oncoming traffic to pass before I make my move. I prioritize safety.

**Interviewer:** So, you ensure safety by waiting for the oncoming traffic to clear, even when making a left turn?

**Driver:** Yes, I make sure it's safe before proceeding. U-turns require extra caution as there are cars in all directions.

**Interviewer:** In today's scenario, while making a U-turn, you noticed a non-motorized vehicle coming towards you. Why did you turn the steering wheel to the right?

**Driver:** Yes, I saw it. It was my first time encountering such a situation.
Non-motorized vehicles were rushing in. Yes, can I ask if you turned the steering wheel to the right? Did you see that just now? I saw it. The reason is, first of all...

Speaker 2:
This is the first time making this U-turn.

Speaker 1:
Oh, this is the last...

Speaker 2:
Yes, yes, this is the last time.

Speaker 1:
The first time you tried to make the U-turn, you reached the car.

Speaker 2:
I felt that the car might be a bit...

Speaker 1:
Long. Yes, and then when you tried the second time, you managed to make the U-turn in one go. Yes, and during the actual test, you turned the steering wheel to the right.

Speaker 2:
The direction is different, it won't affect the opposite side.

Speaker 1:
Why could you make such a turn?

Speaker 2:
Because the turning radius became smaller, so...

Speaker 1:
Yes, the radius became smaller, meaning you had more space to turn.

Speaker 2:
Otherwise, I would have had to reverse halfway again.

Speaker 1:
Which would have been more difficult. But the premise is not to affect the ongoing traffic.

Speaker 2:
In such a complex situation where you have three cars making a U-turn and non-motorized vehicles cutting in, how did you handle it at that time?

Speaker 2:
I let the non-motorized vehicles go first. Whoever is faster goes first. Since there was a large vehicle blocking the way, it indicated that no cars could come from the opposite lane, so I chose to proceed directly.

Speaker 1:
With the large vehicle blocking the way, you felt it was very safe to make the U-turn.

Speaker 2:
It blocked all the lanes, so no one could come through. Just a moment. After the warning from the system, I was worried that the passengers might press the button because they might feel we were too close. Since the passengers don't control the steering wheel, they might feel we would scrape against something.

Speaker 1:
But you felt it was absolutely passable.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I felt it was passable, but the passengers might feel a bit stressed.

Speaker 1:
After completing the U-turn, you would have a straight-line acceleration process because the speed is very slow after the U-turn. Can you describe your usual driving habits during this straight-line acceleration process?

Speaker 2:
First, I observe if there are any intersections on both sides to ensure safety during acceleration. Then, ensuring the safety of others, I choose to accelerate quickly.

Speaker 1:
By accelerating quickly, do you mean the acceleration process is fast, or the final speed is high?

Speaker 2:
The acceleration process is fast, I press the accelerator harder.

Speaker 1:
You press the accelerator harder, about halfway down, faster than usual traffic light acceleration because there might be straight-moving vehicles behind that could interfere.

Speaker 2:
You need to keep up with them as much as possible.

Speaker 2:
Leave this slow route.

Speaker 2:
A hundred meters ahead, you will reach the destination.

Speaker 2:
At this point, I decelerated because I was worried about pedestrians getting off the bus.
Speaker 2:
I was driving on a slow route.

Speaker 2:
About 100 meters ahead, I reached a classic intersection.

Speaker 2:
At that moment, I started to decelerate because I was worried about pedestrians getting off the bus and possibly crossing in front of it.

Speaker 1:
You were particularly concerned about this situation, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, because it's an uncontrollable factor for me.

Speaker 1:
When did you start worrying about this?

Speaker 2:
From the moment I started driving, I was always cautious about such situations.

Speaker 1:
I mean, today, for example, when you saw the bus, you were already observing if there were any pedestrians, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I was already watching to see if any pedestrians were crossing. I kept an eye on the front of the bus and started to decelerate. I would first look ahead to see if there were any pedestrians, and then I would decide to accelerate.

Speaker 1:
I understand. So, after passing the bus, you had to make a right turn quickly to avoid staying behind it. Can you explain your usual habits when overtaking and changing lanes?

Speaker 2:
When overtaking, I make sure not to put too much pressure on the vehicle I'm passing. I choose a safe distance to overtake.

Speaker 1:
How do you determine a safe distance?

Speaker 2:
During the lane change, I ensure that my car's rear doesn't collide with the front of the other car.

Speaker 1:
How do you judge that the distance is enough for overtaking? Do you leave a specific gap?

Speaker 2:
I leave at least 10 to 20 meters for the other driver to react. After overtaking, I return to the original lane only after maintaining that distance.

Speaker 1:
So, you adjust the distance based on speed, right? If you're driving slowly, the distance can be shorter, but on the highway, it needs to be longer.

Speaker 2:
Exactly. If the speed is low, a shorter distance is fine. But at high speeds, a greater safety distance is necessary.

Speaker 1:
When you are about to overtake and change lanes, how do you manage the throttle, brakes, and steering?

Speaker 2:
I don't press the throttle too hard all at once. I gradually increase the pressure.

Speaker 1:
So, you press the throttle slowly and steadily.

Speaker 2:
Yes, if you press it too quickly, it can make passengers uncomfortable. Also, when changing direction, you shouldn't turn the steering wheel too quickly to avoid the car swaying.

Speaker 1:
To avoid fishtailing.

Speaker 2:
Yes, and braking isn't usually involved in overtaking. It's more about accelerating and changing lanes.

Speaker 1:
So, about 100 meters before overtaking, you start to ease off the throttle and prepare for the maneuver.
Speaker 1: Accelerate.

Speaker 2: It’s not about braking, it’s about overtaking and changing lanes. Right.

Speaker 1: When you’re about 100 meters away, you can ease off the accelerator and place your foot over the brake.

Speaker 2: Yes, because if you don’t brake, you might get too close to the car in front. When overtaking, your speed is higher, and if there are more cars, it’s hard to maintain a safe distance. In such cases, you might need to use the brake.

Speaker 1: Exactly, especially when there are fewer cars today.

Speaker 2: If the car in front is very close, and I’m halfway through overtaking and feel I can pass, I’ll ease off the accelerator before completing the overtake. If you wait until after overtaking to ease off, it can be problematic.

Speaker 1: So, for example, when you overtake a car on the right, you ease off the accelerator as you change lanes to the right.

Speaker 2: Yes, I ease off the accelerator and prepare to brake.

Speaker 1: So, you don’t wait until you’re back in the original lane to brake. Easing off the accelerator naturally slows you down as you return to the original lane.

Speaker 2: But you can’t slow down too much, or you’ll affect the car you just overtook. You need to leave enough space in front of the car behind you before turning right again. Were you able to see the situation on the side road?

Speaker 1: I noticed you were trying to look through the rear window.

Speaker 2: There was a green belt, and I couldn’t see the information in the side mirror clearly. The car’s side mirrors seemed small, or maybe I hadn’t adjusted the seat and mirrors properly.

Speaker 1: Did you readjust them later?

Speaker 2: Yes, but it took time to get used to it because it’s different from my usual car.

Speaker 1: Is the view in your usual car wider?

Speaker 2: Yes, my usual car has a wider view, larger side mirrors, and bigger windows.

Speaker 1: In 300 meters, you’ll reach your destination. Now, I’d like to ask you some questions beyond your driving habits. For the safety of this experiment, what did you particularly focus on while driving?

Speaker 2: What aspect of safety do you mean?

Speaker 1: In terms of driving, what did you focus on?

Speaker 2: Both operation and observation.

Speaker 1: Yes, in terms of driving.

Speaker 2: I kept the speed relatively low.
Speaker 1: So, regarding driving...

Speaker 2: Yes, in terms of both operation and observation.

Speaker 1: Both are considered part of driving.

Speaker 2: The speed of the car should be kept relatively low.

Speaker 1: Drive a bit slower, and...

Speaker 2: The braking should not be too abrupt.

Speaker 1: Brake more slowly and smoothly. I'm not sure about the relationship between smooth braking and safety, but...

Speaker 2: If you brake too hard and the car decelerates quickly, it might be difficult for pedestrians or other vehicles around you to react in time. Also, passengers in the car who might be drinking water or doing something else could get hurt.

Speaker 1: Besides braking, what else?

Speaker 2: I'm more concerned about...

Speaker 1: Pedestrians in the non-motorized lanes. Are you referring to cyclists or pedestrians walking in those lanes?

Speaker 2: Both cyclists and pedestrians. The situation in the non-motorized lanes can be quite complex, especially on city roads.

Speaker 1: Especially on urban roads.

Speaker 2: Yes, where there are more people than cars. It's important to pay attention to the conditions on the side roads and the right side.

Speaker 1: Anything else?

Speaker 2: Approaching intersections, especially in unfamiliar areas, requires extra observation because you don't know...

Speaker 1: Whether you need to turn left or right.

Speaker 2: Or if something unexpected might come up.

Speaker 1: So, how do you think driving can be made safer?

Speaker 2: The speed should not be too fast or too slow.

Speaker 1: Why shouldn't it be too slow?

Speaker 2: Driving too slowly can disrupt the flow of traffic and potentially lead to accidents.

Speaker 1: Understood. Anything else to make driving safer? Like focusing more attention?

Speaker 2: Yes, more observation. In this area, I tend to observe more than usual.

Speaker 1: Understood. So, in your driving experience during this experiment, what areas do you think could be improved for better safety?

Speaker 2: Adjusting the car settings more precisely, like the seat and mirrors.

Speaker 1: Adjusting the seat and mirrors better, and...

Speaker 2: Testing the car's acceleration and braking on an open road to understand its limits.

Speaker 1: Why test acceleration and braking?

Speaker 2: To understand the car's performance in emergency situations, like how quickly it can stop.

Speaker 1: To see if it can stop completely, and how much force and distance it takes.

Speaker 2: Yes, and in emergencies, you might need to accelerate instead of just braking. For example, if you see a collision ahead, you might need to change lanes quickly.

Speaker 1: So, you mean you need to feel the throttle response to know when you can accelerate quickly.
Speaker 1:
When changing lanes, if you rely on the steering wheel to avoid an obstacle, it might be too late. Do you mean that you need to...

Speaker 2:
You need to feel the depth of the accelerator. When is it comfortable to accelerate quickly?

Speaker 1:
Anything else?

Speaker 2:
You should also get a sense of the car's length and width, its overall size.

Speaker 1:
Where are the boundaries around the car? Get a feel for it. Yes, when you're new to a car, it can be hard to judge. Right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, because the dimensions are different, there will definitely be subtle differences.

Speaker 1:
Anything else?

Speaker 2:
Other things might be a bit more demanding, like the brakes or tires.

Speaker 1:
Safety checks?

Speaker 2:
Yes, shouldn't you check the car's condition?

Speaker 1:
Oh, I see. Can you recall any driving experiences where you felt particularly scared?

Speaker 2:
On relatively narrow roads, especially two-way streets.

Speaker 1:
Narrow two-way streets?

Speaker 2:
Yes, when overtaking pedestrians on non-motorized lanes.

Speaker 1:
You have to borrow the opposite lane.

Speaker 2:
Yes, and if the oncoming car is fast and doesn't yield, it can be scary.

Speaker 1:
You're driving against traffic, so they won't care about you. Right? In emergencies, you feel scared. How do you handle such situations?

Speaker 2:
If I'm familiar with my car, I usually choose to quickly overtake the pedestrian. If I can't, I'll brake and avoid.

Speaker 1:
You won't brake and then return to the non-motorized lane or behind the vehicle you're overtaking to avoid a collision with oncoming traffic.

Speaker 2:
Right, I won't take that risk because it's too dangerous.

Speaker 1:
So you return early. Besides narrow two-way streets, are there other scenarios that scare you?

Speaker 2:
Rainy or snowy weather. The first time I drove in snow, the car slipped and swerved, which made me very nervous.

Speaker 1:
Anything else?

Speaker 2:
Driving on highways, especially with large trucks.

Speaker 1:
Large trucks on the highway?

Speaker 2:
Yes, when they can't see you, it can be dangerous.

Speaker 1:
They have many blind spots and might not see you, which could lead to a collision.

Speaker 2:
Yes, if they squeeze into your lane, it can be very dangerous.

Speaker 1:
What should you do in that situation?

Speaker 2:
If I'm on the left, I'll honk or flash my high beams. If they react, I'll continue to accelerate. If I can't overtake and they keep changing lanes, I'll quickly brake.

Speaker 1:
So you slow down and give way. Got it. Do you think there are any bad driving habits you have?
Speaker 1:
If everyone continues to change lanes, you should quickly choose to brake.

Speaker 2:
So, slow down and give way. Got it. What do you think are some of your bad driving habits that could potentially lead to danger?

Speaker 1:
I often occupy the lane, is that okay?

Speaker 2:
Occupying the lane means driving against traffic or staying in the lane unnecessarily.

Speaker 1:
Why do you do that?

Speaker 2:
Because when there are no cars coming from the opposite direction, I feel that the space on both sides is ample, and I won't be disturbed by pedestrians.

Speaker 1:
And this leads to minor collisions.

Speaker 2:
The probability of hitting pedestrians is very low, and at intersections, I have more time to react.

Speaker 1:
Anything else?

Speaker 2:
I tend to drive fast when turning.

Speaker 1:
Why do you think you drive fast when turning? Can you specify which part of the turn is faster? You mentioned entering, exiting, and the middle of the turn.

Speaker 2:
The speed is faster when entering the turn.

Speaker 1:
The speed is faster when entering the turn.

Speaker 2:
I have a habit of driving a bit faster, chasing that feeling.

Speaker 1:
Do you then brake suddenly after entering the turn? Otherwise, it could be dangerous.

Speaker 2:
Yes, this unreasonable speed can easily lead to danger.

Speaker 1:
Anything else you think is problematic?

Speaker 2:
I often try to beat the traffic lights.

Speaker 1:
Do you mean running yellow lights? When there are a few seconds left, you choose to accelerate and rush through. Anything else?

Speaker 2:
I can't think of anything else right now. When you ride in someone else's car, like a taxi or a ride-share, what behaviors make you feel nervous and unsafe?

Speaker 1:
Unreasonable lane changes.

Speaker 2:
Especially with taxis or ride-shares.

Speaker 1:
Is it continuous lane changes, or do you think they change lanes unnecessarily?

Speaker 2:
For example, when they are in a hurry, they change lanes quickly, which can easily lead to accidents. Or they do it to reach the destination faster.

Speaker 1:
They might choose to overtake quickly and change lanes to get ahead.

Speaker 2:
For instance, if they need to turn left at an intersection but are in the far-right lane, they might cross multiple lanes to make the turn. Anything else?

Speaker 1:
The driver doesn't observe enough, only focusing on the direction they are driving and not paying attention to other sudden occurrences.

Speaker 2:
Anything else?

Speaker 1:
Can you give an example?
Speaker 1: The driver doesn't observe enough; they only focus on the direction they are driving and don't pay attention to other sudden occurrences.

Speaker 2: Is there anything else? Like when you reach your destination?

Speaker 1: Can you give me a hint? Let me think. Also...

Speaker 2: When you are a passenger in someone else's car, and they are driving, you might find their driving actions unsettling because they are different from how you drive. This makes you feel nervous, as if an accident is about to happen. You don't feel at ease unless you have the steering wheel in your own hands.

Speaker 1: The driver is very tense and behaves very...

Speaker 2: Upright and proper.

Speaker 1: It's very obvious that they are extremely nervous on the road.

Speaker 2: So, the more nervous the driver is, the more nervous you become as well.

Speaker 1: They should relax a bit.

Speaker 2: Do you think if the driver is more relaxed, you would feel better?

Speaker 1: Yes, because it shows they are confident in their driving habits.

Speaker 2: And that makes us confident too. But...

Speaker 1: When you drive, do you pay attention to the passengers' experience, not just today but in general?

Speaker 2: Yes, I do.

Speaker 1: What aspects do you pay attention to?

Speaker 2: I avoid sudden acceleration and sudden braking. When approaching a red light, I release the gas pedal early and brake slowly to avoid jerking. When turning or changing lanes, I do it more gently because the passengers don't have the steering wheel and don't know when the car will turn. Sudden turns can be unsettling.

Speaker 1: I understand. What else?

Speaker 2: I try to avoid potholes and manhole covers.

Speaker 1: Anything else? So, you avoid potholes and manhole covers, and you mentioned avoiding sudden braking and releasing the gas pedal early at red lights to coast through smoothly. Anything else?

Speaker 2: The temperature inside the car.

Speaker 1: Okay, let's focus on driving. Do you think about the passengers' comfort while driving? Does your driving style change significantly when you have passengers compared to when you are driving alone?

Speaker 2: Yes, I drive about 30% more gently.

Speaker 1: When you drive more gently, what does that look like?

Speaker 2: I don't rush through red lights. I prioritize safety and avoid unnecessary lane changes. When turning, I brake and slow down more gradually.

Speaker 1: When you say you brake and slow down more gradually when turning, do you mean before or during the turn?

Speaker 2: I start braking before the turn to reduce speed to a safe level before making the turn.

Speaker 1: So, you ensure the speed is low enough before turning.

Speaker 2: Yes, to avoid any sudden movements.
Speaker 1: When approaching a turn, do you brake before entering the curve?

Speaker 2: Yes, I reduce the speed to an appropriate level before turning.

Speaker 1: So, you slow down enough to ensure the passengers don't feel uncomfortable, but not too slow.

Speaker 2: Exactly, just enough so that the passengers don't feel uneasy.

Speaker 1: And when exiting the turn?

Speaker 2: I apply the accelerator gently, easing into it to make the transition smoother.

Speaker 1: Do you also turn the steering wheel more slowly when there are passengers?

Speaker 2: Yes, I turn the steering wheel more gradually and return it to the center more slowly to ensure a smoother ride.

Speaker 1: So, when you have passengers, you focus on their comfort by turning and straightening the wheel more slowly.

Speaker 2: Yes, this makes the car's movements less abrupt and more comfortable for the passengers.

Speaker 1: I understand. So, the angular speed of the car's movements is much slower. Do you have any driving habits that might make passengers uncomfortable?

Speaker 2: Yes, for example, when I rush through traffic lights. Passengers can feel very uneasy and fear a collision.

Speaker 1: So, when you rush through a light with only a few seconds left, they get nervous because of the sudden acceleration.

Speaker 2: Yes, they get very tense, especially if other cars are also trying to rush through. Also, overtaking on narrow roads makes them anxious about potential scrapes.

Speaker 1: Overtaking on narrow roads makes them nervous because they fear a collision. Why do you think they feel this way?

Speaker 2: Because my overtaking might not be very reasonable, which makes them anxious.

Speaker 1: Unreasonable overtaking?

Speaker 2: Yes, it's best to avoid overtaking on narrow roads.

Speaker 1: I agree. When you're a passenger, what driving behaviors make you uncomfortable?

Speaker 2: It's the inconsistency in using the accelerator and brake. If the driver alternates between pressing hard and lightly, it makes me feel uneasy.

Speaker 1: Alternating between pressing hard and lightly?

Speaker 2: Yes, it makes my head feel heavy and uncomfortable.

Speaker 1: Why does it make you feel uncomfortable?

Speaker 2: Because you get used to one level of pressure, and then it suddenly changes.

Speaker 1: So, you prepare yourself for the inertia, but then it changes unexpectedly.

Speaker 2: Yes, it makes the ride very tiring and uncomfortable.
Speaker 1:
So, originally you were prepared to resist the inertia, and then...

Speaker 2:
The car was very tiring, and...

Speaker 1:
And you didn't press the pedal, so...

Speaker 2:
You constantly had to feel the changes in the car's center of gravity and counteract them, which was very uncomfortable. Ideally, you should be sitting there comfortably without any issues.

Speaker 1:
Anything else?

Speaker 2:
Other drivers made me uncomfortable. Yes, yes.

Speaker 1:
Other people's driving made you uncomfortable.

Speaker 2:
Their emotions.

Speaker 1:
Like road rage?

Speaker 2:
Yes, one should drive calmly to make it more comfortable.

Speaker 1:
Anything else? No? Alright, let's continue with a video. So, this is a very important intersection on our test road because it's a four-way intersection without traffic lights. I don't know if you noticed this while driving. Let's take a look at your actions at that time. You were making a right turn, and according to your previous statement, you would look to the left. At this moment, you checked the left side of the road, then glanced at the right rearview mirror, correct? Then you looked forward again and completed the turn.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I tend to look slightly to the left just after making the turn.

Speaker 1:
Wait a moment, please reverse a bit to the right lane. You mean just after making the turn...

Speaker 2:
Yes, I pay attention to the surroundings, especially when exiting the turn.

Speaker 1:
Because you were checking the taxi, you mean the taxi...

Speaker 2:
The black car, yes.

Speaker 1:
You always check the surroundings, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, you need to be aware of all the conditions on the road.

Speaker 1:
Got it. And like you mentioned earlier, the passenger has a handle. After watching all the videos, we will review when the passenger used the handle. Are you willing to see when they used it? If you don't want to, that's fine too. Some drivers prefer not to know when the passenger felt uncomfortable.

Speaker 2:
I can watch it, no problem.

Speaker 1:
Alright, then we'll check when they used it.

Speaker 2:
Is there a school nearby?

Speaker 1:
Yes, our route passes by a primary school and a kindergarten. They are adjacent to each other.

Speaker 2:
Primary school students might have poor safety awareness and driving habits.

Speaker 1:
They tend to cross the road recklessly.

Speaker 2:
Yes, they might start crossing in the middle of the road, so I have to be very careful and sometimes use the other lane to avoid them, making sure they don't fall.

Speaker 1:
On the way back, right? Yes, on the way back. Alright, we can review that part of the drive where you made the right turn during the experiment. Oh, wait a moment, let me check that non-motorized vehicle just now...
Speaker 1:
Alright, we can take a look at the classic right turn in today's driving experiment. Oh, wait a moment, let me check that non-motorized vehicle. Was it running a red light? It should have been a red light. Regardless, it was definitely going the wrong way, right? I can only say it was definitely going the wrong way. When did you first notice it?

Speaker 2:
I noticed it quite early.

Speaker 1:
So, you noticed it at this point, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I wouldn't have turned otherwise.

Speaker 1:
At this point, you probably hadn't seen it yet. But then you saw it and immediately reacted. How did you handle the situation when you saw it coming towards you the wrong way?

Speaker 2:
I tried to stay as still as possible and reduced my speed significantly. By not moving erratically, I ensured that I wouldn't cause any issues. I let it pass by me.

Speaker 1:
So, you let it avoid you, and once it passed, you continued driving. Right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, if I had accelerated, it could have been dangerous.

Speaker 1:
There was also a pedestrian crossing the road. I noticed that you tend to yield to pedestrians, even if they are quite far away. Can I ask why?

Speaker 2:
I believe that if I don't yield, it would take them a long time to cross the road, and there's a higher risk of accidents. So, I always try to avoid these risks.

Speaker 1:
So, you usually choose to stop and let pedestrians cross, no matter the situation.

Speaker 2:
Yes, 80-98% of the time, unless the pedestrian insists on letting me go first.

Speaker 1:
If they let you go first.

Speaker 2:
Yes, if they don't move and just stand there, I would still wait for 3-5 seconds before proceeding.

Speaker 1:
So, when they see you stop, they might hurry up and cross. Now, back to the previous question. Considering passenger comfort, did you pay extra attention to any aspects during today's drive to ensure a smoother ride?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I tried to make sure they wouldn't feel any sudden movements or potential collisions. I avoided pedestrians and kept a safe distance from other vehicles. I also used the turn signals more frequently to make them feel more secure.

Speaker 1:
Using the turn signals more frequently makes passengers feel more at ease?
Speaker 1: Do you think using the turn signal more frequently makes passengers feel more at ease?

Speaker 2: Yes, because it informs them of my next move, showing that I am prepared.

Speaker 1: So, the reassurance comes from you informing other vehicles that you are about to turn, making it safer for everyone, and thus making passengers feel more secure. Or do you mean that passengers feel reassured just by hearing the turn signal?

Speaker 2: I think passengers don't think that deeply about it.

Speaker 1: Passengers don't consider it the way I described.

Speaker 2: They only notice whether I use the turn signal or not. If I use it at every intersection...

Speaker 1: Very diligently, not recklessly, and never forget to use it, they will feel safer.

Speaker 2: Exactly, if they notice I don't use the turn signal even once, they will start to worry.

Speaker 1: They will become concerned about your driving habits and might feel uneasy.

Speaker 2: Yes, they might start to distrust my driving, feeling unsafe.

Speaker 1: So, they might feel scared and think it's unsafe.

Speaker 2: On the platform, I make sure to drive safely. Personally, I have a bad habit of not always using the turn signal, but I do use it when necessary.

Speaker 1: Besides using the turn signal, have you made any other efforts to improve your driving, especially for passenger comfort?

Speaker 2: I've controlled my impulse to accelerate suddenly and have moderated my speed when braking and turning.

Speaker 1: You've slowed down a bit. Anything else?

Speaker 2: I also overtake less frequently, only when necessary.

Speaker 1: Anything else?

Speaker 2: Not really.

Speaker 1: Do you think there's anything more you can do to improve passenger comfort or any areas for improvement?

Speaker 2: I think I drove quite well today.

Speaker 1: You drove steadily, right? Nothing more to add?

Speaker 2: If you have any suggestions, I'm open to them.

Speaker 1: I'm not saying there must be something. If you think there's nothing more, that's fine. If you think you drove well, that's okay too.

Speaker 2: Yes, I think I did well today.

Speaker 1: Now, we need to make a right turn to head back. The next few questions might be a bit more challenging, so you might need to think about them a bit.
Speaker 1:
Turn the corner, and then we need to head back, make a right turn. The next few questions might be a bit more challenging than the previous ones, so you might need to think a bit before answering. Oh, look, it seems like this person is about to get into their car. Their car is on their left, and I noticed you were watching them closely.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I was observing them.

Speaker 1:
You were checking if there was enough space between the two cars for you to pass through, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I was concerned about their next move.

Speaker 1:
If either of them moved suddenly, it could be dangerous.

Speaker 2:
Exactly, if they moved even a little bit closer, I would have had to stop.

Speaker 1:
So, you need to anticipate and be prepared. Now, make a right turn into Zhongguancun Street.

Speaker 2:
Okay, but I noticed you were watching that non-automated vehicle for a long time. Why was that?

Speaker 1:
I couldn't tell if it was going straight or turning right.

Speaker 2:
Which vehicle were you unsure about, the one behind or the one in front?

Speaker 1:
The one in front had already moved, so it didn't affect my path.

Speaker 2:
I see. Now, let me ask you a question that might be a bit challenging. What do you think makes a good or professional driver? What should they at least be able to do?

Speaker 1:
First and foremost, they need to have a strong sense of safety.

Speaker 2:
What do you mean by a strong sense of safety?

Speaker 1:
Can you be more specific? What kind of awareness constitutes a strong sense of safety, and how can one ensure they have it?

Speaker 2:
They need to be observant and follow the rules. Observing and adhering to traffic rules are part of being safety-conscious.

Speaker 1:
Following the rules, like you mentioned earlier about the school kid riding a bicycle, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, it's very dangerous.

Speaker 1:
I understand. You were trying to overtake by moving to the left and honked as a warning.

Speaker 2:
I try to use my horn sparingly to keep passengers calm. Constant honking can make you seem impatient.

Speaker 1:
And this bicycle rider is also a school kid, right? He seems a bit unsteady, like he just started riding. So, you were watching him closely in case he veered left.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I was prepared to steer left to avoid him.

Speaker 1:
You were ready to give him space in case he fell.

Speaker 2:
Exactly, I was prepared to leave room for him to fall if necessary.

Speaker 1:
Now, are we turning left here, where there is no traffic light?
Speaker 1:
I started to veer left to avoid him.

Speaker 2:
You need to leave space in case he falls.

Speaker 1:
Is this a left turn or an intersection without a signal? Yes, yes, then I looked to the right before turning left, and then to the left as I approached. Now, let's get back to the previous question. We were talking about the importance of safety awareness.

Speaker 2:
Safety awareness includes the ability to observe and follow rules.

Speaker 1:
Traffic regulations, what else?

Speaker 2:
Understanding the vehicle and its performance.

Speaker 1:
Yes, understanding the vehicle's performance.

Speaker 2:
Like how the car behaves during sudden acceleration or deceleration.

Speaker 1:
Knowing what the car can and cannot do.

Speaker 2:
And the car's hardware.

Speaker 1:
What do you mean by hardware?

Speaker 2:
Things like tires, brakes, and engine issues. Being familiar with these aspects is part of safety awareness. Another important factor is driving experience. You can't call yourself a good driver with just a few thousand kilometers of experience.

Speaker 1:
So experience is crucial.

Speaker 2:
Yes, the more you drive, the more situations you encounter, and the better your reactions will be.

Speaker 1:
More options for reactions.

Speaker 2:
Yes, it's about making the right decisions in unexpected situations.

Speaker 1:
Making the right decisions.

Speaker 2:
Exactly, not just reacting impulsively.

Speaker 1:
Because you've handled similar situations before or learned from others' mistakes.

Speaker 2:
Yes, like if there's a rear-end collision ahead, do you brake or change lanes to avoid it?

Speaker 1:
Steer or brake, right.

Speaker 2:
Your experience helps you decide the best course of action.

Speaker 1:
So, you believe that mastering these aspects makes a good driver.

Speaker 2:
Yes, and considering the passengers' comfort and safety.

Speaker 1:
How can you ensure passengers feel comfortable and safe?

Speaker 2:
By following the principles we discussed.

Speaker 1:
And making sure other drivers don't see you as a hazard.

Speaker 2:
Yes, driving smoothly and predictably.

Speaker 1:
So other drivers can understand your intentions.

Speaker 2:
Exactly, and not causing issues for others on the road.

Speaker 1:
I understand. Now, let's talk about how to...
Speaker 1: I understand what you mean. I'd like to discuss this further. How can I ensure that others don't see me as a threat or a dangerous driver?

Speaker 2: The most important thing is to follow traffic rules. Secondly, make reasonable driving choices. Also, keep your emotions stable while driving.

Speaker 1: So, three main points? You also mentioned considering other drivers and not affecting their driving. How can I achieve that?

Speaker 2: Drive reasonably and avoid reckless maneuvers. Always follow traffic rules.

Speaker 1: Got it. Next question, what do you think is the biggest difference between experienced and new drivers?

Speaker 2: Experienced drivers can handle tricky situations like traffic jams or yielding to other cars more smoothly. New drivers tend to get nervous when the situation becomes complex, even if they have the skills to handle it. This nervousness can lead to mistakes.

Speaker 1: So, their actions might become erratic?

Speaker 2: Exactly, which can lead to accidents. Experience helps in maintaining a calm mindset.

Speaker 1: So, you believe the biggest difference lies in the mindset, which is influenced by the lack of experience?

Speaker 2: Yes, mainly due to insufficient experience.

Speaker 1: So, they can't stay calm?

Speaker 2: Right, they can't handle these situations well.

Speaker 1: Now, a potentially difficult question. What aspects do you think autonomous cars will never be able to match human drivers?

Speaker 2: Autonomous cars can't become exactly like human drivers.

Speaker 1: In what specific ways do you think they fall short?

Speaker 2: For example, on complex roads, humans can make unconventional choices, like navigating through narrow alleys or avoiding obstacles in ways that autonomous cars can't.

Speaker 1: You mean like driving over curbs or similar actions?

Speaker 2: Yes, an autonomous car can't do that. It can't drive on pedestrian paths because that's dangerous. If it misidentifies the road, it could easily cause an accident.
Driving on a windy road can be dangerous. For instance, if you're driving on a regular road and the system misidentifies something, it could steer you onto the sidewalk, which is very risky. That's why such a program can't be implemented.

Speaker 1:
Yes, and there are situations where flexibility is needed, but the system can't adapt. 

Speaker 2:
The logic might be lacking because it doesn't have human reasoning.

Speaker 1:
Yes, the logic is lacking.

Speaker 2:
For example, with current autonomous driving systems, when following another car, they rigidly maintain a 50-meter distance.

Speaker 1:
Yes, 50 meters.

Speaker 2:
If the car in front brakes suddenly, the autonomous car also brakes suddenly, maintaining that 50-meter distance.

Speaker 1:
It still maintains that 50 meters.

Speaker 2:
This makes passengers feel very uneasy and other drivers uncomfortable. For instance, when I'm driving on the highway, many Tesla drivers are irresponsible. They use autopilot and play with their phones, maintaining a 30-meter distance from the car in front. If the car in front brakes suddenly, the Tesla also brakes suddenly, without any anticipation, making it difficult for the car behind. This is something that can be improved.

Speaker 1:
Are there other aspects where you think autonomous driving can never match human driving? You mentioned earlier that some aspects can be improved.

Speaker 2:
Handling emergencies is another area. In case of an accident, humans have multiple ways to react. For example, if a collision is unavoidable, a human might choose to hit the guardrail or the barrier to minimize damage. 

Speaker 1:
Yes, if there's no way to avoid it, a human might choose the least damaging option.

Speaker 2:
But autonomous driving systems can't accept any collision. They can only try their best to avoid it.

Speaker 1:
Yes, they try to avoid it as much as possible. If there's no way out, they just brake hard and leave it to fate.

Speaker 2:
Yes, they can't adapt like a human would to minimize harm.

Speaker 1:
Alright, let's continue watching this video. I have two more questions, and then we'll wrap up. The first question is, how do you judge the intentions of other road users, like pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles, while driving? Let's start with pedestrians. Do you find it easy to judge their intentions?

Speaker 2:
It's relatively easy because pedestrians move slowly, giving you enough time to observe their body language.

Speaker 1:
What kind of body language do you look for?

Speaker 2:
Movements like turning their heads or changing direction.
**Speaker 1:**
When you have enough time to observe their body movements, like when they turn around, what do you think these actions mean?

**Speaker 2:**
They are checking if there are any vehicles on the main road, assessing for any danger, and preparing for their next move.

**Speaker 1:**
So, by observing these actions, you can predict what they are going to do next?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you make these predictions? I'm quite curious about this part.

**Speaker 2:**
If they are standing still, you need to be cautious because they are likely to make their next move soon. 

**Speaker 1:**
The next move could be either moving forward or preparing to cross the road, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. When you encounter pedestrians, regardless of whether they show any unusual behavior, you must always be prepared for the unexpected, like them suddenly running across the road.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you always need to be ready to stop the vehicle quickly?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, whenever you see pedestrians, you must pay close attention.

**Speaker 1:**
Besides judging a pedestrian's intentions, are there any other indicators you use?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, primarily their body movements.

**Speaker 1:**
By body movements, you mean actions like turning around?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
What does it mean if they are moving quickly?

**Speaker 2:**
It means you might not have enough time to react, so you need to be extra careful.

**Speaker 1:**
And if they are moving slowly?

**Speaker 2:**
If they slow down, they might be preparing to cross the road or make some other adjustment.

**Speaker 1:**
What about non-motorized vehicles? Are they easier to predict?

**Speaker 2:**
Non-motorized vehicles are harder to predict than pedestrians because they move faster. If the rider has poor safety awareness, it’s difficult to judge when they might turn or stop since they often don’t look back or check their mirrors.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you usually judge the intentions of non-motorized vehicles while driving?

**Speaker 2:**
I mainly rely on braking and observing if they look back or check their mirrors.

**Speaker 1:**
What if they brake?

**Speaker 2:**
If they brake, it likely means they are checking for traffic and might be preparing to cross the road.

**Speaker 1:**
What if they don’t brake? I’ve noticed many delivery riders don’t stop at red lights or check for traffic. What should you do then?

**Speaker 2:**
In that case, you need to observe both sides of the road. Pedestrians are usually on the right side, so you should check if there are any openings or intersections they might use. If there’s a median strip, it’s less likely they will cross. However, if there are vendors or intersections on both sides, you need to be extra cautious as they might be heading to another location. If the middle area doesn’t allow for crossing, you can be a bit more relaxed since the likelihood of them crossing is low.
Speaker 1: If there's an intersection, you need to be extra cautious. The other person might be heading somewhere else. If they don't have the conditions to cross, you can slow down a bit because the likelihood of them crossing is low.

Speaker 2: It's not just about speed; it's also about the surrounding environment.

Speaker 1: The surrounding environment.

Speaker 2: Whether there's an intersection that makes it easier for them to cross.

Speaker 1: I understand. So, you judge their intention based on the conditions around the intersection to see if they intend to cross.

Speaker 2: If the conditions aren't right, they probably won't cross. The chances are very low.

Speaker 1: Are there other ways to determine the intention of a non-motorized vehicle?

Speaker 2: You can look at the driver of the non-motorized vehicle.

Speaker 1: Look at the driver directly?

Speaker 2: Yes, see if they turn their head or put their foot on the ground.

Speaker 1: If they put their foot on the ground.

Speaker 2: It indicates they might stop to observe. Anything else for non-motorized vehicles?

Speaker 1: No, that's about it.

Speaker 2: What about motorized vehicles? Do you think their intentions are easier to judge?

Speaker 1: Motorized vehicles are relatively easier to judge because they have turn signals and brake lights.

Speaker 2: Yes, but if we ignore turn signals and brake lights, how would you judge the intention of a non-motorized vehicle?

Speaker 1: By their lane changes.

Speaker 2: For example, if you're both driving straight and they slowly move to the left or right.

Speaker 1: If their wheels start to cross the lane line.

Speaker 2: They might be preparing to change lanes.

Speaker 1: Or if they honk or flash their lights.

Speaker 2: Yes, that could mean they have an immediate intention to overtake or are in a hurry. Anything else?

Speaker 1: Accelerating or decelerating.

Speaker 2: What can you tell from accelerating or decelerating?

Speaker 1: If they accelerate, it means they want to get through that section quickly, possibly choosing a less congested area to change lanes. If they decelerate, they might have encountered a situation.

Speaker 2: They might miss or pass by something.

Speaker 1: They might quickly change lanes or stop suddenly.

Speaker 2: Understood. One last question: imagine a scenario where you're at an intersection without traffic lights, and you need to cross. At the same time, a pedestrian also needs to cross. You both see each other and hesitate, fearing a collision. You both stop, then decide to move forward at the same time, causing a conflict. What would you do in this situation?

Speaker 1: I would signal to the pedestrian to go ahead.
**Speaker 1:** You both moved forward at the same time, causing a conflict. In such a situation, what would you do?

**Speaker 2:** I would signal to the pedestrian.

**Speaker 1:** How would you signal to the pedestrian? Would you open the window and use a gesture? Could you show me? Would you use your left hand or right hand? Does it depend on which side they are coming from?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it depends on which side they are coming from. It's a polite gesture to let them go.

**Speaker 1:** What kind of polite gesture?

**Speaker 2:** For example, avoid pointing directly at them. Use your palm instead.

**Speaker 1:** Use your palm?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, indicate the direction they should go with your palm, or if they can hear you, open the window and speak to them.

**Speaker 1:** So, you would open the window and say something like "You go first"? I understand.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I would avoid competing with pedestrians for the right of way because they are more vulnerable. If an accident happens, it would be more serious for them.

**Speaker 1:** Understood. After that, you would immediately move to the left lane. I don't have any more questions. We've covered everything. Let's review the data from the handle.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, so I have to get...

**Speaker 1:** The eye movement starts precisely at 3:30 PM, 15 minutes and 39 seconds into the recording. Is that correct? At 39 seconds, you were at the U-turn point. Let me finish watching this part. The entire video is 7 minutes long.

**Speaker 2:** What happened today? 17...

**Speaker 1:** Yes, it started at 3:30 PM. No problem. During the U-turn...

**Speaker 2:** Did you press it now?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, at this segment.

**Speaker 2:** There was no entry at that time.

**Speaker 1:** We can pinpoint it to within a minute.

**Speaker 1:** After 200 meters, turn right. You mentioned 17 minutes...

**Speaker 2:** I didn't see that part.

**Speaker 1:** Let's check. At 17 minutes, it was about to turn right. At 17 minutes and 9 seconds, did you press it?

**Speaker 2:** I should have been reversing at that time, then driving forward.

**Speaker 1:** No, no. Around 17:30, did you park on the left side? At 80, you felt uncomfortable parking.

**Speaker 2:** At 17 minutes and 9 seconds, I had already parked.

**Speaker 1:** No problem. Are you referring to 3:17 or 3 minutes? It doesn't matter. It might have been when you were returning. That segment is not part of our experimental route. After the U-turn, our experimental route ends.

**Speaker 2:** So, you didn't press it on the way back, right?

**Speaker 1:** Correct. The experiment is now complete. Please fill out this form.

**Speaker 1:** I'll close the Tencent meeting now.
