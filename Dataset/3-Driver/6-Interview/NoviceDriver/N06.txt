**Speaker 1:**
How do you do it? You need to turn this off. This one? Then import it here, and once it's imported, you're good to go.

**Speaker 1:**
Let's test the microphone. I'll turn on the subtitles and transcription. Oh, wait, okay, now you can speak.

**Speaker 1:**
No Handa with VPN? Got it.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you see the screen? Yes, you can. It looks very professional, like this.

**Speaker 2:**
Are you sure you didn't open the wrong one?

**Speaker 1:**
Why is it orange?

**Speaker 2:**
For my license support, the collapse.

**Speaker 2:**
Did you see it on the blue desktop?

**Speaker 1:**
I'm here with a Tencent meeting and another team member. This software is having some issues; it keeps crashing.

**Speaker 2:**
Hold on a moment. Let's try restarting.

**Speaker 1:**
The whole system? I plan to create a new project and then try again.

**Speaker 2:**
Please wait a moment, driver. Sometimes there are minor issues, but it's not a big problem.

**Speaker 2:**
Quality beauty products.

**Speaker 1:**
Let's test the microphone again. Just speak when you're connected. Yes, yes, can you hear me? It's a bit faint.

**Speaker 2:**
Closer to me.

**Speaker 1:**
A bit closer, is this better? Please say something.

**Speaker 2:**
Can you hear me? How's the volume?

**Speaker 1:**
Tencent meeting transcription. Yes, you can see the part where you just spoke below.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I can hear it. I can hear it.

**Speaker 1:**
Once our video import is complete, we will officially start our interview. I'll enlarge this a bit for you.

**Speaker 1:**
You can hear the sound, which means it's about to...

**Speaker 2:**
Turn left.

**Speaker 1:**
Then you can see the red focus point, which is where you were looking at the time. I'll find a spot to exit the parking lot, and then we'll start our interview.

**Speaker 2:**
Can I export this later?

**Speaker 1:**
The source file? I might need to check if that's possible. The source file?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the eye-tracking record. It might not be possible for now, but we can discuss it after the interview due to data confidentiality.

**Speaker 1:**
Thank you. I'll start the interview now. Let me introduce myself; my name is Chang Xiang, and I will be responsible for the final part of the interview today. We will watch the eye-tracking video recorded during your experiment. We will explore your driving habits together, and we can pause and discuss interesting points at any time. Don't worry, you can stop me whenever you find something noteworthy.
Speaker 1:
Alright, so at any interesting points, we can pause and discuss. You can say whatever you want, don't worry about it. If I find something interesting, I'll pause too, and we can discuss it. Just like a regular conversation, if any of my questions feel too sensitive and you don't want to answer, just let me know, and I won't push.

Speaker 1:
All the data we collect will be anonymized. We're only converting speech to text, no video recording or anything like that. So, thank you again for supporting our experiment. I'll start with some simple questions. What types of cars have you driven? For example, SUVs, sedans, off-road vehicles, gasoline cars, electric cars, etc.

Speaker 2:
I've driven sedans, gasoline cars, and electric cars. Basically, everything except commercial vehicles.

Speaker 1:
By commercial vehicles, you mean MPVs, right? Okay, which type do you drive the most?

Speaker 2:
Mostly sedans.

Speaker 1:
So, are you comfortable with the car we're using today? You mentioned you've driven electric cars before. Was that for a test drive or personal use?

Speaker 2:
For personal use.

Speaker 1:
Did you rent it?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I rented it.

Speaker 1:
Have any of the cars you've driven had driver assistance features?

Speaker 2:
Yes, like ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control).

Speaker 1:
Have you used it?

Speaker 2:
No, but the car had it. I've mainly used cruise control.

Speaker 1:
Which car was that?

Speaker 2:
BYD E2.

Speaker 1:
How did you find the cruise control feature on the BYD E2?

Speaker 2:
It was helpful. It reduced the effort required for driving.

Speaker 1:
Did you use it on the highway? Was it useful?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I found it useful.

Speaker 1:
It gave you a break, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, it relieved some of the strain on my hands and reduced head fatigue.

Speaker 1:
Do you usually drive more short distances or long distances in the city?

Speaker 2:
Mostly short distances in the city. I don't drive long distances in the city often.

Speaker 1:
So, you drive more long distances for trips outside the city. How do you feel about the car you're driving today? Any discomfort that affects your driving?

Speaker 2:
No, I feel quite comfortable.
Interviewer: How was your driving experience today? Did you find anything uncomfortable that might have affected your driving?

Driver: No, not really. It felt quite normal, similar to my usual driving habits.

Interviewer: Have you ever been involved in a traffic accident?

Driver: Yes, I have.

Interviewer: Could you share more about that?

Driver: Sure. There were two main types of accidents. One was a rear-end collision where another car hit me from behind. The other was due to my own driving error. For example, once I was driving on a mountain road in the rain. I was driving a bit fast and using one hand because my right hand was shifting gears. The road was wet on one side, and suddenly the front wheels lost traction. The rear wheels then lost grip, causing the car to skid and veer into the opposite lane. I tried to correct it, but it was too late. So, one was a rear-end collision, and the other was my own mistake on a mountain road.

Interviewer: How did these accidents affect your driving habits?

Driver: They had a significant impact. For instance, after being rear-ended, I now frequently check my rearview mirror to monitor the behavior of cars behind me. I pay special attention to see if they are not paying attention to the road ahead. After the mountain road incident, I make sure to stay focused and use both hands when driving in such conditions.

Interviewer: I see. So, these experiences have made you more cautious. Now, let's review the footage of your driving today. I'll pause the video at certain points, like at intersections or when making U-turns, and ask about your usual driving habits. Then we'll see if your actions today match what you described. If there are any discrepancies, we can discuss the reasons behind them.
Speaker 1:
After we finish, we'll review the video to see if your actions today align with your usual driving habits. If they don't, we'll try to understand why. This is the general process. When we left the parking lot, the first thing we encountered was merging onto the auxiliary road. Could you describe your usual driving habits when making a turn?

Speaker 2:
When turning, I first observe the main road based on the direction of the turn.

Speaker 1:
Let's start with right turns since we initially encountered several consecutive right turns.

Speaker 2:
For right turns, I slow down as I approach the intersection and observe the main road. Regardless of whether it's a rear-view mirror or directly through the window, I check for any incoming traffic.

Speaker 1:
So, you lower the car window to observe. You first look to the left, correct?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I confirm there are no obstacles or that any obstacles won't reach me quickly. I also observe other road users to understand their intentions before focusing on the turning process, usually towards the inner side of the turn.

Speaker 1:
By the inner side, you mean the right side? Do you use the right car window or the right rear-view mirror?

Speaker 2:
Mainly the right car window.

Speaker 1:
What do you primarily observe on the right side?

Speaker 2:
I observe the shoulder of the road, for instance, the position of my car relative to the shoulder, especially when my car's front is turning.

Speaker 1:
Understood. Do you also check for other traffic participants on the right side?

Speaker 2:
Yes, because that area can have other traffic participants.

Speaker 1:
Who are these traffic participants?

Speaker 2:
Pedestrians, non-motorized vehicles, etc.

Speaker 1:
Do you particularly focus on any specific type of participant? Are the objects of your observation on the left and right sides the same?

Speaker 2:
There are differences. On the left side, I mainly observe other vehicles and not pedestrians because my speed entering the right turn is usually faster than that of pedestrians. Pedestrians typically react to me, so I am more proactive. On the right side, I focus more on pedestrians because my car's rear might have a smaller turning radius than the front.

Speaker 1:
So, you ensure that the rear of your car avoids the path of crossing pedestrians. Do you move the car forward a bit more before turning the wheel? At what position do you usually start turning? Typically, there is a stop line before the turn. Do you have an idea of where your right rear wheel is when you start turning?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I also use the right rear-view mirror to check.
**Speaker 1:**
When you approach the lane line, where approximately does your right rear wheel end up before you start turning the steering wheel? Do you have a reference point you use from the right side mirror to gauge your position?

**Speaker 2:**
I usually gauge it by the position of my foot. When my heel crosses the stop line, that's when I start turning.

**Speaker 1:**
So, after crossing the stop line, you begin your right turn. Got it. Now, let's talk about the actual maneuver. Can you describe the extent of your steering wheel rotation, the speed at which you turn the wheel, and how you return it to the neutral position?

**Speaker 2:**
The extent of the turn depends on the car's trajectory and the expected path.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you elaborate?

**Speaker 2:**
If the car's trajectory is wider than expected, meaning the path hasn't narrowed as anticipated, then you need to turn the wheel more.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you need to turn the wheel more in such cases.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. In terms of force and speed, I usually start with a medium to high turning speed. When returning the wheel to the neutral position, I prefer to do it gradually and slowly.

**Speaker 1:**
When you return the steering wheel, do you actively turn it back yourself, or do you let the wheel return on its own?

**Speaker 2:**
I usually let the wheel return on its own.

**Speaker 1:**
Understood. Now, let's discuss braking and accelerating. Can you describe your approach to these operations?

**Speaker 2:**
For braking, I generally build up pressure gradually until I reach the peak, then maintain it before slowly releasing.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you build up pressure gradually?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, to feel the grip of the front wheels and ensure they are responding as expected. If the pressure reaches my expected peak, I maintain it and then gradually increase it.

**Speaker 1:**
So, building pressure is a gradual process?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it involves a bit of testing initially to gauge the response.

**Speaker 1:**
You apply pressure to a certain level and then gradually increase it?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, until I reach a steady deceleration rate, then I maintain it and slowly release.

**Speaker 1:**
What if the initial pressure exceeds your expectation?

**Speaker 2:**
If I press down and the pressure is too high initially, I release slightly to reduce the pressure but not completely. It's a matter of testing and adjusting to find the right balance.
Speaker 1: When you release the brake, you do it gradually to reduce pressure, but you don't release it completely. Initially, there's a bit of a test. If you find the braking pressure is strong, you slowly ease off, but maintain a certain level.

Speaker 2: Yes, after reaching the peak, I gradually release the brake. It's not a quick release; it's done slowly.

Speaker 1: I understand. The accelerator works similarly, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, with the accelerator, there's also an initial test. Then, I quickly reach my expected peak and stabilize.

Speaker 1: It could go up or down. Generally, I reach an expected level, stabilize for a while, and then adjust as needed.

Speaker 2: Yes, then I stabilize at another appropriate level.

Speaker 1: Let's review your driving today. I want to confirm something. The eye-tracking data shows where you were actually looking. Do you remember if it was accurate?

Speaker 2: What do you mean by accurate?

Speaker 1: Were you actually looking at the spot indicated, or was it higher?

Speaker 2: I was looking at the small flag behind the car, at the top.

Speaker 1: So, at that height. Got it. There might be a slight discrepancy because of calibration.

Speaker 1: You were observing the left side from that position, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, because the view was better. When the view ahead is poor, I don't focus on the left side.

Speaker 1: You don't continuously check the left side, especially when following another car.

Speaker 2: Correct, I focus on the front. After passing the stop line, I check the left side.

Speaker 1: Today, I noticed you didn't check the right side as you described. Is that correct?

Speaker 2: Yes, I use a static check for the right side. I don't worry much because I have a good grasp of the right-side environment.

Speaker 1: When the taxi cut in front of you from the left, how did you handle it?

Speaker 2: I stopped first.
**Speaker 1:** At that moment, did the taxi cut in front of you from the left side?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, from the left front. 

**Speaker 1:** How did you handle the situation?

**Speaker 2:** First, I stopped to observe its intentions, whether it was going to yield or continue.

**Speaker 1:** After observing, how did you determine its intentions?

**Speaker 2:** I checked if it was maintaining its speed or if it was slowing down. If it showed signs of stopping, I would proceed cautiously.

**Speaker 1:** So, you observed that it was stopping?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it stopped.

**Speaker 1:** Even if you had the right of way, you still judged its intentions and yielded if necessary?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, if it seemed unaware of me and continued at the same speed, I would definitely yield.

**Speaker 1:** In more complex scenarios with many non-motorized vehicles, how do you handle it?

**Speaker 2:** Generally, I give them the right of way. I allow non-motorized vehicles to pass first.

**Speaker 1:** By giving them the right of way, you mean?

**Speaker 2:** Letting them go first, especially in narrow spaces.

**Speaker 1:** So, you slow down?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, and if we are moving parallel, I ensure there is enough distance between us.

**Speaker 1:** Do you deliberately move to the left?

**Speaker 2:** I also pay attention to whether they are aware of vehicles in the left lane. If they are switching between non-motorized and motorized lanes, I choose to pass quickly. If they are aware of the left lane, they won't drift into my path, and I can pass more confidently.

**Speaker 1:** I noticed you adjusted your car to the right. Why did you do that?

**Speaker 2:** A few seconds before, I was slightly off-center in the lane. When I reached a normal driving speed, I preferred to return to the center of the lane.

**Speaker 1:** Ahead, there was a merging point from a side road to the main road. Can you tell me about your usual driving habits?

**Speaker 2:** I usually signal first, then observe the surroundings and proceed gradually, or sometimes I directly turn my head to check.

**Speaker 1:** Which method do you prefer for observing?
**Speaker 1:** Do you have a specific driving habit?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I usually start by signaling, then I observe the surroundings effectively and progressively. Sometimes, I just turn my head to check.

**Speaker 1:** Which method do you prefer: using your rearview mirror or directly turning your head to check? Turning your head is often a substitute when the rearview mirror doesn't provide a good view. Or do you use both methods simultaneously?

**Speaker 2:** I usually focus on the rearview mirror first. It's a matter of sequence. I check the rearview mirror until I reach the entry point, and then I turn my head to check.

**Speaker 1:** So, before entering the entry point, you rely on the rearview mirror, and after entering, you turn your head to check?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, but it also depends on the road conditions. Sometimes, the situation requires a different approach.

**Speaker 1:** Why do you stop using the rearview mirror when merging into the entry point?

**Speaker 2:** Because of blind spots. When the car deviates, you can only see in the direction you're heading.

**Speaker 1:** It's hard to see clearly because it's not a straight line; it's at an angle relative to your car.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, when merging into the main road from the left front, the trajectory can shift slightly downward.

**Speaker 1:** So, you were looking at the rearview mirror but couldn't see the main road clearly?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I was looking at the rearview mirror.

**Speaker 1:** I understand. You realized the rearview mirror didn't provide a clear view of the main road.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, and I remember a car suddenly appeared from my left side.

**Speaker 1:** So, you didn't see that car initially?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it was a blind spot.

**Speaker 1:** At that moment, the rearview mirror showed a bit of the main road, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, but the sides were still blind spots.

**Speaker 1:** I see. You were startled at that moment, weren't you?

**Speaker 2:** I was a bit surprised, but not too much.

**Speaker 1:** Not too much?

**Speaker 2:** Just a bit surprised that I didn't see the car.

**Speaker 1:** Do you remember the time?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it was around 6 minutes and 33 seconds.

**Speaker 1:** How did you handle the situation?

**Speaker 2:** I turned the steering wheel to the right. I also released the accelerator to let the car coast.

**Speaker 1:** Did you brake?

**Speaker 2:** No, I didn't brake. The other car was moving faster, so braking wouldn't have been effective and might have caused discomfort.
**Speaker 1:** Why didn't you try to brake at that moment?

**Speaker 2:** The other car was moving faster than me, and I realized that braking wouldn't be very effective. In fact, it might have compromised comfort.

**Speaker 1:** Not very effective, right.

**Speaker 2:** Exactly. The car was already speeding past me, so braking suddenly wouldn't have helped.

**Speaker 1:** It would have been too late.

**Speaker 2:** If a collision were to happen, braking at that point wouldn't have made a difference. Moving your foot to the brake pedal takes time. So, it's more important to steer away.

**Speaker 1:** Steering would be quicker.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:** Avoiding the car is more important than braking. Steering doesn't affect comfort as much as sudden braking does. A sudden brake would have a significant impact on comfort and wouldn't stop the car immediately. At that distance, braking wouldn't have prevented a collision. It would have been too late. How do you judge that distance?

**Speaker 2:** The lateral distance wouldn't change much in that short time. The relative speed was high, and the other car would have passed quickly. Any reaction within that short time wouldn't have been effective. So, instead of braking, I chose to steer.

**Speaker 1:** Right.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, for example...

**Speaker 1:** Once you see the situation, the time to react is very short.

**Speaker 2:** Steering is the quickest response. Whether it's the accelerator or the brake, by the time you react, the situation has already changed. So, steering is the only option.

**Speaker 1:** So, you think steering is faster than braking?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it's faster. It affects the car's position more quickly and my hand reaction is faster than moving my foot to the brake.

**Speaker 1:** Both factors, hand reaction and car position, are faster.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, both.

**Speaker 1:** When driving in a straight line, what are your habits?

**Speaker 2:** I usually scan the three mirrors every few seconds.

**Speaker 1:** The side mirrors and the rearview mirror. Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** I might also look at the scenery if traffic is light.

**Speaker 1:** Do you keep the car in the middle of the lane, or do you tend to stay to the left or right?

**Speaker 2:** Mostly in the middle, but sometimes slightly to the right.

**Speaker 1:** Why do you sometimes stay to the right?

**Speaker 2:** It's not related to the left-hand drive perspective.

**Speaker 1:** So, it's not about the seating position?

**Speaker 2:** No, it's more about...
**Speaker 1:** The reason for veering to the right occasionally is due to the left-hand drive perspective.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it's not really related to the seat position. It's more about...

**Speaker 1:** Traffic rules. Right, you tend to veer more to the right.

**Speaker 2:** Exactly. For instance, at this intersection, I know I need to make a U-turn. So, while driving straight, I already consider this.

**Speaker 1:** So, you would move slightly to the left or right to leave space on the left.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. This way, when I need to adjust for the U-turn, I don't have to pull the car all the way to the right. I start preparing early.

**Speaker 1:** So, you start considering the U-turn about 400-500 meters in advance, keeping the car slightly to the right. What speed do you usually maintain? You can differentiate based on different types of roads.

**Speaker 2:** Actually, I don't focus on the speed itself. I pay more attention to the throttle position. I tend to keep a constant throttle.

**Speaker 1:** By constant throttle, you mean maintaining a throttle position that overcomes the current speed's resistance, keeping the speed within a stable range.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, and there's a gradual acceleration process. Once it reaches the desired acceleration, the throttle position is very low. Unless there's a special situation, I would maintain a constant throttle.

**Speaker 1:** So, you don't pay much attention to the current speed on the dashboard?

**Speaker 2:** I see the speed as a reference, but it doesn't influence my decisions. It's just for my understanding.

**Speaker 1:** So, your sense of speed mainly comes from the dynamics in your field of vision?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, or from my sense of acceleration.

**Speaker 1:** Got it. What about your preferred following distance?

**Speaker 2:** When cruising, I maintain a distance based on the speed. 

**Speaker 1:** Yes, there's always a distance to the car in front.

**Speaker 2:** And as the speed increases, the distance also increases.

**Speaker 1:** Right, there are two main factors at play here. If you have any additional thoughts, feel free to add them.

**Speaker 2:** Approaching the classic turn, about 10 meters to the U-turn.

**Speaker 1:** Your eye movement is quite high, scanning the surroundings. As you mentioned, you occasionally glance to the left when entering the main road. You quickly check the left side, and you can see the red line trajectory. It's a gradual adjustment for the U-turn.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly.
Speaker 1:
When you see the red line trajectory, it should be there. Basically, it’s slowly moving, actually at a U-turn spot. Okay, let's describe your usual habits when making a U-turn. I already know that you tend to move to the right in advance to create a larger turning space. Besides that, what else do you do?

Speaker 2:
Well, when I complete the U-turn, it’s similar to making a turn. But, the main focus during a U-turn is on the direction you’re turning into. You need to scan the area. Yes, I usually check the rearview mirror before making a U-turn.

Speaker 1:
And when you’re about to complete the U-turn, you check the rearview mirror again?

Speaker 2:
Yes, and I also turn my head to look through the left rear window and the left side window.

Speaker 1:
So, you first check the left and rear, rather than the front traffic?

Speaker 2:
Yes, because I’ve been monitoring the oncoming traffic before making the U-turn, so I consider it a stable situation.

Speaker 1:
Do you check the left and rear before or after you start turning the wheel?

Speaker 2:
Before turning the wheel, I check, then I start turning. Are there any other actions you take, like with the steering, brakes, or accelerator?

Speaker 1:
No special actions, just slowing down.

Speaker 2:
Even if there are no special actions, can you describe the process?

Speaker 1:
I slow down, gradually release the brake to let the car glide, then start turning the wheel. Once I confirm the trajectory is clear, I proceed slowly.

Speaker 2:
How do you determine if the trajectory is clear?

Speaker 1:
That comes with experience.

Speaker 2:
I remember during my first test drive, you hesitated a bit about whether the car could make it through a tight spot. You asked me, but I didn’t respond, and you figured out it could make it.

Speaker 1:
Yes.

Speaker 2:
So, I want to ask in detail, how did you make that judgment?

Speaker 1:
When faced with uncertainty, I weigh the risks and benefits. If I can make the turn, I don’t need to adjust again, which is the benefit. If I can’t, the biggest risk is hitting the curb. But in that specific situation, the opposite lane had a green belt and the curb was narrow, so I judged that...

Speaker 2:
The car’s chassis would clear the small curb.

Speaker 1:
Yes, so even if I couldn’t make the turn, only the wheel hub would be affected.
Speaker 1:
The chassis will ride over the small ledge of the roadbed.

Speaker 2:
Yes, so I judged that even if I couldn't make it, it would just be the wheel hub lightly touching.

Speaker 1:
Not the body of the car?

Speaker 2:
Yes, the body of the car. This is a special situation.

Speaker 1:
So, when you observe and judge whether it can pass, what do you use as a reference?

Speaker 2:
I definitely look at the lower right corner of the car, the closest point to the right front.

Speaker 1:
Alright, we can check that later. You mentioned releasing the brake and using idle speed to pass. When do you step on the accelerator to return to normal driving speed?

Speaker 2:
When the turning speed is within my expected range, and I notice the car's body turning faster and the road getting narrower, I will gradually accelerate. If the turning speed meets or exceeds my expectations, I know I can accelerate.

Speaker 1:
I understand. So, after you determine that the trajectory won't hit the roadside, and if the turning radius is smaller than expected, you will confidently step on the accelerator to speed up the turn. Your description of accelerating matches the documentation you mentioned earlier, where you start with a test and gradually reach your expected speed.

Speaker 1:
So, before making a U-turn, you observe the traffic flow. You scan the area within 10 meters.

Speaker 2:
Yes, because it can be boring, so I keep scanning.

Speaker 1:
Are you looking at the scenery or the rearview mirror?

Speaker 2:
I'm checking if there are any fast cars in the right lane because I'm positioned on the right side of the lane. If the light is green, I've encountered situations where a car might hit my rearview mirror.

Speaker 1:
You've had that happen before?

Speaker 2:
Yes, while waiting to make a U-turn, a car going straight at a green light hit my rearview mirror.

Speaker 1:
Did it break?

Speaker 2:
Not exactly, the mirror has some flexibility. It was just a scrape, but I pay attention to it.

Speaker 1:
So, you adjust your position to the right to avoid the boundary line.
**Speaker 1:**
But that issue isn't significant. Yes, but it did graze, so I will pay attention.

**Speaker 1:**
Then here, you should adjust to the right again. Why do you keep moving closer to the boundary line?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, yes, to give myself more space. And now, because I noticed the other car is aware of me, I feel more at ease.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you observe the intentions of the cars in the other lane? Did you notice they were aware of you?

**Speaker 2:**
The other lane? Or do you mean my own lane?

**Speaker 1:**
You just mentioned that you confirmed the other car noticed you. How did you do that?

**Speaker 2:**
Are you asking if the other car noticed me, or if I was helping them execute a maneuver?

**Speaker 1:**
Which lane? Who did you say noticed you?

**Speaker 2:**
I observed the car in the right lane. I noticed it was not too close to my car.

**Speaker 1:**
So, they also adjusted their position, ensuring they knew you were going to make a U-turn and moved to the right to give you space. How did you determine that?

**Speaker 2:**
By observing the position of their car relative to the road markings.

**Speaker 2:**
About 10 meters ahead, I merged into the main road.

**Speaker 1:**
At this point, you started to turn the steering wheel, instead of checking the rear and left side first. Why?

**Speaker 2:**
Because it's a one-way street, so checking behind isn't necessary. We only need to focus on the oncoming traffic. Also, it was a red light, so I knew there was no traffic interference.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you pay attention to pedestrians at this point, especially those on the crosswalk?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I checked for any pedestrians who might be crossing against the light.

**Speaker 1:**
But theoretically, they shouldn't affect you, so your observation was just a precaution?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it's part of my process. I had some extra time and attention, so I focused on the right lower corner.

**Speaker 1:**
Which specific area did you look at? It seems a bit off.

**Speaker 2:**
You should focus on the area with the most activity or the most critical point.

**Speaker 1:**
I can't see where you're pointing. Can you clarify?

**Speaker 2:**
You should look at the peak activity area or the densest spot, not elsewhere.

**Speaker 1:**
Move to this spot.

**Speaker 2:**
Now, my coordination level should be here.

**Speaker 1:**
On the black and white line of the car.

**Speaker 1:**
Or, Tom, actually you...
Speaker 2:
I moved to this place.

Speaker 1:
So, at this point, your coordination level should be around here.

Speaker 1:
In the car, this car has a black and white line. On top.

Speaker 1:
Or, Tom, you mentioned earlier that we need to ask about this. After making a U-turn, the speed is relatively slow, and you need to quickly accelerate to the main road's driving speed. I want to ask, during this straight-line acceleration, what is your usual habit? It doesn't necessarily have to be after a U-turn, just your general acceleration habit.

Speaker 2:
Well, I consider my passengers a lot. If I'm alone, I might accelerate faster, even aggressively. But if I have passengers, I try to make the acceleration smoother and more comfortable for them.

Speaker 1:
So, when you're alone, your logic is different from when you have passengers.

Speaker 2:
Yes, when I'm alone, I tend to drive faster. I usually keep the throttle steady, almost fully open, until I reach a speed I feel is appropriate. Then I might ease off the throttle a bit.

Speaker 1:
During straight-line acceleration, besides the throttle, is there anything else you focus on? Or is it similar to regular driving in terms of observation?

Speaker 2:
The observation is the same, but I scan more frequently.

Speaker 1:
You scan more frequently. And here...

Speaker 2:
350 meters to the destination.

Speaker 1:
Now, you’ve almost reached your expected speed, right?

Speaker 2:
Not quite. From the video, I might choose to accelerate more because I know the U-turn point is past the bus stop.

Speaker 1:
Maybe because the camera angle is slightly different from your actual view.

Speaker 2:
Now, my speed has reached its peak.

Speaker 1:
About to reach, maybe now it's at the peak. In 40 meters, turn right. Earlier, it might have been 5 km/h slower.

Speaker 2:
Near the destination, turn right in 40 meters.

Speaker 1:
So, when you checked the right mirror earlier, was it part of your scanning, or were you intentionally checking it for the right turn?

Speaker 2:
I was intentionally checking for the right turn.

Speaker 1:
To confirm if there were any non-motorized vehicles or pedestrians at the intersection, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, to see if there were any gaps or obstacles.
Speaker 1: From the eye-tracking video, it seems like you couldn't see anything, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, that's correct. I was trying to see if there were any gaps in the traffic or if there were any taller vehicles within the last 40 meters before making a right turn.

Speaker 1: So, during the turn, you didn't see anything, but you also didn't deliberately check the right rear window or the right side mirror?

Speaker 2: Correct. At that point, it wouldn't have been beneficial because my car's front end was already in the turn. Even if I turned my head to look, the vehicles in the bike lane would still be in my blind spot. By the time my car's front end passed the green belt, looking wouldn't provide any benefit.

Speaker 1: So, you were looking ahead because you knew you couldn't see anything, so you didn't bother to look back?

Speaker 2: Yes. When entering the turn, I might have glanced at the side mirror, but it wouldn't have shown anything useful.

Speaker 1: I understand. You glanced at the side mirror, but it didn't show anything.

Speaker 2: Exactly. My car's front end was already in the turn, so even if I looked to the right, it wouldn't help. If there was something I didn't notice and I hit it, looking wouldn't change that. So, I didn't look. Also, there was a car in front of me, which helped.

Speaker 1: The car in front helped to clear the way for you?

Speaker 2: Yes, exactly. The car in front had already entered the turn, so I expected that any non-motorized vehicles would see it and wait for both of us to pass before crossing.

Speaker 1: Like a train with cars attached, they would wait for both of you to pass before crossing?

Speaker 2: Yes, I think if someone was waiting, they would wait for both cars to pass.

Speaker 1: So, for these reasons, you didn't check the right side mirror during the turn?

Speaker 2: Yes, basically, I didn't check the right side mirror.

Speaker 1: If there wasn't a car in front of you, would you have been more cautious?

Speaker 2: Yes, I would have been very careful.

Speaker 1: Can I ask if you overtook any vehicles during the formal experiment?

Speaker 2: I don't remember. We would need to check the records. I don't recall overtaking any vehicles.

Speaker 1: You don't recall overtaking any vehicles?

Speaker 2: Unless the car on the right was slowing down.

Speaker 1: I understand. Could you describe your driving habits, especially regarding overtaking and changing lanes?

Speaker 2: Overtaking involves judging the intention of the car in front.

Speaker 1: Judging the intention of the car you want to overtake?

Speaker 2: Yes, judging whether the driver is distracted, using their phone, looking at a map, unsure of where to go, wanting to park, or planning to make a U-turn. It's about understanding their intention.
Interviewer: Was the driver distracted, using their phone, or looking at a map? Did they not know where they were going? Did they want to park or make a U-turn? How do you judge their intentions?

Driver: If the car in front is stopping and starting, you should start paying attention early. If you notice the brake lights coming on and off, you might think they are looking for something. They might be copying an address or making a sudden turn. If the car in front suddenly stops, I would assume they want to park or make a U-turn, and then I would decide whether to overtake. But if the driver is using their phone, the brake lights won't come on.

Interviewer: They might just be coasting, right? They are just letting off the gas.

Driver: Yes, they are just coasting. You can observe that their speed is gradually decreasing or staying at a slow pace.

Interviewer: So, you wouldn't overtake in that situation because you think the driver might be maintaining their speed?

Driver: Yes, I would follow for a while to confirm their intentions. I would observe their behavior to see if they are using their phone or doing something else.

Interviewer: How would you observe them during this time? If you are directly behind them, you can't see their face.

Driver: I would offset a bit to the left because overtaking is usually done from the left. I would move to the left to observe the car in front.

Interviewer: If they don't react to you, would you overtake?

Driver: Yes, I would overtake if they don't react. If they move slightly to the right or if their brake lights come on, I would assume they are aware of me.

Interviewer: Besides the car in front, do you pay attention to anything else?

Driver: Yes, I look at the surroundings. For example, if the car in front is moving slowly near a school or kindergarten, I would expect them to stop because of pedestrians. I wouldn't overtake in such situations.

Interviewer: So, you wouldn't overtake in those scenarios?

Driver: It depends on the specific situation. For example, if there is a bus stop and a car is slowing down, I would assume there might be passengers getting on or off. I would keep a safe distance.

Interviewer: What about on a ring road or highway?

Driver: Overtaking is easier on a ring road or highway because there are fewer traffic participants. If the car in front is driving slowly, I would just overtake after judging their intentions.

Interviewer: So, you need to...
Speaker 1: If there are no other vehicles on the ring road or highway and he is driving slowly, what would you do?

Speaker 2: I would assess the situation and then overtake him directly.

Speaker 1: So besides judging the intention of the vehicle in front, do you need to consider other factors, like the space for overtaking?

Speaker 2: Yes, definitely. I would assess the situation thoroughly.

Speaker 1: And what about the left lane? How do you judge the situation there?

Speaker 2: If there is a car approaching quickly in the left lane while I'm overtaking, I would abandon the maneuver. But if the car is far away and the relative speed is increasing, I would proceed with overtaking.

Speaker 1: So, if either of these conditions is met, you would proceed. Do you also observe other areas, like behind you or the right side?

Speaker 2: I don't deliberately focus on those areas.

Speaker 1: You don't deliberately focus on them, just the ring road.

Speaker 2: On the highway, it's straightforward. When approaching the exit, I would turn right in the last 20 meters.

Speaker 1: So, it's similar to what you mentioned earlier about slightly moving to the left to observe the situation.

Speaker 2: Yes, by moving to the left, I can also check the rearview mirror to see the situation behind me. Then, I would turn right in the last 20 meters.

Speaker 1: I understand. At that moment, you are actually looking at the position of the rearview mirror.

Speaker 2: Yes, that's correct.

Speaker 1: You can see the left wheel, even if it crosses the line, to check the situation.

Speaker 2: Yes, especially since it's a dashed line.

Speaker 1: At this point, you know what the other driver intends to do, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.

Speaker 1: Just now, you glanced at the non-motorized lane because something suddenly appeared in your left field of vision, previously blocked by a blind spot.

Speaker 2: Yes, that's right. I also check the exit on the left side to see if any other cars are coming out.

Speaker 1: The exit of the residential area on the left side, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, to see if any cars are coming out.

Speaker 1: So, you habitually scan the area, especially before making a turn.

Speaker 2: Yes, because I'm driving slowly, I make sure to scan the area.

Speaker 1: At this point, you are also looking at the pedestrians on the left sidewalk.

Speaker 2: Yes, it's a bit boring, but necessary.

Speaker 1: I understand. It's similar to when you make a U-turn and check the right side.

Speaker 2: Yes, exactly, checking the pedestrians on the sidewalk.

Speaker 1: And before turning right, you ensure there are no non-motorized vehicles that could affect you. After turning, you glance at the left rearview mirror again.
Before making the turn, I had already assessed that there were no other people or vehicles in the bike lane that could affect me or be affected by me. 

Interviewer: I noticed that after you completed the turn, you glanced at the left mirror. What was the reason for that?

Driver: There might have been a car approaching.

Interviewer: Was there a car or a pedestrian suddenly coming from the opposite direction?

Driver: Yes, there was a car coming from the main road on my left side at a high speed.

Interviewer: After 400 meters, you will reach the destination. Now, I have a few questions beyond your driving habits. The first question is, for this experiment, did you pay special attention to anything to ensure driving safety?

Driver: No, I didn't pay extra attention. I usually pay the same amount of attention, but I might drive more aggressively.

Interviewer: So, today's driving was more aggressive than usual?

Driver: No, actually, I usually drive more aggressively. But my level of observation and alertness is the same as today.

Interviewer: So, your usual aggressive driving doesn't make you observe more?

Driver: No, it might even be less.

Interviewer: From today's driving, do you think it was similar to your usual driving?

Driver: Yes, it was quite similar.

Interviewer: Did you intentionally change your driving behavior today to be more conservative?

Driver: Yes, I was more conservative with the accelerator, using it less aggressively and more smoothly.

Interviewer: So, can I understand that your expectations were lower today?

Driver: Yes, I aimed for a lower acceleration.

Interviewer: Did you also start braking earlier?

Driver: Yes, I started braking earlier to ensure a smoother stop.

Interviewer: Is there a difference in your driving style with or without passengers?

Driver: Yes, with passengers, I start braking much earlier.

Interviewer: So, today's driving style was similar to when you have passengers?

Driver: Yes, it was quite similar.

Interviewer: Did you pay extra attention to the steering wheel?

Driver: No, it was about the same as usual.

Interviewer: Do you think there's anything else you could do to improve safety?

Driver: When approaching blind spots, I might pay more attention, but sometimes it's not useful because if a collision is imminent, it's already too late to react.
Speaker 1:
There are some situations where paying attention might not help. If my car is already in a certain position, if you're going to crash, it would have already happened. I can't suddenly speed up or slow down.

Speaker 2:
Yes, but you still think that paying more attention might help.

Speaker 1:
Like the first time I entered the main road, a car suddenly cut in. So, the second time, you think I should have checked the right mirror again when turning right.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I think I usually do that. Maybe not always, but often.

Speaker 1:
Can you recall what you usually do in such situations? At that moment, you noticed the car but didn't brake. How did you handle it?

Speaker 2:
I was coasting at that time. When I noticed the car, I was definitely coasting. I didn't brake immediately.

Speaker 1:
How did you adjust? Did you use the steering wheel?

Speaker 2:
I turned slightly to the left.

Speaker 1:
When did you notice the car?

Speaker 2:
When it started to come out.

Speaker 1:
So, you noticed it then.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I noticed it and adjusted the steering wheel accordingly. Once it stopped, I corrected my course and continued scanning the surroundings.

Speaker 1:
Going back to my earlier question, can you recall any situations or conditions that you find particularly frightening while driving?

Speaker 2:
I'm particularly afraid of sudden obstacles because they are unavoidable. If such a situation occurs, apart from braking, there's nothing else I can do. That's why I'm especially scared of them.

Speaker 1:
So, to prevent such situations, what do you usually do?

Speaker 2:
If the situation on the right side is uncertain, I usually stop. For example, if a car is coasting, I keep my foot near the brake when approaching an intersection.

Speaker 1:
But you don't deliberately slow down in advance, just release the accelerator?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I release the accelerator but don't brake unless necessary. If a sudden obstacle appears, I brake. My expected speed in such situations is much lower than usual, especially if I anticipate a potential obstacle within 50 meters.

Speaker 2:
Yes.
**Interviewer:** At that time, did you expect your speed to be significantly lower than usual? For instance, if you thought there might be a sudden pedestrian appearing within 50 meters ahead.

**Interviewee:** Yes, exactly. For example, near schools, I anticipate that there might be many parents and children around. So, I would lower my speed accordingly.

**Interviewer:** At that moment, you were looking at the elderly lady, right? What was your judgment then?

**Interviewee:** Yes, I noticed that she was aware of me.

**Interviewer:** Because you saw her look back at you, right? What did you do next?

**Interviewee:** I then checked the right side to ensure there were no other hazards.

**Interviewer:** So, you felt that since she noticed you, it was safe, and you wouldn't need to change your path. Why did you look back again?

**Interviewee:** I was checking to see if there were any other vehicles or pedestrians on the right side. It wasn't about the rearview mirror.

**Interviewer:** I was looking at the rearview mirror.

**Interviewee:** I might have glanced towards the car window. It’s possible I was looking out the window.

**Interviewer:** So, you were sure you weren't looking at the rearview mirror?

**Interviewee:** Yes, I was looking out the window, using my peripheral vision to check the right side.

**Interviewer:** In 100 meters, you will reach your destination. In situations where there are many pedestrians walking on the road, what do you usually do?

**Interviewee:** I keep observing to see if they notice me.

**Interviewer:** Did you notice that your attention wasn't on the pedestrians on the left side?

**Interviewee:** They were walking, and I saw someone on the left look up.

**Interviewer:** So, you think they saw you and were moving to the right?

**Interviewee:** Yes, they saw me and were moving to the right, giving me more space.

**Interviewer:** So, you anticipated that they would move to the right, allowing you to pass safely.

**Interviewee:** Yes, I expected that they would move to the right, and even if they didn't, by the time I passed, they would have moved enough for me to go through safely.

**Interviewer:** Besides sudden pedestrians, are there other situations that you find particularly concerning?

**Interviewee:** Yes, being hit by another car, especially when entering a main road.

**Interviewer:** Like when a car suddenly appears from a blind spot?

**Interviewee:** Exactly, and the other car doesn't show any intention of slowing down. Normally, a driver would slow down and check when approaching an intersection, but this car didn't slow down at all. It just passed by me, which was very frightening because I couldn't do anything to avoid it.
Speaker 1:
So, you didn't slow down at all, and the car just passed by you. In that situation, you couldn't do anything because it happened so suddenly. Are there any other situations that you find particularly scary?

Speaker 2:
Yes, similar situations with delivery vehicles. These delivery drivers often don't have rearview mirrors.

Speaker 1:
So, you were aware that they don't have rearview mirrors. In such cases, do you take extra precautions because of that?

Speaker 2:
Yes, if I need to overtake them, I do it quickly. If I don't plan to overtake, I slow down and follow them at a safe distance. I observe their behavior, especially when I'm about 10 meters behind them, to see what they are doing.

Speaker 1:
So, you observe them to see if they are distracted or driving normally.

Speaker 2:
Yes, sometimes they might be using their phone or checking a map.

Speaker 1:
But you can only observe their behavior after you've completely overtaken them, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, it's more out of curiosity.

Speaker 1:
So, it's just curiosity.

Speaker 2:
Yes, especially if their speed or position seems unusual.

Speaker 1:
So, you sometimes guess what they might be doing, like using their phone or something else.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I might guess they are using their phone, drinking, or doing something else. It's not about gender, but sometimes female drivers might drive more slowly or hesitantly. 

Speaker 1:
I can't quite remember, but did you describe your left-turn driving habits?

Speaker 2:
No, I haven't described that yet.

Speaker 1:
Okay, let's use this scenario to describe your left-turn driving habits.

Speaker 2:
When I make a left turn, I always check my rearview mirror first. As I approach the turn, I look at the left rearview mirror to ensure there are no cars overtaking me.

Speaker 1:
So, you check the left rearview mirror to observe and confirm.

Speaker 2:
Yes, to make sure there are no cars coming up from behind.

Speaker 1:
Shouldn't the left turn be made from the leftmost lane?

Speaker 2:
In some cases, yes, but it depends on the road markings.

Speaker 1:
I understand. So, after checking the left rearview mirror...

Speaker 2:
I proceed with the turn.
**Speaker 1:**
At this entrance, it's not always possible to predict what might happen.

**Speaker 2:**
I understand what you mean. It's all dashed lines, so after checking the left rearview mirror...

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, after checking the left rearview mirror, you look into the intersection.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I look into the intersection because I've already reached the road.

**Speaker 1:**
When you look into the intersection, do you mean looking to the left or straight ahead?

**Speaker 2:**
I mean the entrance of the intersection.

**Speaker 1:**
Right, the entrance. Exactly.

**Speaker 2:**
From the entrance.

**Speaker 1:**
And when you look into the intersection, what are you observing?

**Speaker 2:**
I'm checking if there are any cars in the intersection that might rush out.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you're looking to your right to see if any cars are coming from that direction. Then what do you do?

**Speaker 2:**
After that, I observe the road.

**Speaker 1:**
You observe the position of the car coming from the right. Can I ask why you follow this observation sequence?

**Speaker 2:**
First, I look to the left to ensure that when I want to turn left, there are no cars behind me. For example, my speed might have already decreased, and there could be fast-moving vehicles, even electric bikes, trying to overtake. It's crucial to confirm this. Secondly, I look into the entrance because cars rushing out from there pose a significant danger. Lastly, I look to the right because, subconsciously, I don't expect cars from the right to be moving very fast. The right side is more densely built-up, and there might be parked cars nearby, so I anticipate less danger from that side. Cars from the right are likely to be slower, and if there's an issue, it's their responsibility.

**Speaker 1:**
Why do you think that?

**Speaker 2:**
Because the cars on the main road have the right of way. If a car rushes out and collides with a car on the main road...

**Speaker 1:**
But they are also moving.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but in this situation, they are entering the main road, so the responsibility lies with them. Observing the right side is more of a verification step rather than a preventive measure. If they see me and still rush out, I would have to brake suddenly. But their actions won't influence my initial decisions.

**Speaker 1:**
I understand. So, you feel that when you turn left, you are ahead, and if they collide with you, it would be on your right rear side, similar to a rear-end collision. What about your steering, acceleration, and braking when turning left?

**Speaker 2:**
I would first decelerate and coast, then... apply a bit of acceleration.
Speaker 1: So, when making a left turn, how do you handle the steering, accelerator, and brake?

Speaker 2: First, I coast and then apply a bit of brake. After I start turning the wheel, I gradually release the brake and smoothly engage the accelerator.

Speaker 1: Left turns can be different from right turns. When do you start turning the wheel for a left turn?

Speaker 2: It's similar to a right turn. I start turning after crossing the stop line.

Speaker 1: So, it's the same as a right turn, but with speed, you might start turning a bit earlier, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, because of the speed, I might start turning just before reaching the intersection.

Speaker 1: And you had to make a tighter turn because of the car on the right?

Speaker 2: Yes, there was a car on the right, so I couldn't make a wide turn.

Speaker 1: Are there any other dangerous scenarios you want to mention? For example, dealing with non-motorized vehicles like delivery bikes without rearview mirrors?

Speaker 2: Yes, and also when encountering oncoming traffic in the wrong lane.

Speaker 1: When the other vehicle is in the wrong lane, how do you react?

Speaker 2: I try to avoid it by moving laterally and slowing down if necessary.

Speaker 1: Do you have any bad driving habits that could be dangerous?

Speaker 2: Sometimes I follow other cars too closely, maintaining only a 10-meter distance, which is too close.

Speaker 1: Anything else?

Speaker 2: On open roads, I tend to relax too much, which can lead to distractions like checking my phone or navigation.

Speaker 1: Do you still scan the road in such situations?

Speaker 2: Yes, but less frequently because on wide, open roads, it feels less necessary.

Speaker 1: Any other bad driving habits?

Speaker 2: Not really, but I try to avoid them.

Speaker 1: When you're a passenger, what driving behaviors make you feel unsafe?

Speaker 2: On narrow roads, like in villages or small communities, if the driver goes too fast, it makes me uneasy.

Speaker 1: Even if you know they won't hit anything?

Speaker 2: Yes, but there's still a high chance of unexpected obstacles in such areas.
Speaker 1: You can drive very fast, but...

Speaker 2: I won't hit anything. Although you know you won't hit anything.

Speaker 1: Yes, but there's a high chance of encountering a residential area.

Speaker 2: So, you would feel very unsafe. Besides this, are there other situations that make you feel unsafe?

Speaker 1: For example, braking hard and skidding. Of course, this is rare. As a passenger...

Speaker 2: Braking hard means the wheels lock up and the ABS kicks in. I get particularly worried about the front wheels losing grip.

Speaker 1: And then you lose control.

Speaker 2: Yes, when the front wheels lose grip, they slide on the road, and you can't steer properly. However, I am quite tolerant of aggressive driving because I drive aggressively myself. But I am most concerned about driving on narrow roads or in unknown conditions.

Speaker 1: Let's look at this intersection. It's an intersection without traffic lights. First, you make a right turn, and on the way back, you make a left turn. When making a right turn, you should first check for oncoming traffic from the left.

Speaker 2: Yes, but this time I didn't check the right rear because I had been checking it continuously before.

Speaker 1: You were continuously checking the right rear.

Speaker 2: Yes, and I expected my speed to be faster than most cars at this intersection. If my speed is faster, why should I worry about being overtaken from behind?

Speaker 1: But there's a possibility that someone might cross the intersection, and you need to be aware of pedestrians or other vehicles.

Speaker 2: Yes, but I had already checked, and there was no one.

Speaker 1: For example, if there was a person here...

Speaker 2: If there was a person, I would first check the left mirror, then turn my head to the right. Even if someone crossed, I could stop in time.

Speaker 1: You could stop in time.

Speaker 2: Yes, because my speed in the middle of the road is already very low. If I suddenly brake, I can stop within 200 meters.

Speaker 1: Understood. Turn right at the traffic light in 100 meters. Now, you start scanning the area again as you approach the intersection. Can you describe this situation?

Speaker 2: This situation is...
**Speaker 1:**
At the traffic light intersection, make a right turn. Good, now start scanning the area again. As we approach the waypoint, can you describe the situation?

**Speaker 2:**
Sure, it's a bit awkward.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, because you know you need to change lanes, but the car in front of you is occupying the space you need. So, you’re wondering whether to change lanes now or wait until later, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly, I was hesitating.

**Speaker 1:**
You were hesitating whether to change lanes or not?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I was unsure whether to cross the solid line.

**Speaker 1:**
Whether to cross the solid line or not?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because I didn't really want to brake. I didn't want to slow down.

**Speaker 1:**
You wanted to maintain your speed?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because the light ahead was green, and I could make a right turn without stopping.

**Speaker 1:**
Even if the light was red, you didn't want to brake because you were still far from the stopping point?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
So, after this hesitation, how did you make your final decision?

**Speaker 2:**
I decided to maintain my speed and keep observing the situation.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you decided not to worry about the other car's position for now?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I decided to make the right turn and then pass it.

**Speaker 1:**
Were you worried that the other car might suddenly move left?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I was concerned about that.

**Speaker 1:**
You were worried it might suddenly move left?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I was worried it might suddenly move left. I didn't notice if the car had side mirrors.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you were concerned that the driver might not see you and could turn left, potentially causing a collision?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I was driving cautiously. I didn't want to brake suddenly. I also considered crossing the solid line because there were no cameras at the intersection to catch me.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you felt it was safe to cross the line and make the right turn?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I checked the intersection beforehand and knew there were no cameras.

**Speaker 1:**
You could have also honked to alert the other driver or let them go first since you were close to the turn.

**Speaker 2:**
I don't usually honk. I find it disruptive, especially with passengers in the car. Honking often startles the driver in front, so I avoid it unless absolutely necessary.
Speaker 1:
Moreover, there was a car in front, and I didn't want to disturb it. I think honking the horn would just scare the driver ahead, so I prefer to avoid it. It's a low-reward action.

Speaker 2:
Yes, at that moment, I maintained a steady speed and didn't wait for the car in front. Instead, I changed lanes to the right. I felt it was worth taking a small risk.

Speaker 1:
I see. So, you were driving at a low speed, and even if the car in front moved slowly to the left, a collision would likely be minor, just a scrape. You could maneuver left or right to avoid a serious impact. The worst-case scenario would be a minor side scrape, not a head-on collision, and no one would be seriously hurt. There were no monitoring parameters, and you were about 350 meters from your destination.

Speaker 2:
Exactly. 

Speaker 1:
Now, aside from the value of the action, do you usually consider the experience of your passengers while driving? What aspects of their experience do you pay attention to?

Speaker 2:
I pay attention to whether they seem drowsy or if they are being tossed around due to sudden braking.

Speaker 1:
So, if a passenger appears drowsy, you drive more gently?

Speaker 2:
Yes, if they seem drowsy, I drive more gently. If they are alert and paying attention to the driving dynamics and surroundings, I know they can anticipate my actions like turning or braking. In that case, I can drive more aggressively.

Speaker 1:
I understand. So, when passengers are alert, they can anticipate what will happen next, making it easier for them to accept more dynamic driving. But if they are drowsy or have their eyes closed, they can't anticipate or perceive what's happening outside, making any sudden action feel unexpected. So, you try to minimize the impact of your driving on them.

Speaker 2:
Exactly.

Speaker 1:
That's a general approach. Are there specific actions you take to ensure passenger comfort?

Speaker 2:
I brake more smoothly and gradually.

Speaker 1:
And what about accelerating?

Speaker 2:
I accelerate gradually as well, avoiding sudden increases in speed.

Speaker 1:
So, you give the car time to transition smoothly?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I ensure a smooth transition, especially when exiting a turn. I don't accelerate until the turn is fully completed.

Speaker 1:
Understood.
**Speaker 1:**
Do you tend to accelerate late, like only after completely exiting a turn, rather than during the turn?

**Speaker 2:**
The timing of acceleration remains the same. Yes, it doesn't change.

**Speaker 1:**
But I still accelerate.

**Speaker 2:**
Speed.

**Speaker 1:**
Are there any other factors?

**Speaker 2:**
Or the speed through the turn, the overall speed decreases. The overall speed decreases by reducing the car's speed to lower than expected before entering the turn.

**Speaker 1:**
Actually, it's somewhat similar to the differences between two driving styles. In what specific aspects do these differences manifest? It seems a bit like that, and we can highlight these differences focusing on passenger comfort.

**Speaker 2:**
The difference between aggressive and conservative driving is essentially about compressing two curves. You can think of it as compressing the Y-axis.

**Speaker 1:**
Compressing the Y-axis.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, compressing it, and possibly extending it. But the specific timing points, because the duration.

**Speaker 1:**
The review time will be extended, so the Excel sheet will also be slightly extended.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, and taking cornering behavior as an example, you adjust the braking point, the turning point, the acceleration point, and the exit point. These points in time might not change on the X-axis, but their magnitude will be reduced. Other transitional processes, like braking earlier, can also be extended on the X-axis. The magnitude is reduced, but the transitional process's timing remains the same, whether aggressive or conservative.

**Speaker 1:**
So the overall time to pass through doesn't change.

**Speaker 2:**
Not necessarily, but relative to the entry point.

**Speaker 1:**
So when the X-axis is width.

**Speaker 2:**
The trajectory doesn't change, but the speed curve and overall velocity are reduced.

**Speaker 1:**
It might be consistent throughout the entire turn, this aspect doesn't change.

**Speaker 2:**
That's the difference.

**Speaker 1:**
Let's continue to another scenario.

**Speaker 2:**
Turn right in 10 meters.

**Speaker 1:**
Now we're still in a scanning process. Earlier, I wanted to ask you about a situation where there was a delivery truck. It seemed like it was avoiding a parked car in front, and it moved into your lane for a short distance. Yes, right here. At that moment, I noticed from the video that you didn't brake. You didn't even seem to release the accelerator. It looked like you were coasting.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I was coasting, I had released the accelerator.

**Speaker 1:**
But you didn't move to the brake pedal or adjust the steering wheel.

**Speaker 2:**
Approaching the waypoint.

**Speaker 1:**
Then turn right in 10 meters. What do you think are some of your less ideal driving habits?
Speaker 1: So, what are some of your driving habits that might affect the comfort of your passengers?

Speaker 2: I tend to drive at higher speeds, especially when taking turns. I prefer to maintain my speed through the turn rather than slowing down.

Speaker 1: So, you shorten the time it takes to go through a turn, which can create strong lateral acceleration and make passengers feel like they're being thrown to the side.

Speaker 2: Yes, some people find it uncomfortable.

Speaker 1: Are there any other habits that might affect passenger comfort?

Speaker 2: I sometimes follow other cars too closely, which can be risky if the car in front suddenly brakes.

Speaker 1: Do you have any other habits that might be concerning?

Speaker 2: Not that I can think of right now.

Speaker 1: Okay, where are we headed next?

Speaker 2: Take a right turn up ahead, then slow down. It's a bit complicated.

Speaker 1: Got it. Anything else you want to mention?

Speaker 2: No, that's about it. I think we've covered everything.

Speaker 1: Alright, let's move on to the next topic. When you're a passenger, what behaviors from other drivers make you uncomfortable?

Speaker 2: I have a high tolerance for aggressive driving, but I feel unsafe when drivers speed on narrow roads.

Speaker 1: So, you don't usually feel uncomfortable, but you do feel unsafe in those situations.

Speaker 2: Exactly. I don't feel physically uncomfortable, but I do feel unsafe.

Speaker 1: Understood. We also have some data from the passenger's perspective. We need to analyze the time they interacted with the controls. If they didn't interact within the first 12 minutes and 30 seconds, we can disregard that data.

Speaker 2: Okay, let's check if there was any interaction within that timeframe.

Speaker 1: Alright, if there was no interaction before 4:45, we can skip it.

Speaker 2: Sure, let's take a look.

Speaker 1: Let's see if there was any interaction within the first three minutes.

Speaker 2: Alright, let's check.
Speaker 1:
Alright, before 45, you...

Speaker 2:
Look, it was three minutes before 45.

Speaker 1:
No? Take a look first.

Speaker 2:
What do you mean by three minutes? It should have been three minutes.

Speaker 1:
Three minutes have passed.

Speaker 2:
No, it hasn't.

Speaker 1:
Yes, it has. When you start driving, let me know. It should be around 15 minutes, which is enough for 5 minutes.

Speaker 2:
Okay, the first two. Alright, I'll continue asking you questions, and you don't need to worry about the data rate; I'll handle that.

Speaker 1:
How many minutes before?

Speaker 2:
No problem, we can check it later and you can send the time. We can also show you where they press the handle. Are you interested?

Speaker 1:
Can you explain the situation? Your hand is uncomfortable.

Speaker 2:
Yes, if they feel uncomfortable or unsafe, they will press a handle. You can see it, but we might not be able to pinpoint the exact second in the video. It might be difficult. However, we can determine the general range in which the handle was pressed. Today, while driving, you mentioned considering the passenger's comfort. Are there any other aspects you particularly focus on?

Speaker 1:
No, just the usual.

Speaker 2:
So, nothing special compared to usual driving. Do you think there's any way to make passengers feel more comfortable? Previously, we asked about safety, now we're asking about comfort.

Speaker 1:
I don't think my driving behavior can make passengers feel more grateful.

Speaker 2:
So, there's no room for improvement?

Speaker 1:
Yes, because I've already become very smooth.

Speaker 2:
Alright, the next questions might be a bit challenging, so take your time to think before answering. The first question is, what do you think makes a good or professional driver? What should they at least be able to do?

Speaker 1:
A good driver should be able to anticipate situations. They should be able to stop at the right time and accurately assess the situation using all available information to predict the worst possible outcome.

Speaker 2:
So, I understand there are two requirements: one is to gather as much information as possible from the road, and the second is to make accurate predictions based on that information. Both are essential. Are the requirements for a good driver and a professional driver basically the same?

Speaker 1:
Yes, that's right.

Speaker 2:
Alright, next question. What do you think is the biggest difference between an experienced driver and a novice driver?
**Interviewer:** Are the requirements for a regular driver and a professional driver basically the same?

**Interviewee:** Yes, that's right.

**Interviewer:** Okay. So, the next question: What do you think is the biggest difference between an experienced driver and a novice driver?

**Interviewee:** A novice driver, or rather, the difference between a novice driver and an experienced driver.

**Interviewer:** Yes, what is the biggest gap between the two?

**Interviewee:** For novice drivers, as I mentioned earlier, they might not be able to utilize all the available information. For example, they might only focus on the left side, the right side, or the middle, without integrating all the information effectively.

**Interviewer:** So, you believe that experienced drivers will fully utilize all available information?

**Interviewee:** Yes, experienced drivers can focus on specific areas or directions and use the information effectively. However, novice drivers might not be as aware of the need to pay attention to all aspects.

**Interviewer:** In your understanding, what is the key difference between an experienced driver and a good driver?

**Interviewee:** Experienced drivers might be more confident. For instance, they might assume there are no cars on the right side without double-checking, based on their previous experiences. This can sometimes lead to overconfidence.

**Interviewer:** So, a good driver needs to build on the foundation of an experienced driver but also maintain some of the caution of a novice driver?

**Interviewee:** Exactly. A good driver should retain the caution of a novice driver while having the confidence of an experienced driver.

**Interviewer:** So, in your view, being an experienced driver doesn't necessarily mean always heading in a positive direction?

**Interviewee:** Yes, experienced drivers can become overconfident and might not handle unexpected situations as well. They are good at dealing with common scenarios but might struggle with sudden, unusual events.

**Interviewer:** So, in unexpected situations, an experienced driver might not perform as well as a cautious novice driver?

**Interviewee:** Yes, because a cautious novice driver might be more careful and take fewer risks, leading to less severe consequences.

**Interviewer:** Are there any other differences?

**Interviewee:** Not really. The main difference is how they handle information and their level of caution. Whether they drive fast or slow is more about their intention rather than their effort.

**Interviewer:** Understood. Next question.

**Interviewee:** Sure.

**Interviewer:** In what aspects do you think autonomous vehicles can't match human drivers?

**Interviewee:** For example, in making nuanced decisions.

**Interviewer:** You mean the kind of decisions that require human intuition?

**Interviewee:** Yes, the subtle adjustments. However, if an autonomous vehicle's AI can be trained with enough data, it might be able to make similar decisions. But since every person is different, it's hard to say if an AI can fully replicate human decision-making.
**Speaker 1:**
How do you think the agent manages to do that? I believe it can be done, but it might not exist yet. I think it can adapt. This decision-making process varies because everyone is different. For instance, with the lane marking situation we discussed earlier, I believe I can be flexible.

**Speaker 2:**
But when you mention lane marking, you mean turning right while still being in the straight lane, correct?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, in such a situation, I can consider various options within my thought process. However, an autonomous vehicle might not take the same approach due to different considerations. It would definitely slow down and move to the right lane, waiting for the non-restricted vehicle ahead or for the entrance to clear before proceeding. This is something an autonomous vehicle can't adapt to as well.

**Speaker 2:**
Do you think it can't do it because it can't make such decisions, or because it filters out such options? I believe it's the latter. Do you agree?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, it filters them out. The consequence of this is that passengers might feel a sudden change, and the time to cross the intersection increases. In reality, you could adapt, for example, if it's a dashed line, you could move from the straight lane to the right lane and then turn right. An experienced driver might think you're being overly cautious. I understand that autonomous driving might have the same thought process as me, but it can't take the same risks.

**Speaker 2:**
So, it uses a stricter filter than traffic regulations, eliminating all the possible choices.

**Speaker 1:**
Exactly. And I noticed that the entrance didn't have lane markings or monitoring, so technically, I could have continued straight.

**Speaker 2:**
But it wouldn't do that. Right.

**Speaker 1:**
And if you're on a suburban road with little traffic and no cameras at the intersection, like on a country road or in open fields, there are straight lanes and right-turn lanes. If the right-turn lane is blocked due to an accident or a queue, or if a car suddenly stops there, the autonomous vehicle would just wait. It wouldn't use the straight lane to bypass the blockage because that would be illegal, even though humans understand the need to adapt.

**Speaker 2:**
Let me add a question. Do you think this limitation in adaptability is due to the rules, or is it because the model's input data is insufficient, or something else?

**Speaker 1:**
I think it's due to the rules. When deploying to mass-produced cars, it undergoes rigorous testing, and such behavior is not accepted in those tests. So, I believe it's the rules.
Speaker 1:
Besides that aspect, do you think there are any other factors?

Speaker 2:
When it comes to vehicle adjustments, I believe it can achieve safety. So, I think the differences in other aspects are not significant. The main issue is flexibility.

Speaker 1:
The next question is, how do you judge the intentions of other pedestrians, non-motorized vehicles, and motor vehicles while driving?

Speaker 2:
Primarily, it's like a constrained model. You can understand it as an inertial body, right? Its second derivative won't change suddenly. No, its first derivative won't change suddenly. For example, if its action is x, its speed won't jump. So, I can use a short-term stable constrained model. If it's moving in one direction, I predict it will continue in that direction for a short period, and I just need to ensure I don't collide with it during that time.

Speaker 1:
But I think pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles might be more unpredictable.

Speaker 2:
Yes, they can be unpredictable. But I consider that sudden changes come with a cost. For example, if a pedestrian is walking normally and suddenly stops or turns around to run into the street, it requires a significant incentive and cost. So, I understand that they are less likely to take such actions.

Speaker 2:
Does the prediction vary with the type of object? Yes, it does. For example, a balloon floating in the wind can be dangerous because it can suddenly drift to the left. In such cases, I would keep a distance. But if it's a pedestrian or someone who looks heavier, I would predict their behavior to be more stable.

Speaker 1:
So, during driving, you categorize traffic participants to determine which ones are dangerous and which ones are not?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. This includes pedestrians, non-motorized vehicles, and even other motor vehicles. I categorize them and use different models to predict their behavior.

Speaker 1:
If you categorize something as relatively safe, you consider it as having a stable constrained model, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, but if it's unsafe, like a car or something with a potential hazard, I choose to avoid it. For example, if it's in front of me, I would stop and keep a safe distance.

Speaker 1:
So, you consider categorization and avoidance while driving, and at the same time...
**Speaker 1:**
For example, if a vehicle is in front of me, it will choose to stop first and then proceed when it's safe.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, considering the classification and avoidance, you also need to weigh the benefits and risks simultaneously.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you classify first, then observe the trajectory changes, the space, and the potential hotspots. Based on how critical the situation is, you make a decision.

**Speaker 2:**
If it's too close, you might not dare to take the risk of blocking it. If it's farther away, the risk is slightly smaller.

**Speaker 1:**
In that case, you would choose to pass through as quickly as possible.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
When observing, what specific aspects do you need to consider for pedestrians, non-motorized vehicles, and motorized vehicles?

**Speaker 2:**
You need to observe their behavior and whether they are aware of your presence.

**Speaker 1:**
Let's break it down into pedestrians, non-motorized vehicles, and motorized vehicles. For pedestrians, what do you observe?

**Speaker 2:**
You need to see if they are moving or stationary and whether they have noticed you.

**Speaker 1:**
This is very important. Have they noticed you?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, and also their facial direction. Have they seen you?

**Speaker 1:**
Not necessarily. For example, if someone is walking on the road and slowly moving to the right, even if they don't look at you directly, you can infer from their trajectory that they are aware of you.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, or even if they haven't noticed me, they are still moving away, which means they are avoiding risk. So, you classify them as safe.

**Speaker 1:**
What about non-motorized vehicles? What do you observe?

**Speaker 2:**
For bicycles, I observe if they are wobbling left and right, if the rider is focused, if the tires are intact, if they are looking at navigation, or if they are on the phone. For electric bikes, I observe if their trajectory has significant lateral movement. Electric bikes are simpler; I just focus on whether they have large lateral movements.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you find electric bikes simpler than bicycles?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because electric bikes have greater inertia. If the rider needs to make a sudden evasive maneuver, it requires more control, like shifting the center of gravity.

**Speaker 1:**
But theoretically, their acceleration is greater than that of bicycles.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly.
Speaker 1:
For instance, if someone needs to change lanes, should they adjust their center of gravity?

Speaker 2:
Yes, but theoretically, their acceleration capability is much greater than that of a bicycle.

Speaker 1:
So, the potential danger they can cause is also higher than that of a bicycle. How do you assess this?

Speaker 2:
It depends on the type of delivery person.

Speaker 1:
You categorize them more specifically, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. I judge based on their profession and whether they are in a hurry or not. Essentially, I believe that electric bikes, and even motorcycles, are safer because they can adjust and change their state. Although they have the capability, they can still change their state. The rider needs to ensure they don't cause harm to others. With bicycles, even a slight shift in the center of gravity can cause significant movement.

Speaker 1:
Yes, they can move quite a bit.

Speaker 2:
Right, so whether it's intentional or not, their path can vary greatly. That's why I consider bicycles to be more dangerous. So, I categorize them accordingly.

Speaker 1:
So, you mainly observe their movement trajectory?

Speaker 2:
Yes, the trajectory along with the rider.

Speaker 1:
For electric bikes, you also consider the rider. And for motor vehicles, you mentioned you look at the brake lights to see what the driver is doing. Besides the brake lights, what else do you consider?

Speaker 2:
Other factors are more significant.

Speaker 1:
Other factors are more significant, like?

Speaker 2:
For example, if the vehicle is drifting within the lane.

Speaker 1:
If it's drifting to the left or right, you might judge that it's about to change lanes or turn.

Speaker 2:
Or it could be unintentional.

Speaker 1:
Got it. Do you have any additional comments on this topic?

Speaker 2:
No, I think you can generally assess the situation based on the vehicle's movement and the driver's attention. You can determine if the driver is highly aware or not, and whether they are in a hurry or not. This can help in making a more accurate assessment.

Speaker 1:
We have one last question. Imagine a scenario where you are approaching an intersection without traffic lights, and there are pedestrians also trying to cross. Since there are no traffic signals, there's no clear rule on who should go first. Both of you see each other and might decide to stop to let the other pass to avoid risk. But if both of you stop at the same time, no one moves, and both lose time. Then, you both might decide to go at the same time, causing another conflict, and then stop again.

Speaker 2:
Yes.
**Speaker 1:**
When you see the other person stop, you might choose to move forward, but then you both end up conflicting again and have to stop.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it gets tighter and tighter.

**Speaker 1:**
In such a situation, how would you handle it? How would you judge the pedestrian's intention?

**Speaker 2:**
In this case, I would probably let them go first.

**Speaker 1:**
Is that so?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes. For example, if the car window is transparent, I might make a hand gesture.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you describe what kind of hand gesture you usually use?

**Speaker 2:**
I would wave my hand, like a signal to go ahead.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you habitually use your left hand for this?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I use my left hand to signal.

**Speaker 1:**
Besides hand gestures, is there anything else you do?

**Speaker 2:**
If my car window is open, I might extend my hand outside.

**Speaker 1:**
Apart from hand gestures, is there anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
Generally, no. If I choose to yield, I usually just use hand gestures.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you come to a complete stop or do you maintain a slow, steady speed?

**Speaker 2:**
I come to a complete stop.

**Speaker 1:**
I don't have any more questions.

**Speaker 2:**
No, that's all.

**Speaker 1:**
Our interview is now over.

**Speaker 2:**
Alright.

**Speaker 1:**
There is a form here that you need to fill out.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you have anything else you'd like to discuss?

**Speaker 2:**
No, unless it's about the driver's perception in our experiment. Goodbye.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about participating in our experiment today?

**Speaker 2:**
I think the attention to detail was impressive. Everything was done very meticulously, especially in handling unexpected situations during the experiment. Overall, it was very rigorous.
