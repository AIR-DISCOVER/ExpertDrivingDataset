**Transcript:**

**Interviewer:**
We are about to start the interview. I will be recording this session, and then we will play the video of your recent driving. The red dots on the screen represent where you were looking while driving. I will ask you some questions based on the video.

**Interviewer:**
The microphone should be working fine. Before we get into the actual driving part, I have some warm-up questions. What types of vehicles have you driven? Gasoline cars, electric cars, SUVs, or any other types?

**Driver:**
All of them.

**Interviewer:**
Can you list some of them?

**Driver:**
Sure, gasoline cars like Passat, Magotan, and other small cars like Audi, BMW, and Mercedes.

**Interviewer:**
What about the types?

**Driver:**
Yes, small cars like A-class, B-class, and business cars. I've also driven business vehicles like the GL8.

**Interviewer:**
Have you driven larger vehicles?

**Driver:**
Yes, I have.

**Interviewer:**
What types?

**Driver:**
I've driven 37-seater, 19-seater, 11-seater, 17-seater, 53-seater, and 50-seater vehicles.

**Interviewer:**
That's impressive. Have you driven any cars with autonomous or assisted driving features?

**Driver:**
Yes, the highest level I've driven includes lane-keeping assist, brake assist, and other features. For example, the Mercedes S-Class, BMW 7 Series, and Audi A6.

**Interviewer:**
Got it. Do you usually drive short distances in the city or long distances?

**Driver:**
I used to drive long distances more often, but in recent years, it's mostly short distances.

**Interviewer:**
What are the usual purposes of your drives?

**Driver:**
Mostly for company use and administrative purposes.

**Interviewer:**
Do you drive within the Fourth Ring Road, Fifth Ring Road, or elsewhere?

**Driver:**
Within the Sixth Ring Road, but I also go outside it.

**Interviewer:**
How did you feel about driving our vehicle this time?

**Driver:**
It was okay. The space was a bit small, but overall, the driving experience was fine.

**Interviewer:**
Did you notice any issues with the car compared to the ones you usually drive?

**Driver:**
I had a shorter time to get used to it, but the acceleration, handling, and braking were all satisfactory.

**Interviewer:**
Understood. Have you ever been involved in a traffic accident? Can you recall any significant incidents?
Interviewer: How's the acceleration, handling, and braking of the vehicle?

Driver: The acceleration, handling, and braking are all quite good.

Interviewer: Understood. Have you ever been involved in a traffic accident? Can you recall any significant or memorable incidents?

Driver: Oh, most of the time, it's other people hitting me.

Interviewer: Haha, could you describe one of those incidents?

Driver: When I was driving a large vehicle, it was mostly others rear-ending me or scraping the sides. There weren't any major accidents. I'm just talking about the big accidents I've seen.

Interviewer: Can you describe the circumstances under which these accidents occurred?

Driver: Sure, there have been accidents involving fatalities. 

Interviewer: Approximately when did these happen? A year ago, two years, five years, or ten years?

Driver: I've seen them in recent years. There are a lot of chain-reaction collisions, especially during holidays. Bad weather conditions like rain, strong winds, and snow also lead to more accidents. Fatalities are more common in the early morning, especially with trucks.

Interviewer: Got it. Moving on, how long have you been a professional driver?

Driver: 25 years.

Interviewer: Since when?

Driver: Since I was 18.

Interviewer: Understood. What is your current occupation?

Driver: I'm an administrative driver.

Interviewer: Can you describe your daily work routine?

Driver: I handle various tasks, such as driving office vehicles, transporting leaders, and handling different types of receptions.

Interviewer: Can you describe an experience where you felt most proud or accomplished while receiving a leader?

Driver: That would be during the National People's Congress sessions. I drove large vehicles and participated for five consecutive years, receiving leaders from various regions. The details are hard to describe.

Interviewer: Understood. Have you always been an administrative driver?

Driver: Initially, after getting my license, I bought my own vehicle. Back then, I drove a van, mainly transporting computers around Zhongguancun. Later, I upgraded my vehicle and started working for myself. Eventually, I joined a company, got a license for larger vehicles, and started working in tourism and national conferences. During the pandemic, business slowed down, and I even worked as a ride-hailing driver, transitioning from large to small vehicles.
Speaker 1:
So, you did all that, and then later, because of the pandemic, business wasn't good at night. Hmm, and then in between, you also drove for a ride-hailing service? Hmm, for Shouyue. At that time, I switched from a big car to a small car because I had a child at home and couldn't be away for long periods due to the busy nature of tourism. Hmm, later on, I started with Shouyue, and after that, I switched to a small car. I drove the small car for a few years, and then, because business wasn't good during the pandemic, I ended up working for a company.

Speaker 2:
So, you've been driving all this time, and now you're introducing yourself.

Speaker 1:
You seem to have a lot of energy. Alright, next, we'll look at the perspective you started with and ask you some related questions. We're now starting to leave the parking lot. The red area indicates where your eyes are looking. Hmm. And David, Dale, if you encounter anything during the playback that you think drivers should pay special attention to, feel free to ask me to stop. Sure, and if I have any questions for you, I'll also pause the video. Hmm, okay.

Speaker 1:
Now, we should be in the stage of leaving the parking lot.

Speaker 1:
I'm currently at the stage of making a right turn out of the parking lot. Could you describe your turning habits or the situation when you were turning, including any blind spots?

Speaker 2:
When you're leaving the parking lot, like the position you were just in, there are bushes on both sides, creating a semi-blind spot. Hmm, so you definitely need to slow down and take a good look. It's best to stop the car or move very slowly. Hmm, check the blind spots because the bushes are at a height that can obscure your view. For example, you might not see a child or something else clearly, especially in snowy or foggy conditions. So, you need to be a bit slower. After you make the right turn, there's a van on the right, which also creates a blind spot. The van blocks your view on both sides, making it hard to see.

Speaker 1:
In such situations, do you usually stop the car?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I almost come to a stop. You need to make sure you can see clearly before moving. It's like stopping.

Speaker 1:
I see that in Beijing, there are many places with similar blind spots due to bushes.

Speaker 2:
Yes, there are many such blind spots. You just need to be careful because you can't see clearly.

Speaker 1:
Just now, a car passed by. I noticed that you didn't keep your eyes fixed on it.

Speaker 2:
No, you don't need to. The distance and speed are enough that you don't need to keep staring at it to see where it's going.
Speaker 2:
No, you don't need to keep staring at him. Your distance and speed are sufficient. At that moment, you don't need to fixate on his movements because he will see your car approaching. Since he is already going against traffic and there is a car in front of him, you just need to reduce your speed.

Speaker 1:
Oh, I see. So your response is to slow down, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, the first thing you should do in any driving situation is to reduce your speed. Whenever something happens, your immediate reaction should be to ease off the accelerator or, in an emergency, place your foot on the brake, ready to press it if needed.

Speaker 1:
In the situation we just discussed, can you recall when you first started to ease off the accelerator?

Speaker 2:
Even before the bicycle appeared, I saw a white car parked with its trunk open. At that moment, I had already started to ease off the accelerator. There was no need to accelerate further. You just ease off and wait until it's safe to proceed, or you can maneuver around the obstacle if it's close to a turn.

Speaker 1:
So at that point, you weren't accelerating, but you also weren't braking. You were just easing off the accelerator?

Speaker 2:
Exactly. My foot was already off the accelerator. There was no need to accelerate further.

Speaker 1:
How far was the distance, about 50 meters, 30 meters?

Speaker 2:
It was probably around 70 to 80 meters. Experienced drivers tend to notice potential issues early and take action in advance. Less experienced drivers often react only when they are very close to the problem, which can be dangerous.

Speaker 1:
So they end up braking hard.

Speaker 2:
Yes, and that can lead to dangerous situations. You need to give the bicycle enough space to avoid you, and you should also be able to avoid it. That's how it works.

Speaker 1:
Were you worried that someone might come out from in front of the white car?

Speaker 2:
I was observing carefully. Even though you might not be looking directly at the red dot, you are still scanning the area. We don't just stare at one point; we scan the surroundings through the car's windows.
Speaker 1:
Actually, we have already looked at it, because just looking at it won't help us understand.

Speaker 2:
You don't stare directly at it, just glance. You can see through the car's windows in many ways to know if there's something beside it.

Speaker 1:
To put it simply, I changed the way I look at it. I made it more, yes.

Speaker 2:
When I look at this position, I can see through the car's windows or the gap in front of the car's wheels to see if anyone is coming out.

Speaker 1:
Just look at the left front wheel.

Speaker 2:
Yes, when you look at the left front wheel, you can see two people walking parallel to the car. They can't just come over.

Speaker 1:
So you just take a quick glance.

Speaker 2:
Yes, just a quick glance is enough to get a rough idea.

Speaker 1:
Now we are at the intersection, there are quite a few cars here.

Speaker 1:
Now we are at a right turn intersection, can you describe the situation when you were turning?

Speaker 2:
When turning, I look both ways, but I focus more on the right side. Why? Because I'm afraid of oncoming traffic, not the traffic going in the same direction. Oncoming traffic is more dangerous.

Speaker 1:
Is it particularly common in Beijing, or?

Speaker 2:
It's the same everywhere. People break traffic rules all over the world. The most dangerous is not the traffic going in the same direction, but the oncoming traffic.

Speaker 1:
Because they are not in a normal lane.

Speaker 2:
Yes, they are not in a normal lane. For traffic going in the same direction, you can brake and the space will increase. But with oncoming traffic, you don't have time to react.

Speaker 1:
So when you turn right, you focus more on the right side.

Speaker 2:
Yes, because your field of vision on the left is larger. When you turn right, your field of vision on the left increases, but on the right, it decreases. So you focus more on the right side. Experienced drivers don't stare at one thing; they glance quickly. For example, when checking the left mirror, I just move my eyes, not my head.

Speaker 1:
Now we are in the traffic. Do you usually dislike these small non-motorized vehicles on the right side? Do you avoid them?

Speaker 2:
It's not about disliking them, it's about being afraid. It's not a matter of liking or disliking. Everyone has the right to use the road.
**Speaker 1:**
It's not about disliking it; it's about being afraid. It's not a matter of liking or disliking. On the road, everyone has the right of way. You realize that, right? Now, if you encounter a situation where someone is driving against traffic, what do you do? You should slow down, make space on the left, and also leave some room on the right. But what if there are cars on both sides?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, you need to make space for others. You can't just expect them to move for you. If you're driving against traffic, you're already in the wrong. The cars on your right are driving correctly.

**Speaker 1:**
Right, they are not breaking any rules. According to traffic laws, non-motorized vehicles have the right to use the road. If a car is parked on the right side, it's not their fault. If you hit them, you are fully responsible. When driving against traffic, you need to protect the more vulnerable road users. So, you have to decide which action is less risky.

**Speaker 1:**
So, in such a situation, how would you handle it?

**Speaker 2:**
In such cases, I would check my right mirror in advance. The technology in cars isn't that advanced yet. I would have already scanned the right side and confirmed there are no cars. Then, I would give way to the left. If there are cars on both sides, I would brake and stop, leaving space on both sides. I wouldn't dare to move forward. I would either brake or slow down, check the speed of the cars on both sides, and then decide. If the right side is clear, I would move to the right and let the left side pass.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you would let the left side pass first?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I would let the cars on the right, the ones driving correctly, pass first. If necessary, I would force the car on the left to stop by not giving it any space, making it stop. Then, I would let the right side pass. If the right side is clear, I would then let the left side pass.

**Speaker 1:**
In such a situation, you would already have your foot on the brake, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I would be constantly monitoring the right side. My foot would be on the brake, not the accelerator.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you would be driving at idle speed?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. My foot would be on the brake, ready to stop at any moment.

**Speaker 1:**
Next, let's talk about entering a side road.

**Speaker 1:**
If you were entering a side road, can you describe the signals and why you needed to act that way?

**Speaker 2:**
When entering a congested road, you see that the entrance isn't very long.
**Speaker 1:**
Could you describe the signals and why you needed to act that way during the driving process?

**Speaker 2:**
At that time, the road was congested. You see, the entrance wasn't particularly long, and the slope between the side road and the main road was quite extended. There were also cars coming out from that side, but there were bushes blocking the view. So, I would stay in the middle of the entrance and not immediately merge into the inner lane. I would slowly drive through that section first.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you would first stay to the right and drive through?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, between the two flower beds. My line of sight was there, so I would slow down. Why? Because I needed to make sure my mirrors were clear. Once I could see everything clearly, I would proceed.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you made sure there was enough space to see clearly and that there were no cars on the right.

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly. You can't just merge directly. If a car comes out and hits you, both cars would be at an angle, making it hard to determine who is at fault. When your car is straight, and you haven't merged directly, if the other car crosses the line, the responsibility is clearly theirs. You need to make sure all mirrors are clear before proceeding.

**Speaker 1:**
There was also a motorcycle at that time. What actions did you take regarding the motorcycle?

**Speaker 2:**
I heard the motorcycle's sound early on, so I didn't need to look. When I was merging into the main road, I had already seen the motorcycle. I knew it was there, so I slowed down naturally. I anticipated that the motorcycle would either make a U-turn or turn left, so I had already given way.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you anticipated its movement when you heard the sound getting closer?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, when I heard the sound getting closer, I had already given way. When the motorcycle cut in front of my car, I had already slowed down, allowing it to pass.

**Speaker 1:**
I noticed you checked the right mirror while making a U-turn. Why was that?

**Speaker 2:**
The right mirror was checked because the space was narrow, and I needed to move slightly to the right. If you look further, you'll see how I managed the U-turn.

**Speaker 1:**
I also saw you checking the left mirror during the U-turn.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because once you've checked the right side and it's clear, you don't need to look there again. Your car is already aligned, and there's no risk of collision from the right. The right side was clear of bicycles and electric scooters, so I only needed to check the left side for any incoming vehicles.
Speaker 1:
So, when you're driving, and the right side is clear—no bicycles or electric scooters—you only need to check the left side. If there's a chance of an electric scooter, a child, or another vehicle making a U-turn and squeezing into your lane, you have to stop even if you shouldn't have to.

Speaker 2:
Exactly. In the past, some other drivers didn't pay attention. Now, you see, you can make a turn in one go. Earlier, I checked the right side because I wanted to move closer to the right. Since there were no cars, I could move closer and even cross the line a bit without any issue. If you need to make a U-turn, it doesn't violate traffic rules, and you can do it in one go. When I turned the wheel fully, I paused for a moment to ensure I could make the turn smoothly. If you don't pause and your speed increases, you won't be able to make the turn in one go.

Speaker 1:
Now, we're driving straight. How should we handle this?

Speaker 1:
There were quite a few cars at that time. I saw a car in the rearview mirror. How did you handle the right turn?

Speaker 2:
Before making the right turn, you should have already checked how many heads were in the bushes, indicating how many cyclists there were. Based on their speed and your speed, you can decide whether to stop or go. If the bushes are high, you can only see part of the cyclist's body. As you move forward, you judge their speed along with yours. If you can't make the turn, you have to stop and let all the cars pass. Once you're sure there are no cars in your line of sight on the right, you can accelerate.

Speaker 1:
What if there's heavy traffic? Today, there might be fewer cars, but if there were a constant stream of bicycles and scooters, how would you handle it?

Speaker 2:
You just inch forward bit by bit. If there are a lot of bicycles, you move forward slowly until they give you space. During rush hours, especially near a school, there are many people picking up and dropping off children.

Speaker 1:
So, you stopped at that time.

Speaker 2:
Yes, you have to stop and let people pass before you move.

Speaker 1:
I've learned a lot about handling intersections.

Speaker 2:
Yes, and...

Speaker 1:
For example, if there's a taxi, what should you be aware of?

Speaker 2:
If the taxi is picking up passengers and has left enough space for you, you should ease off the gas and lightly brake to pass. If the taxi is dropping off passengers, you need to be cautious.
Speaker 2: He is an experienced driver. He has already left you enough space. At this moment, you should ease off the accelerator and gently apply the brakes to pass him. If he were a less experienced driver, you might need to be more cautious.

Speaker 1: How can you tell if someone is an experienced driver or not?

Speaker 2: Look, this person is moving forward. This isn't a taxi pulling over; this person is about to move. Before the taxi pulled over, there was nothing in front of it, no people or cars around, nothing to be cautious about.

Speaker 1: I see.

Speaker 2: Yes, you just need to observe. When you see something, the first step is always to ease off the accelerator and place your foot on the brake. Whether you press it or not is up to you.

Speaker 1: So, this is about to be a right turn. There's a person there.

Speaker 2: Yes, you should always observe in advance.

Speaker 1: Oh, so it's not just about observing at the last moment.

Speaker 2: Exactly, it's all about observing in advance. Most of the time, you won't need to react suddenly. I always observe in advance. You can see from my movements that I am constantly scanning the surroundings.

Speaker 1: So, you mean you start observing from a distance?

Speaker 2: Yes, exactly. Look, the red line is there. I've already scanned the area.

Speaker 1: You've already scanned it, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, it's all about observing in advance. By the time you get there, you don't need to look again.

Speaker 1: But you still need to be aware, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, but I already know what to focus on and where the potential hazards are. Before I start moving, I scan the area. I know there might be a bicycle at that intersection, or a group of people at another. Are they waiting for the light, chatting, or doing something else? If the light is about to turn green and I need to turn right or go straight, I need to be aware of potential cyclists. It's all about anticipating, not just reacting at the last moment.

Speaker 1: There's also a delivery vehicle over there.

Speaker 2: Yes, and you see, he glanced outward. When he did that, I started to slow down and apply the brakes. He might be avoiding something on his right, or maybe he's checking his phone. There are many possibilities, and you need to be prepared for all of them.

Speaker 2: At that moment, I had already eased off the accelerator and applied the brakes. I also checked my left mirror to ensure there was nothing there. It's all about ensuring safety.
Speaker 1: So, when you were swerving earlier, you checked the left mirror to ensure there was nothing on that side, right? 

Speaker 2: Yes, exactly. I made sure it was safe on both sides. At that moment, I had to decide whether to overtake or not. The decision was made in an instant, based on the speed and the situation ahead. I checked if I could see the front of his vehicle and his riding behavior before deciding to overtake.

Speaker 1: That sounds complicated. Can you recall the exact moment you decided to overtake him?

Speaker 2: To overtake him, you need to go back a bit. I had to be parallel with him. Not further back, but when I was right next to him. You see, at this point, I slowed down. About 20 meters before, I had already started to slow down. I honked the horn, and I was observing his right front side. I made sure he was driving straight and not swerving. I also checked that the right front side was clear, with no cars, children, or pedestrians, just some people standing there with packages. Only then did I decide to overtake him.

Speaker 1: So, you were parallel with him.

Speaker 2: Yes, and I was positioned very far to the left, almost in the opposite lane. I kept a safe distance so that even if he swerved, I could avoid him. That's when I decided to overtake.

Speaker 1: This is a critical maneuver. Was there a pedestrian crossing the road at that time?

Speaker 2: Yes, in such situations, you might need to ease off the accelerator. I noticed a delivery person earlier.

Speaker 1: There were quite a few on the road.

Speaker 2: Yes, this happens often. I remember he was on the phone and might have been about to make a U-turn.

Speaker 1: Would you still overtake in that situation?

Speaker 2: You see, I kept an eye on him. I noticed he saw me, and he was on the phone, stationary. So, I was 100% sure I could go. 

Speaker 1: So, you judged that he wouldn't move his car.

Speaker 2: Yes, he saw me, was on the phone, and his car was stationary. I had already honked to let him know where I was. At that point, I might ease off the accelerator but not brake, maintaining a steady speed. However, my foot was ready on the brake.

Speaker 1: So, about 20 meters before, you were already watching him closely to see what he was doing?

Speaker 2: Yes, to decide if it was safe to proceed.

Speaker 1: And there was an example nearby...
**Speaker 1:**
When you were braking, what was happening about 20 meters ahead? What was that person doing?

**Speaker 2:**
Could they move? Right.

**Speaker 1:**
There was an example nearby, not a routine one, just a normal person. There were also many taxis parked on the road. Can you describe the left turn you just made?

**Speaker 2:**
Sure, when you make a left turn, you need to check both side mirrors and observe the intersection on both sides.

**Speaker 1:**
Right, okay.

**Speaker 2:**
You see, I check the left mirror, the right mirror, then the left side of the intersection, and the right side. At this point, I ease off the gas and apply the brake while observing everything. If it's clear, then I make the turn. Why? Because when you turn left, you need to check the left mirror, the right mirror, and the road. Anything can happen, like an electric bike suddenly appearing from the left. So, you need to keep an eye on both sides. If there's an electric bike on the right, you need to watch out for that too. You have to be vigilant because anything can happen.

**Speaker 1:**
What speed should you maintain? Today, the traffic is not too bad, but when there are more cars?

**Speaker 2:**
When there are more cars, you need to match the speed of the traffic in front of you.

**Speaker 1:**
What speed?

**Speaker 2:**
You need to consider the speed of the cars on both sides. If there's a car on your right, you might need to stop. You have to assess the situation at that moment to decide your speed. If there's danger, it's not excessive to stop. If it's clear, you can give it a bit of gas and go through. You need to constantly judge the situation. For example, if you're turning left and there's no car on the left but a car coming straight on the right, if you collide, it's entirely your fault. But if you see the car on the right is moving slowly and seems to be yielding, you can accelerate and go through. Once you straighten your car after the turn, any collision would be their fault because you have the right of way.

**Speaker 1:**
There are a lot of parked cars on the side of the road. Are you afraid someone might suddenly dash out?

**Speaker 2:**
I am afraid, but you need to make judgments.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you judge every car?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, you have to judge every car. For example, if the right side is clear and you see the brake lights of the car in front of you, you should already be slowing down and have your foot ready on the brake. You should also use the horn to alert others.

**Speaker 1:**
What about the garbage truck?

**Speaker 2:**
The garbage truck is stationary, and there are no people around it.

**Speaker 1:**
It doesn't...
Speaker 1:
You know, what about that garbage truck?

Speaker 2:
The garbage truck is stationary, and there's no one around it.

Speaker 1:
It doesn't have any lights on.

Speaker 2:
Yes, you see, you can't tell if there's someone inside just by looking. The presence or absence of a person makes a difference.

Speaker 1:
Right, always scanning.

Speaker 2:
Yes, always scanning. Look at that garbage truck, it's just parked there, not moving. The feeling is different when there's someone inside versus when there's no one.

Speaker 1:
The left side is quite narrow. Which side did you lean towards when you were driving?

Speaker 2:
I always use the middle lane when it's a dashed line. You can only use the dashed line, but even with a solid line, you sometimes have to use it. The police won't say anything if you need to use it because the road is too narrow and there are too many cars.

Speaker 1:
I noticed you glanced at the right side before preparing to turn left.

Speaker 2:
Yes, when turning left, you need to check the right side to see if any cars are coming. I always check the mirrors. One glance and you know if there are any cars. If you keep staring at one side, you won't see the other side.

Speaker 1:
When turning left, do you focus more on the left or the right?

Speaker 2:
You need to check both sides. You have to make sure there are no obstacles or people. Even when driving on ring roads, you need to check the narrow emergency lanes on the right. Motorcycles and electric bikes can come out of nowhere, and you won't hear them. Sometimes you need to rely on sound to judge their distance and direction.

Speaker 1:
There is sound, though.

Speaker 2:
Yes, you can judge the distance and direction of a motorcycle by its sound. You can tell if it's close or far, on your left or right, and if it's approaching.

Speaker 1:
I noticed the driver honked the horn in the surveillance footage.

Speaker 2:
Yes, the driver honks when necessary.

Speaker 1:
The roads here are quite narrow, and there was a car in front of you. I saw you quickly scanned both sides.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I scanned both sides because the car was driving close to the middle.
Speaker 1: There's a car in front of you. I noticed you quickly scanned both sides just now.

Speaker 2: Yes, I scanned both sides. I need to judge the situation. You see, that car is driving close to the center. I need to determine if anything might come out from behind that truck. I need to decide whether to stop or proceed and at what speed. Should I change lanes or just follow behind? I have to consider all these factors.

Speaker 1: And suddenly, there are so many turns here.

Speaker 2: Yes, that's why I slowed down and left enough space for them to pass safely. At this point, I also need to check if there are any parked cars ahead. If the road is clear, I can proceed. If the car in front doesn't move back to its lane and continues to block the way, I have to keep my speed low.

Speaker 1: I see, you need to anticipate the other driver's intentions.

Speaker 2: Exactly, you need to judge what they plan to do. If they intend to turn left, I need to check if there's an entrance to a residential area on the left. Are they going home or somewhere else?

Speaker 1: The cars on the side are prone to scratches, right?

Speaker 2: Not really. I don't feel that way because I always avoid and yield when necessary.

Speaker 1: There was a person just now. Did you slow down or take any action when you saw them?

Speaker 2: Oh, you mean that person? I saw them and judged it was safe to pass.

Speaker 1: So you felt it was safe to proceed?

Speaker 2: Yes, I saw them looking at their phone. They were probably a ride-hailing driver checking for new requests and didn't have time to move.

Speaker 1: Now we are approaching an intersection without traffic lights.

Speaker 1: Can you describe your right turn just now?

Speaker 2: Sure, I saw someone standing still at the right corner and a white car approaching from the left. I had already slowed down in advance. I followed the white car closely and made the turn. If you look back, you might see someone standing far away, but in reality, they are not that close.

Speaker 1: There was some distance.

Speaker 2: Yes, there was a significant distance. You see, they weren't moving.

Speaker 1: Oh, you also checked the side mirror.

Speaker 2: Yes, I had to check for bicycles or electric scooters.

Speaker 1: It's similar to when you exited the parking lot and turned right onto the service road.

Speaker 2: Exactly, you need to be aware of any electric scooters coming from the right.
Speaker 1: When we were leaving the parking lot and making a right turn onto the side road, it was a similar situation, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, you need to check if there are any electric bikes coming from your right. You have to look at the person, then check the rearview mirror, and then look again. Just like I did earlier, I checked once, then looked to the left again. You have to be thorough.

Speaker 1: I noticed you were scanning left and right. Were you trying to decide which lane to take? You see that red dot?

Speaker 2: There's nothing special about it, just being cautious. I checked the rearview mirror because I wanted to stay close to the right without crowding anyone. If there's a car behind in a hurry, they might try to overtake you quickly. You have to be aware of these situations.

Speaker 2: When you reverse, you need to anticipate because you want to make a right turn. There was a Jeep on the left, which is tall and creates a blind spot.

Speaker 1: Where is the blind spot?

Speaker 2: When you reverse, you'll notice it. Look, why do you think I was looking over there? Did you see the red dot? I was observing that person. This position is crucial because something might come from the front of the Jeep. When you make a right turn, the front of your car has a blind spot. I was checking in advance to see if anything was coming from the left. After checking, you can proceed normally. I checked again to make sure nothing was coming from either side. This is about dealing with blind spots. When you make a right turn, the left lane often has many cars. If you can't see the front left clearly, it can be dangerous. Right now, there are fewer cars because it's not rush hour.

Speaker 2: During rush hour, try driving over the Zhongguancun Bridge. It's packed with electric bikes and bicycles on your right, and you can't see anything. Plus, there are buses blocking your view. When making a right turn, you have to inch forward slowly until you can see clearly and ensure it's safe before proceeding.

Speaker 1: There's no other way.

Speaker 2: Exactly, there's no other way. Honestly, the traffic laws in China are 100% designed for drivers. They don't consider pedestrians or cyclists. Even if they are at fault, they are still considered the vulnerable group. You just have to deal with it.

Speaker 1: Oh, and there's a cleaning vehicle here.

Speaker 2: Yes, the cleaning vehicle. When I was at a distance, I saw a red dot and checked the side mirror. You should be able to see it too. I already checked the left mirror.
Speaker 1:
When I was some distance away, I saw a red dot. I glanced at it and checked the rearview mirror. At that moment, I should have been able to see it. I had already checked the left side mirror and confirmed there were no cars. So, I moved to the left to let it pass. Yes, that's how I managed to get through. Then, I saw another red dot on the left.

Speaker 2:
That was about 30 to 40 meters away. I had already checked the left side and confirmed there were no cars. You need to prepare in advance. You can't wait until you're right behind the car to check. That's too late. I knew from 30 to 40 meters away. You see, this car was definitely moving slowly. There were parked cars on the right, so it couldn't move to the side. At that moment, you instinctively need to check the left side.

Speaker 2:
Once you confirm, you see the trajectory going around the car from the rear to the front. There was also a person there. You went around the rear of the car and checked the front. You had already observed in advance. Once confirmed, you should decelerate, not accelerate. Your foot should be on the brake.

Speaker 2:
You also checked the right side. At this point, you should look at the left side mirror and start moving from the rear to the front of the car. You need to keep an eye on it. If you weren't watching, wouldn't it have startled you when someone appeared?

Speaker 1:
Yes, there are many situations like this.

Speaker 2:
When you turn right, you can see clearly in the rearview mirror. You also observe the person clearly. You need to keep an eye on them. When did they pass? Can you turn?

Speaker 1:
Does this count as a situation? What do you think about such people?

Speaker 2:
You need to see it on-site to understand. There is a certain distance, not just the distance from the rearview mirror but from the front of the car. It's quite far. So, the footage and the actual scene are different.

Speaker 1:
Yes, it's about judging the distance.

Speaker 2:
I have a sense of distance. You see, this woman was swaying back and forth. When she started moving towards the middle, I honked and slowed down. I was already watching the car in front.

Speaker 1:
I remember you honked when you were reversing.

Speaker 2:
Yes.

Speaker 1:
How do you usually handle such situations? Just wait?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I wait until I'm sure they are aware and have moved to the side before I proceed.

Speaker 1:
What about the oncoming car?

Speaker 2:
I keep my eyes on the driver's face, not just the car. I need to see their eyes to understand their intentions.
Speaker 1:
When reversing, I focus on the driver's face, not the car. Why do I look at his eyes? To see his intentions, his expressions, or at least half of his face. This helps me understand if he knows I'm coming through. Staring at the car doesn't help.

Speaker 2:
And this area is quite narrow, right?

Speaker 1:
Yes, it is.

Speaker 2:
So, instead of focusing on the car, you need to see how much space he has and whether you can pass.

Speaker 1:
But road rights seem to be important here.

Speaker 2:
Forget about road rights when driving in China, especially in Beijing. You only consider road rights if you're determined to crash. Experienced drivers judge whether they can pass without considering road rights. If I can let you pass, I will, because while my skills might be fine, I can't guarantee the other driver's skills. It's best to avoid accidents. Even if the other driver is 100% at fault, you still have to repair your car, which takes time. So, if you can yield, just yield.

Speaker 1:
What if you have important passengers, like a leader, in the car?

Speaker 2:
In that case, I would be even more cautious. I would move closer to the edge earlier. I always check the right mirror to ensure there's no one or no car before I occupy the right side completely. This way, nothing can pass, reducing the risk of collision. If a bicycle tries to squeeze through and hits your mirror, you can't argue with them. They might even blame you for hurting their hand. So, occupy the space firmly to prevent others from trying to squeeze through.

Speaker 1:
So, you would move closer to the edge even earlier?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I would. I always check the curb to judge the distance and width. I decide whether to stay close to the edge and assess the speed of the other vehicle to determine if I need to brake. When making a right turn, I check the right mirror first, then quickly shift my gaze to the middle of the road to see if anything is coming.

Speaker 1:
In situations with fewer cars, how do you ensure the comfort of your passengers?

Speaker 2:
Comfort is ensured by anticipating and observing early. This way, you can adjust your speed and movements smoothly.
**Interviewer:** In situations where there are fewer cars, how do you ensure the comfort of your passengers?

**Driver:** Comfort, yes. You need to observe in advance. Check if your speed is appropriate. Should you accelerate or maintain a steady pace? You need to observe both sides. For example, if you see a pedestrian early on, you should start slowing down. 

**Interviewer:** At what distance do you start observing?

**Driver:** You should start slowing down early and adjust your direction while observing. If you need to move to the left, you should check the situation on the opposite side and the left side. By the time you get closer, you should have already noticed any potential obstacles. For instance, if you see a pedestrian, you should have already started slowing down.

**Interviewer:** How do you maintain a smooth and comfortable speed in such situations?

**Driver:** By anticipating early, you can ease off the accelerator. If you get too close, you would have to brake suddenly, which is not comfortable. 

**Interviewer:** Right, so you anticipate early.

**Driver:** Yes, you anticipate early. For example, if you see a car parked by the roadside, you should start easing off the accelerator. If you notice a pedestrian, you should be ready to brake. If the pedestrian looks at you, you know they have seen you, and you can decide whether to maintain your speed or brake.

**Interviewer:** So, you judge their intentions based on their behavior?

**Driver:** Exactly. Like with the woman earlier, I watched her face to see if she noticed my car. If she was looking at my car, I knew she was aware of my presence. I maintained a steady speed and only accelerated after passing her and checking my mirrors to ensure she hadn't moved.

**Interviewer:** What about turning left?

**Driver:** When turning left, you need to constantly check both sides, especially if there are no traffic lights. Make sure it's clear before making the turn.
Speaker 2:
Because there are no traffic lights, you have to look both ways, make sure it's clear, and then make your turn. Driving in Beijing requires decisiveness. If you're sure, you need to go for it. Hesitation can easily lead to danger.

Speaker 1:
Hesitation makes it more likely.

Speaker 2:
Exactly. For instance, when you're overtaking, if you've gauged the distance and honked to signal your intention, and the other driver acknowledges it, you need to accelerate and overtake decisively. If you hesitate, another car might come from the opposite direction, and by the time you brake, it might be too late. The large vehicle you're overtaking might also slow down, making it even harder for you to complete the maneuver.

Speaker 2:
Also, your car has a certain range for making decisions. If you don't merge properly and get hit, it's hard to determine fault. But if you merge and then get hit, the other driver is at fault. Every industry has its unwritten rules, and driving is no different. Experienced drivers know how to minimize their liability.

Speaker 1:
The rules aren't rigid.

Speaker 2:
Right, the rules aren't rigid. For example, when merging, if I slightly move into your lane and then get hit, it can be hard for the police to determine fault. It's about who can explain the situation better.

Speaker 1:
I honked today because I wanted to overtake.

Speaker 2:
I noticed there was no one on the left, so I wasn't planning to overtake. But if you wait for the other driver to move to the side, you can then pass.

Speaker 1:
I was watching that driver.

Speaker 2:
His speed was very slow, almost stopping at the intersection. I honked to remind him to either move or stop. After I honked, he slowly moved to the side.

Speaker 1:
You forced him to take action.

Speaker 2:
It's not about forcing. Especially with taxi drivers, there's a mutual understanding communicated through honking. It signals that you're coming from behind and that they need to be aware of their slow speed.
Speaker 1:
One way to communicate is by using the horn. For example, if I'm coming from behind and I notice that the car in front is moving slowly, I can honk to let the driver know. They usually understand and give me a clear signal, so I can pass them safely.

Speaker 2:
If it's a car with a "new driver" sticker, I won't honk. I'll just wait patiently. If I can overtake them safely, I will. Each situation requires a different judgment.

Speaker 1:
Does it matter what type of car it is or who is driving?

Speaker 2:
Yes, it does. For instance, taxi drivers are usually experienced. If you honk at them, they understand what you want to do.

Speaker 1:
When you bought your car, did you often have to slow down or stop?

Speaker 2:
Yes, sometimes I had to stop completely.

Speaker 1:
What about when there's a bus?

Speaker 2:
You need to observe carefully. Look at the right side of the bus. If there are many lines painted on the road, it means the bus might be stopping to pick up or drop off passengers. You need to see if the bus has its left turn signal on, indicating it’s about to leave the stop.

Speaker 1:
What do you do if the bus is dropping off passengers?

Speaker 2:
If the bus is dropping off passengers, you need to be cautious. People might suddenly appear from the front of the bus. You should focus on the front wheels of the bus because that's where people will emerge from. Always watch the gap between the front wheels and the front of the bus. People’s feet will appear first, so you need to be ready to stop.

Speaker 1:
So, you watch the front wheels?

Speaker 2:
Yes, always watch the front wheels and the gap between the wheels and the front of the bus. This gap is large enough to see if someone is about to step out. This is true for both large and small vehicles. Sometimes, when there are many cars lined up, you need to be extra cautious. If a car ahead of you suddenly swerves, you need to be prepared. It's all about intuition and experience. You can often tell if a car is about to move by looking at its front wheels. If the wheels are turned, the car is likely to move. You can also watch the rear of the car; if it sways, the car might be about to change lanes.
Speaker 1:
I noticed you were already paying attention early on.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I always start early. You have to be proactive.

Speaker 1:
Haha, what are you looking out for?

Speaker 2:
I check for any potential issues. You can't just switch to the side road without knowing what's ahead, right? You need to be aware of the situation.

Speaker 1:
I see. I noticed there were about 12, 13, or 14 cars.

Speaker 2:
Yes, it was around 50 to 80 meters ahead. You need to keep an eye on things even when you're not actively driving.

Speaker 1:
Oh, so you look ahead to anticipate any issues. Right?

Speaker 2:
Absolutely. You can't wait until you reach the intersection to start looking. If there's nothing in front of you and no cars on your right, you need to be aware of your surroundings.

Speaker 1:
There were quite a few pedestrians. How did you handle that?

Speaker 2:
If people are walking properly, you just follow behind them. 

Speaker 1:
What scenario are you most afraid of encountering?

Speaker 2:
I'm not really afraid because I make sure to observe everything. Experienced drivers can predict what each person or car will do next. You can be about 80-90% sure of their actions. Once you've observed, you know if someone is going to turn, go straight, stop, or look at their phone. My eyes are always scanning, so I know what everyone is going to do next. There's nothing to be afraid of. Even if you're a meter away, you're still safe. If someone is walking, your speed matches theirs, and when you turn, they won't be in your way. If they move to the right, you know they're getting on the sidewalk. You can safely accelerate and move on. Always keep observing, especially the right side. You need to check the right mirror frequently.

Speaker 1:
Earlier, there were two instances where you checked the handles at around 10 minutes and 18 seconds. Is that right? It might not be exactly 18 seconds, but around that time. You need to anticipate at least 10 seconds ahead, maybe even more. I'm not sure exactly which road it was.
Speaker 1:
"At 10 minutes and 18 seconds, right? But it might not be exactly 18 seconds, maybe a few seconds before or after. Yes, at least 10 seconds before or after. I'm not quite sure about the exact location on the road. It's roughly around the 10-minute mark, but not exactly 18 seconds because there's no precise timestamp. It's approximately during this stretch of the road. There was a passenger, probably the one in the back seat, who pressed the handle, their handle."

Speaker 2:
"Are you talking about the woman riding in the middle? At that time, there was a woman riding a horse in front, right? By then, I had already slowed down because I knew there was a car on the left and a car ahead with a child. He might have been scared of a special situation occurring, I understand."

Speaker 1:
"And then there's another time at 11 minutes and 34 seconds on this road segment."

Speaker 2:
"At that time, someone pressed the handle again. Was it the garbage truck? Maybe it was the garbage truck, and someone got out, which scared him. Yes, it was the garbage truck. Someone suddenly appeared from the truck, and he pressed the handle again out of fear. But I had already kept a safe distance and had already stopped."

Speaker 1:
"Okay, so that's what we observed in the video. Next, we have a few more questions. Could you describe your actions during straight-line driving? For example, what speed do you usually maintain?"

Speaker 2:
"If the speed limit is 80, I drive at 80. If it's 80, I try to maintain 80. My habit, like that of many experienced drivers, is to drive as fast as the limit allows when possible and slow down when necessary. Unlike some new drivers who might be afraid to drive at the limit and go at 60 when the limit is 80, which can cause congestion. If everyone drives at 80 or the normal speed, there are no issues. But if you drive at 80 and the car in front of you is at 60, you have to change lanes, which causes all the cars in that lane to slow down. When you change lanes, you inevitably slow down, right? Then you accelerate again to overtake, causing both lanes to slow down. So, our habit is to drive at 80 when we can. If the limit is 60, we drive at 60. But under normal road conditions, you can't always do that, so you have to change lanes frequently because there are too many slow drivers now."

Speaker 1:
"I also wanted to ask, in the video today, we didn't see many instances of you overtaking. Do you usually like to overtake when driving?"

Speaker 2:
"It's not about liking or disliking. It's just that my driving habit, developed over many years, prioritizes safety. I overtake only when necessary."
**Speaker 1:**
There's no particular preference, it's just that our current driving habits, which I've developed over many years, prioritize safety above all. I overtake for safety, I slow down for safety. Sometimes, when I overtake, new drivers might not understand why. For instance, if I'm driving on the Fourth Ring Road and there's a car ahead going 50 km/h with no other cars in sight for 500 meters, why would I overtake it? First, because it's driving too slowly, and second, because I don't want to follow it. There might be cars behind me that are in a hurry. Suddenly, a car from behind might speed up to 80 km/h and overtake me, and if I continue at 50 km/h, I might end up at 45 km/h. Then, if another car comes speeding at 80 km/h, it might not be able to stop in time and could crash into me.

**Speaker 2:**
For safety, I overtake. If I overtake, I can maintain the same speed as the cars in front. For example, if the cars ahead are going 70 km/h, I can follow at 60-70 km/h. Everyone's speed is consistent, and there's no problem. When traffic is slow, it's the same. But if everyone is driving fast and there's one slow car, not overtaking it can be dangerous over time. So, overtaking is for safety.

**Speaker 1:**
I see. If a leader has an urgent matter, would you often overtake?

**Speaker 2:**
You drive as you should. If you need to speed up, you do so. But even if the leader is in a hurry, you must ensure their 100% safety. Safety is always the priority. Speeding up is fine, but safety must be guaranteed.

**Speaker 1:**
I have a few more questions. Not related to the video, but you can refer to it if needed. To ensure safety during this drive, what did you particularly pay attention to?

**Speaker 2:**
What did I pay attention to? I followed my usual driving habits, which have been formed over many years with safety as the priority. My driving habits are well-established, so there's nothing specific to pay extra attention to. Once I get in the car, I maintain that state.

**Speaker 1:**
If you're at an intersection with bicycles, pedestrians, and cars, and you need to make a right turn, what would you focus on the most?

**Speaker 2:**
I pay attention to everything.

**Speaker 1:**
Is there a priority?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles have priority. Why? Because they are vulnerable groups, and you must yield to them. As a driver, you have to ensure their safety.
**Speaker 1:**
Do pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles have priority?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, they do. Why? Because they are vulnerable groups, and you should yield to them. If I'm in a car, as long as I'm within the proper lane, I would rather stop and let pedestrians go first. Once they have crossed and the road is clear, I proceed.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it. How do you think one can drive more safely?

**Speaker 2:**
First, you need to stay calm and relaxed. If you can relax both your mind and body, you will drive better. Many people get nervous when they start driving, and the more nervous you are, the more likely you are to make mistakes.

**Speaker 1:**
What kind of problems can nervousness cause?

**Speaker 2:**
Nervousness can lead to various issues. You might press the wrong pedal, like hitting the brake when you should be accelerating, or vice versa. You might not steer correctly or misjudge distances. When you're tense, your body becomes stiff, and you can't perform actions properly.

**Speaker 1:**
Besides mindset, what else can make driving safer?

**Speaker 2:**
Apart from mindset, experience and speed control are crucial. Many people take their foot off the gas but don't place it on the brake. Our habit is to move our foot to the brake pedal as soon as we release the gas, even if we don't press it. This way, we can react 0.5 seconds faster if we need to brake. Many people don't do this; they release the gas but keep their foot far from the brake. Our habit is to always have the foot ready on the brake when not pressing the gas.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think self-driving cars are safe now?

**Speaker 2:**
I don't think they are 100% safe.

**Speaker 1:**
What kind of self-driving car would be safe?

**Speaker 2:**
I think they should still work in conjunction with human drivers. They should be more of an assistive technology. If they take full control, it might not be very reliable unless 100% of the cars on the road are self-driving, with no human drivers at all.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you're saying...

**Speaker 2:**
If all the rules are the same and everyone is on parallel paths with no intersections, it could be safe. Also, pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles should be separated from motor vehicles because you can't predict their movements.

**Speaker 1:**
You think cars can be controlled, but...

**Speaker 2:**
People are harder to control.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you recall any driving situations that particularly scared you, especially in urban driving conditions like today?
Speaker 1:
Could you recall any driving situations that particularly scare you? Especially on city roads, like today's driving conditions, what specific scenarios make you anxious?

Speaker 2:
What scares me the most are the numerous blind spots. For example, near large courtyards, in front of buses, or large trucks.

Speaker 1:
By blind spots, do you mean areas where people might suddenly appear?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. People suddenly popping out, like a "ghost head" appearing out of nowhere. Also, wrong-way drivers, especially at intersections where they might turn into your path while you're going straight.

Speaker 1:
So, one issue is people suddenly appearing, and another is wrong-way drivers who take up your right of way.

Speaker 2:
Yes, they take up your right of way. It's very concerning.

Speaker 1:
Especially when they are driving recklessly in the wrong direction.

Speaker 2:
It's not just reckless; it's that you can't see them clearly. Especially at night, when there are many turns. For instance, you're making a right turn, and suddenly a woman on a bike comes from the wrong direction. She might be turning right into your path. You suddenly see a dark shadow in front of you, and instinctively hit the brakes. The car stops, and you realize there's someone there. It gives you a fright, and you break into a cold sweat.

Speaker 1:
Besides these sudden appearances and wrong-way drivers, are there any other situations that scare you?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I'm also afraid of trucks driving in the early morning hours. You know, around 4 or 5 AM, or 5 or 6 AM. These trucks have been driving all night, delivering goods from one place to another. There are no police around at that time, and they are not restricted from driving.

Speaker 1:
Why are you afraid of them?

Speaker 2:
They've been driving all night and are exhausted. Around 4 or 5 AM, or 5 or 6 AM, is when they are the most tired. Sometimes the sun is just rising, and in summer, it can be blinding. They become even more tired. How do you usually deal with this? I try to stay far away from them. If I can't, I overtake them quickly. If they are swerving in the middle of the road, I give them a wide berth and accelerate past them. It's safer that way. Otherwise, I keep a safe distance and drive slowly.
Speaker 1:
So, you just hit the gas and overtook them, leaving them behind. That way, you're safe. Otherwise, you should keep a good distance. I prefer to drive a bit slower. I always say, keep your distance, and I will never drive in the same lane as you.

Speaker 2:
Got it. Besides sudden pedestrian appearances and wrong-way drivers, what other scenarios make you nervous, especially with large trucks in the early morning? Based on your experience.

Speaker 1:
There aren't many other scary scenarios. During holidays, the scariest thing is the influx of new drivers. Many are still learning, leading to numerous accidents, either rear-end collisions or scrapes.

Speaker 2:
Yes, it's the inexperienced drivers that are worrisome. Nowadays, there are too many new drivers, and I feel that driving school instructors are just focused on getting students their licenses quickly. They don't teach properly. Unlike when we learned to drive, we had a thorough three-month training period, and only after passing the exams could we drive on the road. Now, the training is like instant coffee, very rushed.

Speaker 1:
Do you think you have any bad driving habits that could be dangerous?

Speaker 2:
At this point, I don't have many bad habits. Occasionally, I might check my phone, but generally, I'm a relaxed driver and somewhat confident. However, this habit of checking my phone isn't good.

Speaker 1:
When you're a passenger, what behaviors from other drivers make you nervous?

Speaker 2:
I rarely ride with others, especially if I'm not familiar with them. If I have to take a taxi, I tell the driver to take it easy because I'm not in a hurry. Any behavior from an unfamiliar driver makes me nervous because everyone has different judgment. Unless it's someone I know well and trust, I feel uneasy. With familiar, experienced drivers, I can even sleep in the car without worry. But with strangers, I'm always anxious.

Speaker 1:
We noticed some eye movement in the video we recorded earlier, showing some dangerous scenarios. Did you pay attention to the passengers during those moments? We had a few passengers in the car, did you notice them?
**Speaker 1:**
During the challenging driving scenario, did you pay attention to the passengers? I noticed that we had a few passengers in the car.

**Speaker 2:**
Oh, yes, I did pay attention to them. I observed that the passenger in the back was quite relaxed at first. The one in the front seemed relaxed as well, although I noticed he adjusted his posture a couple of times, possibly due to some back pain. He also played with his hands and checked his phone a couple of times. As for the passenger in the back, I couldn't see much of him, just half of his face.

**Speaker 1:**
Besides today's passengers, how do you usually monitor your passengers?

**Speaker 2:**
When driving important people, I observe everything. Typically, when I drive a GL8, the leader sits in the middle seat. I use the electronic rearview mirror to keep an eye on the road and the passengers. If I notice the leader is asleep, I drive more smoothly and avoid sudden movements. If the leader is on a call, I close the windows and adjust the air conditioning to keep the environment quiet.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you usually consider the passengers' experience while driving?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I do.

**Speaker 1:**
Given your extensive experience, how do you ensure that passengers don't feel anxious or uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Avoid sudden braking, maintain a safe distance from other vehicles, and avoid sudden acceleration.

**Speaker 1:**
So, do you think that if you feel the ride is smooth, the passengers will feel the same? Or do you adjust based on their reactions?

**Speaker 2:**
With my current level of experience, I can confidently say that if I feel the ride is smooth, it generally is. However, it's important to remember that everyone has different sensitivities. What I consider a normal acceleration might feel abrupt to a passenger. When driving during peak hours with more traffic, I always ensure to leave enough space between my car and the one in front, at least one car length.
**Speaker 1:**
When there are a lot of cars, especially during rush hours, you should always leave a gap in front of your car. At least one car length of space.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. One car length of space. Whether you're changing lanes, merging, or if the car in front suddenly brakes, always keep that one car length of space. It ensures a smoother and safer drive. You won't need to brake suddenly, and it gives you more reaction time.

**Speaker 1:**
So, during heavy traffic, maintaining a car length distance is crucial.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, at least one car length. It allows you to make comfortable and safe decisions.

**Speaker 1:**
That's the best practice, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, ideally, you should consider the length of a vehicle like a GL8, which is about 6 meters long. Keeping at least that distance is the best judgment, especially during peak hours when cars are constantly changing lanes.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think are some bad driving habits that might make passengers uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Habits like sudden acceleration, sudden braking, looking at your phone, or taking calls. These can make passengers feel uneasy.

**Speaker 1:**
When you're a passenger in someone else's car, what behaviors make you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
The same things: erratic lane changes, sudden braking, sudden acceleration, and not maintaining a proper distance. It’s unsettling.

**Speaker 1:**
Considering passenger comfort, what do you pay special attention to while driving to ensure they don't feel anxious or stressed?

**Speaker 2:**
I pay close attention to the speed and maintain a steady control. I avoid sudden accelerations and decelerations. I also make sure to anticipate situations well in advance, observing the surroundings from 40-50 meters away.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, moving on to the next topic. What do you think makes a good or professional driver?

**Speaker 2:**
A professional driver must have solid driving skills. Their driving technique should be reliable and consistent.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you elaborate on what you mean by good driving skills?

**Speaker 2:**
Good driving skills mean being able to handle the vehicle smoothly and safely in various situations. For example, even when taking a call, a skilled driver can maintain control and ensure safety.
**Speaker 1:**
What do you think are the essential qualities a professional driver should have?

**Speaker 2:**
To judge a professional driver, you can tell from their posture and driving state how many years they've been driving. First, you see if the person is relaxed, not tense. Also, is the start smooth?

**Speaker 1:**
A smooth start.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, is the start smooth? When turning, do they accelerate or brake abruptly?

**Speaker 1:**
A seasoned driver won't accelerate abruptly when turning.

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly. They always start slowing down at least 200 meters before an intersection. Their foot is already on the brake. A seasoned driver focuses on two things: observing more and not rushing. They know when to accelerate and overtake smoothly. It's not just about pressing the gas pedal; it's about knowing when to brake. They understand when to slow down and when to speed up.

**Speaker 1:**
It's about timing.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, timing. We always say to ease off the gas and be ready to brake.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think is the biggest difference between an experienced driver and a novice?

**Speaker 2:**
The biggest difference is experience. For example, I know from 50 meters away what I should be looking at. From 100 meters away, I can already judge the situation. If a car is parked, I can predict whether it will move or if someone might step out in front of it. 

**Speaker 1:**
You can predict what the car will do from 50 meters away?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, when approaching an intersection, I scan the area and know what everyone is likely to do. The difference lies in experience and intuition. It's about making predictions in advance.

**Speaker 1:**
Being prepared in advance.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it's about making good predictions. If I predict well, I can reduce the accident rate by 99%. No one can guarantee 100%, but good predictions significantly lower the risk.
**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it's about anticipation. If I anticipate well, I can reduce 99% of accidents. I can't guarantee 100%, and I can't say I've never had an accident in my entire driving life, but minor scrapes are inevitable.

**Speaker 1:**
Have you ever ridden in a self-driving car?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I haven't. I'm too scared to try. My wife and son have, though.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think you understand autonomous driving? To what extent?

**Speaker 2:**
I have a decent understanding, though not very deep. I've used various systems like L2, lane-keeping assist, lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control, and so on. But they don't always work perfectly.

**Speaker 1:**
In what ways do you think autonomous cars can never match human drivers?

**Speaker 2:**
Humans? I think it's impossible for them to be 100% human-like. Computers are too linear. For example, should you overtake at this moment? Sometimes you have to break the rules. If a computer detects you're crossing a line, it will consider it a violation. But as a human, if there's a hazard, you might need to cross the line for safety. A computer might not make that judgment.

**Speaker 1:**
In terms of traffic rules?

**Speaker 2:**
Flexibility, yes. If there's a traffic cop and a dangerous situation ahead, you might need to break a rule to avoid an accident. You can explain it to the cop because they are human and understand the context. But a computer can't do that.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else that autonomous driving can't achieve?

**Speaker 2:**
It's about anticipation. I can sense when a garbage truck might have people coming out from behind it. I can anticipate and adjust my driving accordingly. 

**Speaker 1:**
What if it's not a garbage truck but a small car?

**Speaker 2:**
If it's a small car, you can see over it more easily. But the larger the vehicle, the bigger the blind spot.

**Speaker 1:**
So, the larger the vehicle, the bigger the blind spot?

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly.
Speaker 2:
If you're driving a small car, you can see better, right? Especially when riding a bicycle.

Speaker 1:
The bigger the vehicle...

Speaker 2:
The bigger the vehicle in front of you, the larger the blind spot. You need to be aware of this. You should always be cautious and anticipate potential dangers, whether it's a pedestrian or another vehicle. Always observe the left side, and if you can avoid it, do so. The goal is to minimize the risk. Even if you avoid a potential danger 10 times and only once it actually happens, it’s worth it.

Speaker 1:
How do you judge the intentions of other pedestrians, cyclists, or vehicles while driving?

Speaker 2:
It's all about intuition, something you develop over time. Computers can't learn this. When three cars are moving side by side, I can judge their movements and predict what they might do next.

Speaker 1:
What about parked cars? You mentioned earlier that you look at the front wheels. Is that correct?

Speaker 2:
Yes, you observe the front and rear of the car, as well as the left and right sides. A quick glance can tell you if the car is stationary, waiting for someone, or about to move. The condition of the lights is also something you should observe.

Speaker 1:
Alright, those are all my questions. Do you have anything to add?

Speaker 2:
No, I don't have anything to add.

Speaker 1:
Thank you for your time.

Speaker 2:
You're welcome. Thank you.

Speaker 1:
Thank you for participating.
