**Transcript:**

**Speaker 1:**
We don't need to look, right? Just review in time, thanks.

**Speaker 2:**
Apart from this test drive, other tests aren't good either.

**Speaker 1:**
Hmm, it shouldn't be that complicated at the moment. Yes, considering safety, but some are even less likely. Just sitting at the computer for a week watching videos. Yes, risk.

**Speaker 2:**
There are also scenarios, especially if you're paying attention in mountainous areas.

**Speaker 1:**
Those should be algorithm tests. This side is currently quite far. This is for you to see, master. Let's discuss this first.

**Speaker 1:**
This indicator light should be slightly lower than normal when driving.

**Speaker 2:**
Just calibrated, it should be clear now. I've called countless times, let's start in the end.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, because this point records what you just saw in the device. If you remember seeing something different, you can tell us anytime. Yes, we can manually adjust this point to the direction you remember, whether it's the x-axis or y-axis. The sun is too bright today, which can also affect it. Hello, hello.

**Speaker 1:**
Hello, hello, is this it? Turn on the computer, then.

**Speaker 2:**
Actually, the phone should be very clear.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, the master also said a word.

**Speaker 2:**
You also said, hello, hello, way, hello, hello.

**Speaker 1:**
Is it okay? Okay, just like this. Alright, then we are ready to start, right? Now we officially begin our final interview session. My name is Changxiang, and I will be responsible for the final interview session today. We will watch the video recorded by the eye tracker together, and we can explore your driving habits. You can stop and discuss with us anytime you find something interesting. If there are any points I find interesting or worth discussing, I will also pause.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, we don't need to be too restrained, just relax. Say whatever you want to say. If there are any questions you find inconvenient or sensitive, you can choose not to answer. Just let me know. I want to emphasize again that all data will be processed anonymously, and we will not disclose your personal privacy. Okay, let me ask you some simple questions first. What cars have you driven before?

**Speaker 2:**
I have driven many types of cars, from manual to automatic, including regular sedans, SUVs, MPVs, and even some pickup trucks.
There are many types of vehicles, from manual to automatic transmissions, including regular sedans, SUVs, MPVs, and even some pickup trucks. I've driven most of these types, but the vehicle I've spent the most time driving is a seven-seater SUV.

Interviewer:
Have you driven any of the new electric vehicles that have come out recently?

Interviewee:
Yes, I've driven electric cars from NIO and BAIC.

Interviewer:
I see.

Interviewee:
Yes, those are the ones I've driven.

Interviewer:
Have you recently driven any cars with advanced driver-assistance systems?

Interviewee:
Yes, I have.

Interviewer:
Such as adaptive cruise control or automatic start-stop?

Interviewee:
Yes, they have those features.

Interviewer:
Could you share which car and which feature left the most impression on you?

Interviewee:
The adaptive cruise control left a strong impression on me. Most of the cars I've driven in recent years have this feature. I use it frequently, whether I'm traveling for leisure or business across the country. I've experienced both the traditional and the newer versions of adaptive cruise control. I've also used the systems in BMW and Mercedes.

Interviewer:
How do you feel about these driver-assistance features?

Interviewee:
I think they have a dual nature. On one hand, they are very convenient, especially on long highway trips, as they allow you to relax your feet. On the other hand, they can have drawbacks, such as causing fatigue during long night drives.

Interviewer:
So, you mean they can make you less attentive because they allow you to relax too much?

Interviewee:
Yes, exactly. They can make you less focused.

Interviewer:
Besides adaptive cruise control, are there any other features that left a strong impression on you?

Interviewee:
Not really. Features like anti-skid systems, automatic parking, and hill-start assist are nice to have but not essential for me. Most of the cars I drive are automatic, so hill-start assist isn't very useful. Automatic start-stop can help with fuel consumption in city traffic, but it's not very effective when traffic is smooth. I find the automatic start-stop feature somewhat redundant.

Interviewer:
Do you usually drive short distances or long distances in the city? On average, how many kilometers or how much time do you spend driving?

Interviewee:
Mostly short distances, around 10 to 15 kilometers for commuting.

Interviewer:
10 to 15 kilometers, got it. How do you feel about driving our vehicle today? Are there any aspects that you found uncomfortable?

Interviewee:
Not much discomfort, just one thing that...
**Interviewer:** How did you feel driving our vehicle today? Were there any aspects that you found uncomfortable?

**Interviewee:** Not much discomfort, really. The only thing I noticed was that the steering wheel is quite sensitive.

**Interviewer:** A bit too sensitive, you mean? Just a slight movement and it changes direction. I see. Does this affect your driving?

**Interviewee:** Not really. But if you slightly oversteer while turning, it could be an issue.

**Interviewer:** Understood. Can you share some experiences of driving important passengers?

**Interviewee:** My main job is being an ambassador's driver, so I often transport VIPs, including the ambassador and other significant individuals.

**Interviewer:** Can you share specific experiences, like a particular instance of driving these VIPs? How does it differ from driving on your own?

**Interviewee:** Driving them requires a different approach. When driving alone, I might be more casual and aggressive. But with VIPs, I need to drive very smoothly. Even if the light is green, I slow down well in advance to avoid sudden stops.

**Interviewer:** So, even at a green light, you start slowing down early?

**Interviewee:** Yes, I take my foot off the accelerator early. It's not about deliberately waiting; it's just about ensuring a smooth ride.

**Interviewer:** Can you recall a specific instance where you had to ensure the VIPs were comfortable?

**Interviewee:** There have been times when the leader had a tight schedule, like a 3 PM flight but a meeting that ends at 2:30 PM. In such cases, I had to drive quickly yet smoothly to ensure they didn't miss the flight. We use special routes, so timing is crucial. There were instances on the highway where other drivers, seeing the diplomatic flags, would behave unpredictably.
Speaker 1:
When you were driving to the airport, did you encounter any unusual situations on the highway?

Speaker 2:
Yes, a few times on the airport highway. Some drivers can be quite aggressive. When they see a car from the embassy with a diplomatic flag, instead of giving way, they deliberately try to block you and prevent you from merging.

Speaker 1:
How did you handle those situations?

Speaker 2:
In those cases, you have to be assertive but also cautious. You need to find gaps to merge into, but you must also maintain a safe distance from the car in front.

Speaker 1:
How do you balance being assertive and maintaining safety?

Speaker 2:
You need to anticipate the distance to the car in front and be aware of the road conditions. Based on personal experience, if there are three lanes on the highway, you should be prepared to switch lanes as needed.

Speaker 1:
So, you think being adaptable is key?

Speaker 2:
Yes, adaptability is crucial. Especially in Beijing, where traffic congestion is high and the roads are complex. When you're in the middle lane, the traffic flow can be more intense.

Speaker 1:
I understand. What do you focus on when it's not an emergency situation?

Speaker 2:
In non-emergency situations, safety is the priority. 

Speaker 1:
I mean, what specific driving habits do you pay attention to?

Speaker 2:
I always anticipate and observe the road ahead for any potential issues.

Speaker 1:
Like potholes or bumps?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly.

Speaker 1:
Or any damage caused by heavy vehicles?

Speaker 2:
Yes, and I try to avoid manhole covers to prevent any jolts.

Speaker 1:
Anything else?

Speaker 2:
Not much else, just general caution.

Speaker 1:
Got it. Have you ever been in a traffic accident?

Speaker 2:
No, I haven't.

Speaker 1:
Alright, let's start by reviewing your eye-tracking video. We'll ask about your usual driving habits and see if they match what we observe in the video. We're starting now, and you can see the red dot indicating where you were looking at that moment.

Speaker 1:
Do you remember if you honked or heard any sounds?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I deliberately avoided the delivery truck at that intersection.

Speaker 1:
Understood. Now, we're entering the experimental road after leaving the parking lot. The first turn is a right turn. Can you describe your usual habits when making a turn?

Speaker 2:
When making a turn, I first observe the traffic conditions in the opposite direction.
**Speaker 1:** Can you describe your usual driving habits when making a turn?

**Speaker 2:** During the turning process, the first thing I do is observe the traffic conditions in the opposite direction.

**Speaker 1:** So, if you're making a right turn, you first look to the left, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I check the left side to see if there are any oncoming vehicles. If there are no cars coming, I then check the right side.

**Speaker 1:** You mean the side you're turning into?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, the side I'm turning into.

**Speaker 1:** Right, and what about the strategy for the opposite lane?

**Speaker 2:** If there's no median strip, I might also check the oncoming traffic in the opposite lane.

**Speaker 1:** Got it.

**Speaker 2:** After checking these two areas, I look at the rearview mirror. If there are barriers or medians on both sides, I check them as well.

**Speaker 1:** When making a right turn, which rearview mirror do you check?

**Speaker 2:** For a right turn, I check the right rearview mirror. If it's a busy intersection with more pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles, I pay extra attention.

**Speaker 1:** What do you specifically look for in such busy intersections?

**Speaker 2:** First, I check for electric bikes and motorcycles. If I see any, especially delivery bikes, I usually brake and let them pass first.

**Speaker 1:** Do you observe through the front windshield?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I observe through the front windshield and also check the rearview mirrors.

**Speaker 1:** Understood. You mentioned that your eye movements are quite high.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I tend to be very attentive.

**Speaker 1:** When do you start observing the left side?

**Speaker 2:** I start observing the left side as soon as I approach the turn, especially if there's an oncoming car that catches my attention.

**Speaker 1:** Got it. When you observe the left side, do you look through the window or the windshield?

**Speaker 2:** I look through the windshield, focusing on the area around the tree or any significant landmark.

**Speaker 1:** So, you don't check the right rearview mirror while turning?

**Speaker 2:** I do check the right rearview mirror while turning, but not before the turn. I check it to see if there are any pedestrians or vehicles coming from behind.

**Speaker 1:** Up until now, you haven't checked the rearview mirror?

**Speaker 2:** I do check it, but only briefly. If I don't see anything in the mirror, I don't focus on it.

**Speaker 1:** Understood.
Speaker 1:
So, when you glanced at the mirror and didn't see anything, you didn't pay much attention to it?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I just took a quick look. If I didn't see anything in the mirror, I wouldn't focus on it.

Speaker 1:
Got it. So, for instance, if you saw a non-motorized vehicle approaching from your right front and it seemed like it wanted to squeeze in, how would you handle that situation?

Speaker 2:
I would leave some space on my right side for it. I wouldn't make a sharp turn.

Speaker 1:
You would make a wider turn?

Speaker 2:
Yes, or I might slow down a bit to let it pass first, or give it enough space.

Speaker 1:
So, when a non-motorized vehicle is coming towards you, you usually choose to make a wider left turn?

Speaker 2:
Yes.

Speaker 1:
I noticed that you tend to hold the steering wheel at the upper part. Is that a habit?

Speaker 2:
It depends on the car model.

Speaker 1:
Based on the car model?

Speaker 2:
Yes, it depends on the shape of the steering wheel and where the grip points are. For example, in this car, if you hold it lower, it's too far down. This car has a three-spoke steering wheel, so you either hold it at the bottom or in the middle, depending on the design.

Speaker 1:
Understood. Now, let's talk about merging from a side road to a main road. Can you describe your usual driving habit in this scenario?

Speaker 2:
My habit is to first observe the situation at the entrance, then check the left rear side for any oncoming cars. If there are no cars, I merge quickly.

Speaker 1:
When you say "merge quickly," do you mean turning quickly or accelerating quickly?

Speaker 2:
Turning quickly.

Speaker 1:
So, you turn quickly to merge?

Speaker 2:
Yes, because some drivers might merge slowly if they don't see any cars coming from behind.

Speaker 1:
When a pedestrian was crossing the road in front of you, how did you handle it?

Speaker 2:
I lightly tapped the brake to slow down a bit.

Speaker 1:
How did you decide that you could proceed safely?

Speaker 2:
I judged based on my speed and the pedestrian's walking speed.

Speaker 1:
When you first looked at the left rearview mirror, you couldn't see any cars because they were blocked by the bushes, right? How did you decide to check the rear situation?

Speaker 2:
I would adjust my position to get a clearer view of the rear.
**Interviewer:** At that moment, you probably couldn't see the vehicles behind you because they were blocked by the bushes. How did you decide to check the traffic behind you?

**Driver:** From that angle, it might seem like the bushes block the view, but from the previous position, I could already see the vehicles behind.

**Interviewer:** So, you could see the vehicles behind. You judged that there were no cars and immediately turned in. This was a stretch of road with good conditions, just straight driving. Can you describe your usual driving habits during steady-speed, straight-line driving?

**Driver:** If there's a countdown traffic light ahead and there's enough time, I accelerate and go through. If I can't see or if there are cars queued up waiting for the light, I adjust accordingly.

**Interviewer:** What kind of speed do you usually maintain? You can discuss different road conditions or speed limits.

**Driver:** If there's no speed limit, on city roads, I usually maintain around 10 km/h.

**Interviewer:** What kind of distance do you keep from the car in front?

**Driver:** It depends on the time of day. During rush hours, I make sure not to let other cars cut in.

**Interviewer:** What kind of distance are we talking about?

**Driver:** About three-quarters of the distance between two cars.

**Interviewer:** So, 30 to 40 centimeters, not more than half a meter. And during regular times?

**Driver:** During regular times, I keep a distance of about two to three meters.

**Interviewer:** Did you perform any overtaking maneuvers during the actual test? If not, just tell me about your usual habits since we can't compare specific instances.

**Driver:** I don't quite remember. But generally, I can describe my usual overtaking habits.

**Interviewer:** Sure, go ahead.

**Driver:** When overtaking, if I'm driving alone, I might accelerate quickly and overtake in a few seconds, reaching a speed increase of 20-30 km/h. But if I'm driving VIP passengers, I ensure a smooth and gradual acceleration to avoid any discomfort.

**Interviewer:** Can you describe the gradual acceleration in more detail?

**Driver:** For example, if I'm driving alone, I might floor the pedal and quickly overtake. But with VIP passengers, I ensure a steady and smooth acceleration to maintain comfort, without causing a sudden push-back sensation.
**Speaker 1:**
How do you determine the appropriate speed for overtaking another vehicle?

**Speaker 2:**
It's a matter of driving intuition. You gauge the distance between your car and the vehicle in front of you, as well as your current speed and the speed of the vehicle you intend to overtake.

**Speaker 1:**
So, there's no fixed rule for this?

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly, there's no strict rule. It's more about the situation and your judgment. 

**Speaker 1:**
Can you describe your observation habits when overtaking?

**Speaker 2:**
First, I observe the direction in which I plan to overtake, specifically my left front. I check if the distance is sufficient for overtaking.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you check the distance between your car and the vehicle in front of you on the left?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, including the distance to the next intersection or any obstacles ahead. Based on this, I decide whether to overtake or not.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you observe anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I also check if the vehicle I intend to overtake has any intention of overtaking the vehicle in front of it. If both of us try to change lanes at the same time, it could be dangerous.

**Speaker 1:**
What if the vehicle you are overtaking also tries to overtake another vehicle at the same time?

**Speaker 2:**
If that happens, I could get stuck. To avoid this, I look at the driving habits of the vehicle in front of me, especially on highways. For example, if it's a truck and it's empty, it might try to overtake a slower, loaded truck in front of it. In such cases, I might signal my intention to overtake.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you signal your intention?

**Speaker 2:**
I use my headlights or horn, or keep my left turn signal on. This is especially useful when overtaking a long line of vehicles. It's an unwritten rule, not necessarily in the traffic regulations.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it's more of a customary practice?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it's a customary practice. Keeping the left turn signal on lets the vehicles ahead know that you are overtaking. Once you finish overtaking, you turn it off. This is common in city driving as well.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, I'll continue with this video clip. Up ahead, there's a U-turn. Can you describe what you do after making the U-turn?
Speaker 1:
Alright, I'll continue playing this video clip. There's a U-turn ahead. Could you describe your usual driving habits when making a U-turn?

Speaker 2:
First, I determine whether the intersection requires observing traffic signals for a U-turn. Some places have a dedicated U-turn signal or a left-turn signal.

Speaker 1:
There are specific U-turn signals or left-turn signals.

Speaker 2:
If the left-turn signal is on, U-turns are not allowed. So, I first confirm this. Then, I deliberately move the car slightly to the right because there's usually a median strip when making a U-turn. I steer sharply to the left in one go, without needing to make multiple adjustments, provided the conditions on the right side allow it.

Speaker 1:
Did you do the same thing today? Yes, okay. Besides that...

Speaker 2:
Besides that, I also observe...

Speaker 1:
Yes?

Speaker 2:
I observe if there are any potential hazards because any traffic accident during a U-turn would be my responsibility. So, what specific areas do you pay extra attention to?

Speaker 2:
If it's a green light, I first observe the oncoming traffic.

Speaker 1:
Because if it's green for me, it's green for the oncoming traffic as well.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I observe that. Secondly, if it's a mixed lane for vehicles and pedestrians, I also check for pedestrians as I make the U-turn.

Speaker 1:
At this point, are you saying you move the car slightly to the right?

Speaker 1:
So, during the actual experiment, did you make the U-turn in one go? Yes, got it. How do you judge the distance between the front of your car and the curb when making a U-turn? Did the radar beep during the actual experiment? No, it didn't. I remember during the test drive, the left-side radar beeped when you made a left U-turn, and the front radar also beeped. But during the actual experiment, because you moved the car slightly to the right, you controlled the distance well, and there were no beeps.

Speaker 1:
Now, there's a straight-line acceleration after the U-turn. Could you describe your usual driving habits for straight-line acceleration?

Speaker 2:
This is similar to overtaking. In this case, it's like overtaking because the bus lane is occupied by two buses. The car ahead is hesitating, unsure whether to overtake or wait.

Speaker 1:
So, you decided to accelerate and pass.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I decided to accelerate and pass.

Speaker 1:
How do you usually control the throttle during acceleration? I heard you mention earlier about having VIP clients in the car.
**Interviewer:** When you accelerate, how do you usually control the throttle? I heard you mention earlier that having VIP customers in the car significantly affects how you handle the throttle.

**Driver:** Yes, my approach is to ensure a smooth acceleration that is comfortable for everyone. I aim for a gradual increase in speed, even if it takes a bit longer. Each car has different engine capacities, so I adjust accordingly.

**Interviewer:** I have a follow-up question. When you made that U-turn earlier, can you recall when you started to accelerate again?

**Driver:** I started to accelerate after noticing the car in front of me braking and a bus stopping. My left rear car hadn't completed its turn yet, so I waited until I could accelerate in a straight line.

**Interviewer:** Can we play back the footage? If you remember, please indicate when you started pressing the throttle.

**Driver:** Sure, let's pause here. At this point, I checked the rear car, which was still turning. It needed two maneuvers to complete the turn.

**Interviewer:** At this moment, there was a bus and another car in front of you, correct?

**Driver:** Yes, I made sure there were no cars on my side before proceeding. My next step was to observe the road ahead and follow my usual driving habits.

**Interviewer:** Let's continue. When did you start accelerating?

**Driver:** I began accelerating when I saw the car in front of me stop. I checked again to ensure there were no obstacles.

**Interviewer:** Do you remember how much throttle you applied initially? Let's say on a scale of 0 to 100.

**Driver:** I applied about 30%.

**Interviewer:** 30%?

**Driver:** Yes, typically, I start with 30% and gradually increase to around 60-70%. This range allows for a smooth transition.

**Interviewer:** When you have VIP passengers, do you still apply 30% throttle?

**Driver:** It depends on the car's throttle sensitivity. Around 20-30% usually ensures a smooth ride without sudden jolts. Some cars have very responsive throttles.

**Interviewer:** How do you check for traffic when changing lanes to the right?

**Driver:** I usually glance to the right.

**Interviewer:** I noticed you didn't check the right side mirror. Did you use the turn signal?

**Driver:** The bus was blocking the view, so I only needed a quick glance to the right without focusing on the mirror.

**Interviewer:** Understood.
Speaker 2:
I treat everything as if it exists.

Speaker 1:
So, in that state, you just need to glance to the right, just a quick sweep, without focusing too much on the rearview mirror. Okay.

Speaker 2:
Oh, the next turn is a right turn, right? And this right turn is essentially merging onto a main road. Do you remember your driving habits at that time or generally?

Speaker 1:
Yes, I first check my right side to observe the situation on the auxiliary road. I look for motorcycles, cars, or electric bikes that might be moving at a similar speed to mine. I assess the situation.

Speaker 2:
Can I ask if at this point you were already looking at the right rearview mirror? You should be looking at the right mirror at this time, correct?

Speaker 1:
Yes, the right rearview mirror. Exactly.

Speaker 2:
Can I ask, what is the purpose of looking at the right rearview mirror at this time? Because you can't see the auxiliary road situation from there.

Speaker 1:
You need to anticipate in advance. If you wait until you reach the intersection to look, it might be too late.

Speaker 2:
Yes, if I see vehicles moving forward on the auxiliary road, whether they are motorcycles or other vehicles, I need to be aware.

Speaker 1:
So, it's your habit to look to the right. But later you realized that you couldn't see the road from there.

Speaker 2:
You can see it.

Speaker 1:
From here?

Speaker 2:
Yes, you can see the auxiliary road situation from here.

Speaker 1:
Can you see if there are any vehicles?

Speaker 2:
Yes, you can see if there are any vehicles, including motorcycles and electric bikes.

Speaker 1:
I see. So, after you made the turn, you didn't look at the rearview mirror again because you had already determined that there were no vehicles coming from the right. Is that correct? 

Speaker 2:
Yes, that's correct.

Speaker 1:
Can you recall when you started to accelerate after making the right turn? If you remember.

Speaker 2:
Are you asking about when I started to accelerate?

Speaker 1:
Yes, when did you start to accelerate after the turn? When did you step on the gas?

Speaker 2:
After the bicycle passed. 

Speaker 1:
After the bicycle crossed the zebra crossing and the road ahead was clear?

Speaker 2:
Yes, when the road ahead was clear.

Speaker 1:
Okay, and when did you start braking for the turn?

Speaker 2:
I started braking when I saw there were no vehicles. I can't remember exactly if I was braking or just not accelerating.

Speaker 1:
At that time, you...
**Speaker 2:**
When it comes to braking, I usually observe if there are no cars around. I can't quite remember if I was braking or just not accelerating.

**Speaker 1:**
At that moment, you were not accelerating.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I think I wasn't.

**Speaker 1:**
You could see the speed decreasing at that time. Yes, you could see from the dashboard that the speed was dropping. When you exited the curve, you started to accelerate, but then you stopped and called out to stop. Is that correct?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, there was a honk at that moment.

**Speaker 1:**
The honk was to alert someone, right? What do you call it? A "senior's joyride"? Because at that moment...

**Speaker 2:**
I wasn't sure if he was going to drive on the main road or...

**Speaker 1:**
...move onto the non-motorized lane. These two lanes were merging, right? Let me clarify, what was the purpose of the honk?

**Speaker 2:**
To remind him to stop if he was coming this way.

**Speaker 1:**
I see. He was still a bit away from the next turn. Let me ask you some other questions to ensure the safety of this drive. What other areas did you particularly focus on during your driving?

**Speaker 2:**
I was mostly focused on the pedestrians on both sides.

**Speaker 1:**
More on the non-motorized vehicles and pedestrians on both sides, right? Why is that?

**Speaker 2:**
Given the current road conditions, motor vehicles tend to drive faster, and since it's not rush hour, pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles also move quickly. With more driving experience, you realize that during these times, everyone is trying to move efficiently. In heavy traffic, even if you get rear-ended, it's just a minor issue. But if you make a turn and an electric bike suddenly crosses your path, it could lead to a collision. Ironically, during peak hours, it's safer.

**Speaker 1:**
Besides pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles, what else do you pay attention to?

**Speaker 2:**
When turning or stopping, I also consider the comfort and safety of the passengers.

**Speaker 1:**
To ensure safety, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, to ensure safety. I also pay special attention to the speed. My personal driving speed might be 10-20 km/h faster than the current speed.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it. How do you think driving can be made safer?

**Speaker 2:**
By being vigilant and attentive, not getting distracted, especially on blind curves or mountain roads where you can't see oncoming traffic. It's important to honk when necessary, use low beams at night, and follow these seemingly trivial steps. Over time, they become good driving habits. Even when the light is green, always be cautious at intersections. When starting at a red light, if there's a large vehicle on your left, let it move forward a bit first before you proceed.
Speaker 1:
At intersections, you need to be cautious. When starting at a traffic light, if there's a large vehicle to your left, let it move forward a bit before you proceed.

Speaker 2:
Got it. Understood. Now, we've reached another intersection. Can you explain how you handled it at that time?

Speaker 1:
I remember yielding to pedestrians first.

Speaker 2:
Were you looking at any data at that moment?

Speaker 1:
No, I was checking the pedestrian crossing. You rarely check the right-side mirror when making a right turn.

Speaker 2:
As long as I'm sure there's nothing coming quickly from my right side, I don't feel the need to check deliberately.

Speaker 1:
Why didn't you observe the vehicles on your left when making this right turn?

Speaker 2:
The left side had a red light. Even if a vehicle tried to run the red light, the oncoming traffic would have to slow down or stop because their speed was already up. So, the left side was safe.

Speaker 1:
Are you referring to the taxi? You judged that it was moving fast enough to pass through, meaning there was no immediate danger from the left. Even if a car came, it would first have to deal with the taxi. Understood. Can you recall any driving situations that particularly scared you?

Speaker 2:
Driving when tired, especially after lunch. That time of day makes me very drowsy. There have been instances where I felt very sleepy while driving.

Speaker 1:
Did you fall asleep?

Speaker 2:
Not exactly asleep, but I couldn't focus.

Speaker 1:
And that scared you because you suddenly realized you weren't fully aware?

Speaker 2:
Yes, and I noticed the car had drifted out of its lane.

Speaker 1:
Besides fatigue, are there any road or traffic conditions that scare you?

Speaker 2:
Especially in urban areas, driving at 70 mph at night, when something suddenly jumps out from an unlit area. The reaction time is very limited, and it can be quite frightening if you don't brake quickly.

Speaker 1:
Besides electric vehicles, is there anything else? Did you notice a school zone ahead?

Speaker 2:
No, I didn't notice.

Speaker 1:
Alright, because you see, this...
Speaker 1: Can I ask if you noticed a school ahead when you were driving?

Speaker 2: I didn't notice it.

Speaker 1: Okay, because there is a sign indicating a school zone on the dashboard. Do you usually not pay attention to such signs? What do you think are some of your bad driving habits that could lead to dangerous situations?

Speaker 2: Well, I tend to drive aggressively. I don't yield to anyone unless it's an emergency vehicle like a police car. For anyone else, I won't let them in, even if it means risking a collision. I guess you could say I have a bit of road rage.

Speaker 1: Besides that, do you have any other bad driving habits?

Speaker 2: Maybe driving long distances alone, which can lead to fatigue. I sometimes overestimate my alertness.

Speaker 1: When you're a passenger, what driving behaviors make you feel nervous or uneasy?

Speaker 2: Everyone has different driving habits. For example, on this lane in the video, some people tend to drive closer to the left, while others stay to the right. Those who drive too close to the right make me nervous because they are near the curb.

Speaker 1: What about those who drive too close to the left? Does that make you nervous?

Speaker 2: Not really. A car hitting another car is not a big deal; we all have insurance. But hitting a pedestrian is a huge problem. In traffic, I always prioritize pedestrians over vehicles. Even if I have to swerve to avoid a pedestrian and end up hitting another car, I would do it. Also, new drivers make me nervous.

Speaker 1: New drivers?

Speaker 2: Yes, like when I was helping a friend practice driving. We were on a city road, not a highway. It was near a bridge leading to the fourth ring road. The road wasn't very wide, and my friend tried to switch from the far right lane to make a left turn, crossing five lanes. Luckily, it wasn't rush hour, but the cars behind us honked, and it scared me a lot.

Speaker 1: I understand. Let's continue with the video. This is a left turn, the first left turn in the entire test route. Can you describe your habit when making a left turn?

Speaker 2: I usually check the right side first, then the left, and then proceed.

Speaker 1: Do you find left turns or right turns more challenging? Which one do you think requires more attention?

Speaker 2: Right turns require more attention because there are often pedestrians and vehicles coming from the right.
**Speaker 1:**
Could you please pay more attention to turning right? Turning right is more important. Why is that?

**Speaker 2:**
Because on my right side, there are indicators and vehicles moving straight.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you think that when turning left, you won't be affected by non-motorized vehicles moving straight?

**Speaker 2:**
When turning left, I have a wider field of vision.

**Speaker 1:**
So, at that moment, you were already observing the situation on the right side.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I was observing the entrance situation.

**Speaker 1:**
At that moment, you started by observing the right side of the road, then the left side. If there were no issues, you would proceed to turn.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you usually pay attention to the passenger's experience when driving? Besides VIP clients, do you also consider the experience of other passengers?

**Speaker 2:**
As long as there are people in my car, I do.

**Speaker 1:**
What aspects of the passenger experience do you pay attention to?

**Speaker 2:**
Mainly acceleration and overtaking.

**Speaker 1:**
Acceleration and overtaking?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, especially sudden acceleration.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you consciously pay attention to these aspects? You mentioned that you keep the throttle between 30% and 60% and gradually accelerate.

**Speaker 2:**
For passengers who are not very familiar, I usually maintain this range to avoid making the ride uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
Besides the throttle, you mentioned overtaking. Do you try to minimize overtaking, or how do you handle it?

**Speaker 2:**
I overtake smoothly when possible and avoid overtaking if it's not necessary.

**Speaker 1:**
Apart from the throttle and overtaking, do you pay attention to any other aspects?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I also keep the volume low.

**Speaker 1:**
In terms of driving, do you think you have any bad habits that might make passengers uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
If the passenger is not a VIP or a close friend, I tend to keep a very short distance from the car in front during traffic jams, which leads to frequent braking. This can make passengers uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you think that maintaining a close distance and frequent braking can make passengers uncomfortable. Do you have any bad habits when driving VIP clients?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I maintain a safe distance and avoid frequent braking unless they request to hurry due to time constraints.
Speaker 1: How often do you drive?

Speaker 2: Quite frequently. Unless he specifically requests it, like if he's in a hurry. My boss is different from those ambassadors from big countries. He likes to take advantage of situations. If you cut in line or prevent someone else from cutting in, he'll praise you for being assertive. But when picking up other leaders, it's different.

Speaker 1: Do you experience that push-back feeling when driving?

Speaker 2: Only if the event is really urgent and he's running late. If he's late and blames you, then I just focus on getting him there on time. If there's traffic and you have to stop and go, it can be jerky. In non-urgent situations, I drive more smoothly. In urgent situations, I drive more aggressively, like accelerating quickly when needed.

Speaker 1: I understand. When driving VIPs, you avoid frequent acceleration and braking, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, but this only happens during rush hours. 

Speaker 1: So, it's easier to get stuck in traffic with important clients?

Speaker 2: Even if you speed up, you won't get far because of the traffic. 

Speaker 1: Just a few meters.

Speaker 2: Exactly. A tip is to watch the brake lights of the car in front of the one directly ahead of you. If those lights go off, it means the traffic is moving, and you should be ready to follow. Don't wait for the car directly in front of you to move.

Speaker 1: You mean looking through the windows of the car in front to see the brake lights of the car ahead?

Speaker 2: Yes, you can see it, especially at night. Every car has high-mounted brake lights. If it's an SUV, you can see it over the roof of a sedan.

Speaker 1: And if both are sedans?

Speaker 2: You can still see through the rear and front windows of the car in front. 

Speaker 1: That's a useful tip.

Speaker 2: Yes, it helps to anticipate traffic movement. 

Speaker 1: Can you show me an example? Let's continue with the scenario.

Speaker 1: For instance, if a non-motorized vehicle blocks your lane and you have to drive in the opposite lane, how do you handle it?

Speaker 2: If there are no cars, I just go around.

Speaker 1: And if there are cars?

Speaker 2: If there are cars, I wait for a safe gap before going around.
Interviewer: How do you usually handle a situation where a vehicle is driving in the wrong lane?

Driver: If there are no other cars, I just go past it.

Interviewer: What if there is another car coming towards you? It gets complicated.

Driver: In that case, whoever has the right of way should be allowed to go first.

Interviewer: What about bicycles? Especially if the cyclist is looking around and not paying attention?

Driver: I consider my speed and the cyclist's speed. Even if the cyclist makes a sudden left turn, I can avoid a collision.

Interviewer: You just glanced at something. What was it?

Driver: Was it a pedestrian?

Interviewer: No, I meant the right rearview mirror.

Driver: Oh, I was checking the left front because there was a pedestrian there.

Interviewer: So, you glanced to the right to check the rearview mirror?

Driver: Yes, just a quick look.

Interviewer: Was the cyclist trying to pass between you and the white car on the right?

Driver: No, I was overtaking the cyclist and needed to ensure I left enough space.

Interviewer: When you made that left turn, did you check the right side?

Interviewer: I noticed you only looked to the left and not the right.

Driver: I usually check the entrance again. If I can see there are no cars in my field of vision, I proceed. It's a habit; I don't mechanically check every intersection. If I see no cars, I just go.

Interviewer: Why did you check the right rearview mirror at that moment?

Driver: To see if there were any fast-approaching vehicles.

Interviewer: From where?

Driver: From the right rear or directly from the right.

Interviewer: So, you were concerned about vehicles coming from the right?

Driver: Yes, especially motorcycles that tend to speed up quickly. Cars are easier to spot and react to.

Interviewer: What driving habits of others make you uncomfortable when you're a passenger?

Driver: When the driver is too heavy-handed or too slow, not giving enough gas when needed. It’s different from my driving style. If you don't drive, you might not notice, but once you do, you become more aware of these habits.
When driving with a driver whose driving habits are different from your own, it can be quite uncomfortable, especially if their skills are not as good as yours.

Speaker 1:
How do you judge a driver's skill?

Speaker 2:
You can tell by how they handle situations like overtaking, merging lanes, or entering traffic. If they hesitate and take too long, even when other cars are giving them space, it can be frustrating. You start to wonder if they really know how to drive.

Speaker 1:
Can you be more specific? Besides slow merging or lane changing, what other bad driving habits make you uncomfortable?

Speaker 2:
For example, when turning, you should signal first before making the turn. Some drivers signal too late, only when they are already turning. This can be very annoying.

Speaker 1:
Anything else?

Speaker 2:
Some drivers accelerate too aggressively.

Speaker 1:
Okay, so we had two other passengers in the car during the experiment. They had a handle to indicate their reactions. Would you like to see where they pressed the handle during the drive?

Speaker 2:
Sure, let's watch the video and see their reactions.

Speaker 1:
In this experiment, we emphasized treating the passengers as important guests. Considering their comfort, did you pay extra attention to any specific aspects?

Speaker 2:
Yes, mainly the points I mentioned earlier, like smooth starts and reducing sudden movements.

Speaker 1:
How do you avoid jerking the car when turning?

Speaker 2:
You need to maintain a steady angle with the steering wheel. Keep it fixed at a certain angle to ensure a smooth turn.

Speaker 1:
So, you keep the steering wheel at a fixed angle?

Speaker 2:
Yes, when making a turn, I keep the steering wheel steady. Some drivers keep adjusting the wheel, which causes the car to sway.

Speaker 1:
So, once you set the angle, you don't change it?

Speaker 2:
Exactly. For example, when entering a parking garage, I can judge the turning radius immediately and keep the wheel steady.
Speaker 2:
Under the Han Bridge, there are some underground garages. In this situation, I can manage to enter smoothly.

Speaker 1:
Yes, as soon as you enter, you need to immediately judge the curvature of the turn. If you maintain a fixed angle, you won't need to adjust constantly. However, sometimes you might need to make continuous adjustments, which can make passengers feel uncomfortable. A fixed turning angle is generally more comfortable. Besides that...

Speaker 2:
Besides that, when you're in the middle of a turn, you need to maintain a steady speed by gently accelerating.

Speaker 1:
How should you accelerate in the middle of a turn?

Speaker 2:
When exiting the turn, you need to apply a bit of throttle.

Speaker 1:
Just like I asked earlier, when do you apply the throttle during multiple turns?

Speaker 2:
Yes, in all turns, you should accelerate at the apex of the turn.

Speaker 1:
You need to accelerate at that moment.

Speaker 2:
When entering a turn, you can lightly brake or not brake at all. But when exiting, you should accelerate at the apex.

Speaker 1:
Why do you need to accelerate at the apex?

Speaker 2:
To ensure a smooth and consistent speed throughout the turn. If you don't accelerate at the apex, the speed will drop, and accelerating after the turn will cause a sudden jolt.

Speaker 1:
I understand. It would create a noticeable push-back effect. Besides turning, what other aspects do you pay attention to?

Speaker 2:
I try to avoid visible manhole covers to prevent bumps.

Speaker 1:
To avoid bumps, right. What about steering wheel control? Any tips on returning the steering wheel?

Speaker 2:
When returning the steering wheel, just let it go back naturally. Don't force it. The car should return to its original angle on its own.

Speaker 1:
Which is faster, the speed of the car or the speed of the steering wheel returning?

Speaker 2:
When you maintain a steady speed, the wheels will naturally return to their position without you having to force it. The steering wheel will align itself.

Speaker 1:
Got it. Let's continue. Besides turning, what else do you focus on to ensure passenger comfort?

Speaker 2:
I avoid potholes and uneven surfaces to make the ride smoother.

Speaker 1:
What about speed bumps?

Speaker 2:
It's better to go over speed bumps from the middle to make the ride smoother.

Speaker 1:
I understand. Avoid having both wheels hit the speed bump simultaneously. Anything else?

Speaker 2:
No, that's about it.

Speaker 1:
How do you think you can make passengers feel more comfortable?

Speaker 2:
Frequent checks. If you want to make passengers feel even more comfortable, what else can you improve?
**Speaker 1:**
How can you make the ride more comfortable for passengers? Are there areas where you think you can improve or make more effort?

**Speaker 2:**
At the moment, I can't think of anything specific. I usually listen to passenger feedback.

**Speaker 1:**
Passengers usually only press the button when they feel uncomfortable.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, they don't usually give feedback unless there's an issue.

**Speaker 1:**
Why is that? Is it because it's hard to get real-time feedback?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it's difficult to get real-time feedback because they are also focused on their own activities. For example, if there's a bicycle with a child on it, how do you handle that situation, especially on a road without a clearly marked bike lane?

**Speaker 1:**
I make sure to keep a safe distance from the bicycle. I don't move towards their side.

**Speaker 2:**
So, you start steering to the left early on to avoid them?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, I slightly steer to the left to avoid them. If I see the cyclist swerving, I slow down.

**Speaker 2:**
I wouldn't drive parallel to them. This intersection is crucial in our experiment because it's an unmarked four-way stop. Can you describe your actions when you approach this intersection, especially when making a right turn followed by a left turn?

**Speaker 1:**
First, I ensure my visual range is clear of any potential hazards. If there are no immediate risks, I yield to pedestrians. If a pedestrian is at the crosswalk, I let them go first. If they are not using the crosswalk, I proceed ahead of them.

**Speaker 2:**
So, the pedestrian was standing in front of the crosswalk but didn't move. You initially checked left and then right before turning. How do you determine if the pedestrian will stay or move forward?

**Speaker 1:**
I observe their behavior. A pedestrian usually won't suddenly dash across the road from a standstill. If they are continuously walking, I yield to them. If they are standing still, I proceed cautiously.

**Speaker 2:**
What if the pedestrian is slightly turned away and not looking at you? Do you worry they might suddenly step forward?

**Speaker 1:**
I maintain a distance that accounts for any sudden movements they might make.
Speaker 1: Do you worry that he might suddenly take a step or two forward at this moment?

Speaker 2: No, because when I make the turn, I keep a distance of more than a few steps from him.

Speaker 1: How do you judge if he intends to stop?

Speaker 2: I observe his movements. If he was walking and then starts to slow down or stop, I can tell he intends to stop.

Speaker 1: At this moment, he seems to be moving forward a bit and looking around. When you get closer, he stops. How do you judge if he might take another step or two forward?

Speaker 2: First, I ensure that my turning distance and speed are such that even if he steps forward, I won't hit him. That's the first point.

Speaker 1: So you maintain a distance that allows for his potential forward movement.

Speaker 2: Yes, and secondly, my speed is controlled so that if he does step forward, I can stop immediately. It's about managing both speed and distance.

Speaker 1: So you control everything well, ensuring that even if he moves forward, you can stop in time. At this moment, you judge that he won't move further because he has already stopped.

Speaker 2: Yes, and I also make a wider turn to completely avoid any risk.

Speaker 1: I noticed you glanced at the rearview mirror.

Speaker 2: Yes, just to ensure everything is clear behind me.

Speaker 1: Just to make sure. How do you judge if you can make a right turn when the lane is occupied?

Speaker 2: In such situations, I first check the navigation for any lane or camera warnings. If there are none and the distance is clear, I proceed.

Speaker 1: And when approaching a right turn, how do you observe the situation?

Speaker 2: Before reaching the intersection, if the light is red, I check my left side first.

Speaker 1: The left side, for oncoming traffic.

Speaker 2: Yes, if the left side is clear, I then focus more on the right side. If the light turns green, I first check the right side and then proceed.

Speaker 1: So when the light turns green, you slow down and observe both the right side and any non-motorized vehicles moving forward. However, non-motorized vehicles often don't follow traffic lights, especially at smaller intersections.
Speaker 1: When you were driving straight ahead, you encountered non-motorized vehicles. They often don't pay much attention to cars. At traffic lights, it's usually fine on main roads and major intersections, but at smaller intersections, they don't look at all. So, when you were making a right turn, you didn't follow the traditional approach of looking left first and then right because you knew the left side had a red light.

Speaker 2: Yes, exactly. So, it was clear on the left side.

Speaker 1: You were yielding to pedestrians, right? Even if the pedestrian was far away, you would wait until they completely crossed before accelerating or stepping on the gas to pass the intersection. Can I ask if you usually stay in the middle lane after making a right turn instead of the rightmost lane?

Speaker 2: It depends. Since I was letting the pedestrian go first, I had to make a wider turn, which put me in the middle lane.

Speaker 1: So, there was a pedestrian crossing the road at that time. How did you handle that situation?

Speaker 2: It was quite dark, so I slowed down in advance. I was worried because you never know what a pedestrian might do.

Speaker 1: You were afraid they might stop suddenly when they saw the car coming?

Speaker 2: Yes, sometimes pedestrians freeze when they see a car. If you try to rush past them, they might stop suddenly, thinking they should let you go first. It's important to anticipate their actions.

Speaker 1: How do you handle a situation where both the pedestrian and the car are trying to yield to each other at an intersection?

Speaker 2: I would slow down in advance. When I see a pedestrian on the road, I won't accelerate. I won't try to rush past them or swerve around them. I'll observe which direction they are going.

Speaker 1: How do you observe which direction they are going?

Speaker 2: By slowing down the car. When they see you slowing down, they will make a decision. I give them enough time to decide.

Speaker 1: If they stop, you go around them?

Speaker 2: Yes, if they stop completely, I will go around them.

Speaker 1: How do you determine if they have completely stopped?

Speaker 2: When a person is walking and suddenly stops, it's usually a reaction to something. If they see a large truck coming, they will either run or stop. It's a natural instinct; they won't have a third option unless they are being reckless.
**Speaker 1:**
There are two possible reactions: either run or freeze.

**Speaker 2:**
That's human instinct. There are only two options; a third one is impossible unless someone has a death wish. Running towards you would be suicidal.

**Speaker 1:**
I'll ask you more about this later. Let's continue watching this video. Oh, here we need to make a right turn. At this point, you should check the rearview mirror. Also, I have some other questions for you. What do you think makes a good or professional driver?

**Speaker 2:**
A good driver can anticipate complex road conditions in advance.

**Speaker 1:**
So, being able to anticipate complex road conditions is a skill that good or professional drivers possess. What do you mean by complex road conditions?

**Speaker 2:**
Crowded areas with lots of people and vehicles, where unexpected situations frequently occur. You need to have a sense of safety, a certain level of respect for safe driving, and the ability to predict and prepare in advance. It's not about reacting to situations as they happen but about preventing them.

**Speaker 1:**
How can one develop such predictive abilities?

**Speaker 2:**
Slow down at intersections, don't compete with large vehicles, and be mindful of other drivers' visibility when changing lanes.

**Speaker 1:**
So, through good driving habits...

**Speaker 2:**
It's not just about habits. Driving isn't something you can teach easily.

**Speaker 1:**
You can't teach it, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly. I believe there's no such thing as a so-called professional driver. In my opinion, only those who have undergone special driving training in the military can be considered professional.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you mean by special driving training?

**Speaker 2:**
I had a friend who was a special police officer. He could drive a wide GL8 vehicle through a narrow underground parking lot at 60 km/h. He could flip any vehicle, larger or smaller, if he wanted to. That's what I call professional driving.

**Speaker 2:**
Special driving training teaches you how to avoid danger in various situations and, if unavoidable, how to flip the target vehicle. What we do is more like being professional drivers. We have extensive driving experience, often covering hundreds of thousands of kilometers. For example, I've driven on all the major highways across China. I have a better sense of the road and can judge the angle needed to navigate a turn just by looking at it.

**Speaker 2:**
Even if you score perfectly on all your driving tests, you still...
Speaker 1:
I have a sense of how much to turn the wheel in those situations.

Speaker 2:
So, you say you aced all your driving school exams and have driven a few thousand kilometers. Does that make you a good driver or not? When faced with emergencies, you might not know how to handle them. For example, if you're driving at 120 km/h on the highway and you get a flat tire, how do you control the car? If you only rely on textbook knowledge, you won't know if the methods work in real-life situations. Imagine driving at 120 km/h and hitting a puddle; the water resistance can suddenly pull your car to one side and slow you down. These are the kinds of experiences you might lack.

Speaker 1:
Besides what you just mentioned, what else do you think makes a good driver or a professional driver?

Speaker 2:
The main thing is to anticipate safety. You need to foresee potential situations, like a dog running into the road or a non-motorized vehicle crossing your path. When I drive, I often glance around, even if it's not an intersection, because you never know if someone might come from the opposite direction. If there's a car ahead trying to merge, you need to decide whether to let them in or not. These are things you must constantly think about while driving, not just focus on the act of driving itself.

Speaker 1:
Is there anything else?

Speaker 2:
If you can do that, you're already quite professional.

Speaker 1:
What do you think is the biggest difference between experienced and novice drivers?

Speaker 2:
There's a saying that experienced drivers control the car with the accelerator, while novice drivers rely on the brake. For example, if I'm driving at 120 km/h and the speed limit ahead drops to 100 km/h, a novice driver might brake hard to reduce speed. An experienced driver like me would...

Speaker 1:
I understand, but can you explain the difference in their approaches more specifically?

Speaker 2:
Sure. If I'm driving at 120 km/h and see the speed limit drop to 100 km/h, I would ease off the accelerator and let the car coast to the new speed limit. The same goes for approaching traffic lights; I start slowing down well in advance rather than braking hard at the last moment.

Speaker 1:
I see. Anything else?

Speaker 2:
Another difference is in handling turns. You often see drivers misjudge turns, scraping the curb with the rear wheels or hitting barriers with the front bumper. This comes down to having a good feel for the car's dimensions and the performance of the brakes and accelerator.

Speaker 1:
Let's go back to the topic of using the accelerator...
Speaker 1:
So, let's go back to the topic of using the accelerator and brake to control the vehicle. Why do you think there are differences in how people handle this?

Speaker 2:
The main reason for these differences is that many people, like me today, are test-driving a car for the first time. They intentionally try to feel the car's acceleration and braking. After a while, you get a sense of when to brake and how much pressure to apply. This also includes understanding the car's dimensions. Especially with rental cars, you don't just hit the road immediately. You need to figure out how deep to press the brake pedal; otherwise, you might not stop in time or you might brake too hard.

Speaker 1:
So, the reason for these differences is that they are not familiar with the vehicle, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, they are not familiar with the vehicle and also with the new road conditions.

Speaker 1:
This unfamiliarity leads them to rely more on the brake to control the vehicle. Once they get used to it, they realize they don't need to brake as frequently. They can control the speed better using the accelerator or even just the car's natural friction.

Speaker 2:
These two driving styles result in very different passenger experiences.

Speaker 1:
Here's a slightly more challenging question. In what ways do you think autonomous vehicles will never be able to match human drivers?

Speaker 2:
First, there's the ratio of speed to distance. When my speed is too high, the reaction distance needs to be longer.

Speaker 1:
What do you mean?

Speaker 2:
In normal conditions, an autonomous vehicle might lack the ability to anticipate. All its perceptions come from radar sensors or cameras, which require a certain distance to react. For example, if it's traveling at 90 km/h, its safe braking distance might be 50 or even 60 meters. If there's an intersection 30 meters ahead and something suddenly appears, the car might not be able to stop in time, leading to an accident.

Speaker 1:
So, it can't stop in time. What do you think an autonomous vehicle would do in that situation?

Speaker 2:
It would definitely try to brake, but if it can't stop in time, an accident is inevitable. A human driver, on the other hand, might see the intersection ahead and start slowing down in advance. If autonomous driving systems were to slow down at every intersection, traffic would be severely congested. Unless every vehicle on the road is autonomous and there's no human interference, and pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles are completely separated, I don't think machines will ever fully match human driving capabilities.
Speaker 1:
So, you believe that machines can't understand problems the way humans do, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I think machines can't understand humans. As long as there's even one person on the road, it will confuse all the autonomous vehicles.

Speaker 1:
In other words, you think that if there are fully autonomous vehicles everywhere, it could be chaotic. What if someone intentionally tries to disrupt the system?

Speaker 2:
Exactly. If someone decides to run into the street to see which autonomous car stops first, it could cause a chain reaction of accidents. There are too many unpredictable factors. I believe that for autonomous driving to work, it needs to be in a controlled environment, like specific tunnels or zones where humans and vehicles are separated. Otherwise, it won't be safe.

Speaker 1:
How do you think autonomous vehicles interpret the intentions of pedestrians or other drivers? What do you think their current capabilities are?

Speaker 2:
It all depends on the algorithms. I don't trust the current technology, even the military-grade ones. For example, I joked with a colleague about how difficult it is to calibrate eye-tracking systems for fighter jets. If such technology were applied to civilian use, it would be far from reliable. The precision required for road traffic is much higher than for simple tasks like delivering packages. Autonomous vehicles need to be responsible for passengers and pedestrians, and I don't think current AI algorithms are up to the task.

Speaker 1:
As a driver, how do you judge the intentions of pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles on the road?

Speaker 2:
First, it's about experience. You need to understand the habits of a city. For example, if I drive in Beijing, I know that pedestrians are relatively disciplined. But if I go to a different place where there are no traffic lights and cars don't stop, I need to be extra cautious. You have to adapt to the local conditions, and I believe human brains are more flexible than AI in this regard.
**Speaker 1:**
So, when driving in Beijing, how do you usually judge the intentions of other pedestrians, non-motorized vehicles, and motor vehicles? Let's start with pedestrians. How do you determine their intentions?

**Speaker 2:**
For pedestrians, it's like this. At most crosswalks, you need to yield. If you see a pedestrian on the crosswalk and the pedestrian signal is green, and you need to make a right turn, you must yield, even if it's just one person. However, if you're at a place without traffic lights, you need to slow down and observe the pedestrian. You need to determine if they intend to move forward or if they are just standing still.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you judge whether they want to move forward or stay still? Is it based on their actions or something else?

**Speaker 2:**
It's really about observation. There's no precise standard for this. 

**Speaker 1:**
So, there's no exact standard because people are complex, and their thoughts and actions can change at any moment.

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly. If you see them standing there, you need to slow down. You can't just speed through. You start slowly, and if they move, you stop and let them pass. If they don't move, you proceed. That's the basic logic.

**Speaker 1:**
But if both you and the pedestrian are following this logic, it can lead to a situation where...

**Speaker 2:**
In that case, you need to be flexible. You can wave to let them go first, or they might wave to let you go first. It's about using gestures to communicate intentions.

**Speaker 1:**
What about non-motorized vehicles?

**Speaker 2:**
Bicycles are generally okay, but you need to be cautious with delivery riders. If you see one, slow down and be prepared because they rarely yield. If you see a delivery rider approaching from a distance, start slowing down early.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you judge the intentions of other motor vehicles on the road?

**Speaker 2:**
For motor vehicles, most drivers will use turn signals. Besides obvious signals like turn signals and brake lights, you can also pay attention to honking and flashing high beams. 

**Speaker 1:**
Are there other ways to understand the intentions of other motor vehicles?

**Speaker 2:**
You need to anticipate. For example, if the car in front of you suddenly slows down even though the road ahead is clear, you need to be cautious.
**Speaker 2:**
You need to anticipate certain situations. For example, if you see the car in front of you and the road ahead is clear, but the car suddenly slows down, it might be preparing to make a U-turn or something similar. In such cases, you can either honk or flash your lights to signal your intention to pass, or you can slow down a bit to see what the driver does next. This is especially important on highways. If you notice the car in front of you suddenly changing lanes even though the road ahead is clear, you should follow suit. There might be a large vehicle ahead that you can't see, and it's crucial to follow the lead of the car in front to avoid potential hazards.

**Speaker 1:**
So, if the car in front suddenly behaves unusually, you should...

**Speaker 2:**
Follow its lead. Otherwise, you might end up in a rear-end collision or face some other road hazard.

**Speaker 1:**
I have one last question. Imagine a scenario at an intersection without traffic lights. There's a pedestrian trying to cross the road, and you also need to pass through the intersection. Since there are no traffic lights, there's no clear rule about who should go first. You decide to let the pedestrian go because you don't want to hit them, and the pedestrian also hesitates, fearing you might hit them. Both of you stop, then both of you start moving at the same time, and then stop again, leading to a standoff. How would you handle such a situation? Would you use hand signals? In Beijing, you might encounter this often. Besides hand signals, what other methods do you use?

**Speaker 2:**
I generally don't use the horn.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you mostly rely on hand signals. How do you ensure the pedestrian understands your signal?

**Speaker 2:**
I watch to see if they start moving. If they do, then I wait.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you wait until the pedestrian has completely crossed before you proceed. Got it. I don't have any more questions. Do you have anything to add?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I don't have anything to add at the moment.
Speaker 1:
Oh, this triggered our EH. Did you see the time? This is the absolute time. Yes, this is it. They pressed it when it was triggered. Oh, look at this, 02:37. The first right turn, was it because of this? Were these two non-motorized vehicles here, or did the passenger feel uncomfortable and press it? Is that right?

Speaker 2:
It was quite scary, haha.

Speaker 1:
This is 17 minutes. If it's 02, then it should be later. The U-turn at 02 made him feel uncomfortable.

Speaker 2:
It felt like during the U-turn, he thought we were going to crash.

Speaker 1:
That kind of feeling from the passenger seat.

Speaker 2:
Yes, from the passenger's perspective.

Speaker 1:
But actually, drivers know there's still some distance.

Speaker 2:
Especially for new drivers, they often feel like they're going to crash.

Speaker 1:
Around 21 minutes, he pressed it again. Not sure why he pressed it so frequently. He pressed it twice on this stretch of road. So, the standards are different. Are we done on our side?

Speaker 1:
Do you have any questions about the funds? Hmm, I don't see any particularly risky situations here. You can show it to the driver. Let the driver take a look. Should we review from 4:02 to 4:05, within these three minutes, since he pressed it three times in a row? Yes, let's see what the situation was, and you can roughly guess the reason. The data is from the passenger seat. Yes, starting from 19 minutes.

Speaker 1:
He pressed it for the first time, possibly during the U-turn.

Speaker 2:
Yes, he pressed it during the U-turn, and then throughout this stretch.

Speaker 1:
Hmm, there was a gap of more than a minute without pressing. Yes, he pressed it before the right turn. Yes, he pressed it once.

Speaker 1:
There was no pressing during this stretch. Now, ChatGPT, little handle mail.

Speaker 1:
Starting from here, he might have pressed it many times within a minute. Yes, within one or two minutes.

Speaker 1:
Including what you mentioned earlier, the bicycle. Yes, including the tricycle, within this time frame. The video signal wasn't good. Yes, including overtaking the tricycle and the bicycle, he pressed it many times during this period.

Speaker 2:
He felt that...

Speaker 1:
It was too...

Speaker 2:
Close, the distance was too close.

Speaker 1:
And then at 07:08, 07:08, he pressed it again. After the right turn, you know.

Speaker 2:
There was a person on the road.

Speaker 1:
Yes, there was a person on the road, and he...
Speaker 1:
So, after that, you turned right, correct?

Speaker 2:
Yes, there was a person on the road.

Speaker 1:
There was a person on the road, so you had to press the brake. After turning right, did you encounter any other events?

Speaker 1:
It seems there might have been some obstacles or people on the road. Can you confirm if there were any additional issues?

Speaker 1:
Alright, it looks like we have covered everything for today's interview. There is a form here that needs your input.

Speaker 1:
Your opinion is important. The process will take about 3-4 weeks, similar to receiving a paycheck. I'll end the sharing now.
