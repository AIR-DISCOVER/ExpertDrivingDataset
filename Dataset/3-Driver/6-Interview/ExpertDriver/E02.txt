**Transcript:**

**Speaker 1:**
I’m sharing my screen now.

**Speaker 1:**
Hello, hello, can you hear me? Your mic is still on. Okay, now it’s good. Can you hear me now? It seems to be working. Let me say something to test it.

**Speaker 2:**
Hello.

**Speaker 1:**
Testing, testing. Now, I’m using the built-in microphone on my computer. It seems to pick up sound even from a distance. Let me adjust it. Can you hear me now? Testing, testing. Your voice is very low. I’ll hold the mic closer. Okay, you can use that one. Is this setup okay for you?

**Speaker 2:**
I’m using the built-in microphone on my computer. It should be fine.

**Speaker 1:**
Testing, testing. Okay, it’s working now. Why is there an echo when I speak?

**Speaker 2:**
Because you’re using my computer, and the meeting audio is coming through.

**Speaker 1:**
I’ll turn off the speaker.

**Speaker 1:**
Is it off now?

**Speaker 1:**
I’m having some technical issues here. Can you help me with something? Do you have an old laptop? Can you bring it over? Yes, the thick, old one.

**Speaker 1:**
Sorry, we’re having some computer issues. Can we try switching to another computer? We’re running a bit early today. Do you have any plans later? If we start at 5 PM, we should be done by around 6 PM.

**Speaker 2:**
That’s fine, 6 PM works for me. Should I take off the headset?

**Speaker 1:**
You can keep it on. Okay, I forgot to ask, how did you know about this? Bye.

**Speaker 2:**
I saw the job postings, but I don’t have the education or skills for them. I previously contacted someone named Chu Mengdi about direct hiring.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you give me the meeting ID?

**Speaker 1:**
Three-way call. Yes. 300, then... Hold on, it’s almost ready.

**Speaker 1:**
Is the meeting being recorded?

**Speaker 1:**
Hello, can you say something?

**Speaker 2:**
Hello, can you hear me?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, I see the subtitles at the bottom. You can take notes, and I’ll share the screen with you. This is the data we recorded during the experiment using the glasses you were wearing.
Sure, here is the translated and refined conversation in English:

---

**Interviewer:** Is it okay if you look at the screen?

**Interviewee:** Yes, that's fine.

**Interviewer:** Great. Now, what I'm going to show you is a recording we made during the experiment using the glasses you were wearing. We'll review the driving diagnostics and analyze your driving habits. I might pause at interesting points to ask you some questions. Just respond naturally, like we're having a casual conversation. There's no need to feel nervous.

**Interviewee:** Okay.

**Interviewer:** All the information from this interview will be anonymized, so your personal details won't be disclosed. If there are any questions you're uncomfortable answering, just let me know, and we can skip them.

**Interviewee:** Understood.

**Interviewer:** Let me introduce myself. My name is Chang Xiang, and I'm responsible for this final interview session. If you're ready, we can start. I'll first explain what you're seeing on the screen and what each element represents. For example, this red dot indicates where you were looking at that moment.

**Interviewee:** Got it.

**Interviewer:** The red circle shows where your eyes were focused. You can see it moves around as your gaze shifts.

**Interviewee:** Yes, I see.

**Interviewer:** Now, before we dive into your driving habits, I'd like to ask you a few simple questions. I know you have extensive driving experience. Could you tell me which vehicles you've driven?

**Interviewee:** I've driven a BMW 7 Series, a Range Rover, and a Tesla Model X.

**Interviewer:** So, you've driven both electric and gasoline cars, as well as SUVs and sedans?

**Interviewee:** Yes, that's correct.

**Interviewer:** Have you driven any luxury cars like a Rolls-Royce?

**Interviewee:** No, I haven't driven a Rolls-Royce.

**Interviewer:** So, you've driven some high-end cars?

**Interviewee:** Yes.

**Interviewer:** What type of car do you find easiest to drive?

**Interviewee:** I find sedans easier to drive. I prefer them because my own car is a sedan.

**Interviewer:** Do the cars you've driven have any driver-assist features, like adaptive cruise control, automatic start-stop, or speed control?

**Interviewee:** Yes, they do, but I rarely use them.

**Interviewer:** You've never used them?

**Interviewee:** No, I haven't.
**Speaker 1:** Do you use features like auto start-stop, cruise control, and similar functions? Have you ever tried them?

**Speaker 2:** No, I rarely use them.

**Speaker 1:** You've never used them?

**Speaker 2:** No, I only trust myself.

**Speaker 1:** So, you've never even tried them?

**Speaker 2:** Well, I did try them once with a BMW 7 Series on the Fourth Ring Road.

**Speaker 1:** How was the experience?

**Speaker 2:** It was semi-automatic cruise control.

**Speaker 1:** Semi-automatic cruise control means?

**Speaker 2:** It means, for example, if I set it to 80 mph, I don't need to press the accelerator, but I still need to brake manually.

**Speaker 1:** I see, so you need to decelerate manually. It doesn't automatically slow down if it detects a vehicle too close in front?

**Speaker 2:** At that time, it didn't have that feature.

**Speaker 1:** Have you driven a Tesla? Did you try any of its features?

**Speaker 2:** No, I haven't tried them either. I mainly rely on myself.

**Speaker 1:** Do you drive more short distances in the city or long distances?

**Speaker 2:** Mostly short distances.

**Speaker 1:** How long and how many kilometers per day?

**Speaker 2:** In Beijing, from morning to afternoon, I drive about 50-60 kilometers.

**Speaker 1:** Got it. How do you feel about the car we're discussing today?

**Speaker 2:** It's quite easy to drive.

**Speaker 1:** Any specific or detailed impressions? For example, the accelerator or brakes—did you find anything uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** The car is a bit too low for my height, which feels a bit uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:** I understand. How about the accelerator response?

**Speaker 2:** The accelerator response is quick, and the brakes are good too.

**Speaker 1:** One more question—have you ever been in a traffic accident? If you don't want to answer, that's fine.

**Speaker 2:** In 2009, there was a heavy snowfall, and I had an accident on the airport highway, hitting the rear wheel guardrail.

**Speaker 1:** The car skidded?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it skidded. No other incidents.

**Speaker 1:** Understood. Can we talk about your experiences driving important passengers, like executives or bosses, since you're a professional driver?

**Speaker 2:** My boss is quite cautious.

**Speaker 1:** Cautious?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, he doesn't like driving fast. If I drive too fast, he gets nervous.
Speaker 1: The boss, he's quite timid.

Speaker 2: Yes, he is.

Speaker 1: So, he can't drive very fast, right? If you drive too fast, he gets nervous.

Speaker 2: Exactly.

Speaker 1: So, how do you adapt your driving to his preferences, given that he's quite timid?

Speaker 2: I stick to the speed limits. For example, if the speed limit on the Fourth Ring Road is 80 km/h, I won't exceed that. I make sure not to speed or drive too fast.

Speaker 1: Besides controlling the speed, what else do you pay attention to? Are there other things you consciously control?

Speaker 2: I watch the boss's expressions.

Speaker 1: You observe the passengers' expressions in the car?

Speaker 2: Yes, through the rearview mirror.

Speaker 1: If he looks relaxed, you feel he's comfortable. If he looks tense, you slow down or adjust your driving.

Speaker 2: Yes, if he's playing on his phone, it means the speed is fine. If he's not on his phone and staring ahead, it means I'm driving too fast.

Speaker 1: So, you adjust based on his reactions. If he thinks you're driving too fast or aggressively, how do you adjust?

Speaker 2: He'll usually say something like, "No rush." For example, if we're going from the office to a restaurant and we're short on time, I might drive a bit faster. But if he says, "No rush," I take it as a cue to slow down.

Speaker 1: After he says "No rush," what specific driving adjustments do you make?

Speaker 2: I make sure not to accelerate too quickly.

Speaker 1: You mean not to start too aggressively?

Speaker 2: Yes, especially when the light turns green. I start smoothly.

Speaker 1: Anything else?

Speaker 2: Just drive more slowly overall.

Speaker 1: So, you think controlling the speed is enough. Have important passengers ever commented on your driving, saying it's comfortable?

Speaker 2: Have they given feedback?

Speaker 1: Yes, what do you think you do well that makes them feel comfortable?

Speaker 2: I'm very familiar with Beijing.

Speaker 1: You know the routes well?

Speaker 2: Yes, and I avoid main roads during traffic jams, taking smaller roads instead.

Speaker 1: I see, to avoid congestion. Besides knowing the routes, is there anything else?

Speaker 2: No, just that my driving skills are good.

Speaker 1: Your driving skills are good.
**Interviewer:** Besides being familiar with the route, is there anything else?

**Interviewee:** Hmm, nothing else really. My driving skills are also quite good.

**Interviewer:** Your driving skills are good. In what aspects do you think your driving skills are good? What do you think you do well?

**Interviewee:** It's about the feel of the car.

**Interviewer:** The feel of the car is important.

**Interviewee:** Yes, like maintaining the right distance between the car in front and behind, and changing lanes smoothly.

**Interviewer:** Changing lanes smoothly, yes.

**Interviewee:** Yes, changing lanes.

**Interviewer:** Timing is crucial.

**Interviewee:** I usually change lanes quickly and decisively. You can't hesitate while driving.

**Interviewer:** So, if you want to make the ride more comfortable for your passengers, like your boss or other guests, what would you do?

**Interviewee:** The speed shouldn't be too fast, and lane changes shouldn't be abrupt. I try to provide the most comfortable experience for the passengers.

**Interviewer:** Besides speed and lane changes, what else would you do?

**Interviewee:** No.

**Interviewer:** You shouldn't brake suddenly, right?

**Interviewee:** Yes, if you drive too fast, and other cars are slower, you'll have to brake suddenly after changing lanes. You can't do that.

**Interviewer:** To avoid sudden braking after changing lanes, what strategy or method do you use?

**Interviewee:** I usually observe the direction of the cars. For example, if I'm driving on the Fourth Ring Road and there are 8 cars ahead, I will observe them in advance.

**Interviewer:** You plan your lane change route in advance.

**Interviewee:** Yes, I observe the movement of these cars for a few seconds. Normally, cars stay within the white lines on the road.

**Interviewer:** In the middle, right, they don't cross the lines.

**Interviewee:** Some people don't use their turn signals and just slowly move towards the line before changing lanes. So, I like to observe the direction of the cars.

**Interviewer:** You observe where they are going to change lanes.

**Interviewee:** For example, if a car is moving towards the line, it will likely change lanes. In that case, I won't change lanes.

**Interviewer:** I understand, I get it.

**Interviewee:** If you don't drive often, you might not understand this.

**Interviewer:** I can understand. How do you plan your lane changes? For example, if you want to overtake the car in front, or if you want to pass through a group of cars, how do you do it?
Speaker 1: So, as you mentioned earlier, there are eight cars ahead. I need to pass between them. How do you plan your moves? Which lane do you switch to first, and how do you proceed?

Speaker 2: You overtake the cars one by one, right? For example, if you want to overtake eight cars, you first look at the car closest to you.

Speaker 1: Or the eight cars might not all be in the same lane. Some could be in different lanes.

Speaker 2: You observe their speeds. It's unlikely that all six cars in front of you are moving at the same speed.

Speaker 1: Generally, which side is faster? Usually, the inner lanes are a bit quicker.

Speaker 2: Yes, the leftmost lane tends to be faster.

Speaker 1: How do you usually overtake? I generally...

Speaker 2: I usually overtake from the right.

Speaker 1: Why do you prefer overtaking from the right?

Speaker 2: Because the cars on the right are slower.

Speaker 1: But if the cars are slower, as you mentioned, once you overtake from the right, you might end up right behind another car and have to brake.

Speaker 2: Exactly. For instance, if the car in front is slow, I will be slightly faster, maybe by 10 mph, and overtake it. You can't go too fast because if you brake suddenly, the passengers will feel uncomfortable. I have kids, and they often get car sick.

Speaker 1: So, if you have important passengers like your kids in the car, you still choose to overtake from the right. How do you ensure a smooth experience for them?

Speaker 2: First, I check the right side mirror to see the cars behind. Since I'm overtaking, I will be faster than the cars behind me. Then, I move to the right lane and overtake the car in front.

Speaker 1: So, you switch to the right lane first and then overtake the car in front.

Speaker 2: Yes.

Speaker 1: And if you get close to the car in front in the right lane, what do you do?

Speaker 2: There will still be some distance. I will increase my speed a bit more and overtake it.

Speaker 1: Or you might switch back to the left lane.

Speaker 2: Yes, either to the left or right. When learning to drive, they teach you to overtake from the left.

Speaker 1: Right?

Speaker 2: Yes, but now on the highway, you see many new drivers sticking to the leftmost lane. I usually avoid the leftmost lane because it's often congested.

Speaker 1: Why is that?

Speaker 2: Because it's full of new drivers who follow the navigation and drive very slowly.

Speaker 1: So, you prefer the middle or right lanes, which makes it easier to overtake and change lanes.

Speaker 2: Exactly. If a new driver is on the highway, they will likely stick to the leftmost lane.
Speaker 1:
So, you prefer driving in the middle or right lanes because it makes it easier for you to change lanes and overtake, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. If a new driver gets on the highway, they will definitely stick to the leftmost lane. Nowadays, during holidays like May Day, National Day, or Spring Festival, I drive back to my hometown. But it's tough now because there are so many new drivers. They barely drive 50 meters before checking their navigation. Can they drive fast? No, they can't.

Speaker 1:
Let's go back to the previous question. We care a lot about the passenger experience. For example, when you have important passengers, what extra efforts do you make to ensure their comfort? Or could you share some experiences of driving important passengers? Who were they, what routes did you take, and how did you drive? Did they have any specific requests, and how did you meet them?

Speaker 2:
Once, my boss had to go to the airport, and it was quite late. We were going from Shuangjing Bridge to Terminal 2 at the airport.

Speaker 1:
Terminal 2?

Speaker 2:
Yes.

Speaker 1:
That's about 50-60 kilometers, maybe 40 kilometers?

Speaker 2:
From Shuangjing Bridge to the airport, it's about 20 kilometers.

Speaker 1:
Right, Terminal 2 is a bit closer. There was construction between Terminal 2 and Terminal 3.

Speaker 2:
Terminals 1 and 2 are together, but Terminal 3 is separate.

Speaker 1:
There's about 4 kilometers between Terminal 2 and Terminal 3.

Speaker 2:
Let me see, it's around 8-9 kilometers.

Speaker 1:
10 kilometers, at most 8-9 kilometers.

Speaker 2:
Yes, around that.

Speaker 1:
So, you were heading to Terminal 2.

Speaker 2:
Yes, and it was during rush hour.

Speaker 1:
Traffic was heavy, but you were in a hurry.

Speaker 2:
Yes, it was congested, so we took Guangqu Road.

Speaker 1:
Guangqu Expressway?

Speaker 2:
No, Guangqu Road between the Third and Fourth Ring Roads, which isn't an expressway and has traffic lights.

Speaker 1:
Not the Jingguang Expressway, I understand.

Speaker 2:
Yes, Guangqu Road.

Speaker 1:
So, you had to pass the Third Ring Road and then the Fourth Ring Road.

Speaker 2:
Yes, it was all congested, so we took the side road, which was actually faster.

Speaker 1:
Taking the side road was faster compared to the main road, right? Why is that?

Speaker 2:
Because there are fewer cars on the side road.

Speaker 1:
Fewer cars, but you still have to wait at traffic lights, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, both the main road and the side road have traffic lights.

Speaker 1:
Why does the main road have traffic lights?

Speaker 2:
Both the main road and the side road have traffic lights.
Speaker 1: You have to wait at the traffic lights, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, but...

Speaker 1: Oh, you mean, but I...

Speaker 2: You might...

Speaker 1: At the next intersection, you don't have to, right?

Speaker 2: This is Guanxu Road. After passing the Fourth Ring Road, it's an elevated road with no traffic lights.

Speaker 1: But before the Fourth Ring Road...

Speaker 2: From the Third Ring Road's Shuangjing Bridge to the Fourth Ring Road, there are traffic lights at every intersection, at least eight or nine of them.

Speaker 1: So, the main road and the side road are the same in that regard.

Speaker 2: Yes, you have to wait at the traffic lights. On the elevated road, bicycles also use the side road, but the traffic flow is still relatively fast. At some small intersections, you don't have to wait at the traffic lights.

Speaker 1: What do you mean by not having to wait at the small intersections?

Speaker 2: Because there are no cars. Let me explain more clearly. For example, at a small traffic light ahead, you can't turn left or right, you can only go straight, and it's only for pedestrians. So, you don't have to wait at that traffic light, but many people don't know this.

Speaker 1: So, even if it's red, you don't have to wait?

Speaker 2: Yes, but at major intersections, you must wait. Major intersections are for pedestrians, but not always.

Speaker 1: So, the pedestrian light changes only when someone presses the button, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, that's the light.

Speaker 1: Got it. So, how do you manage to be in a hurry but still make sure the passengers are comfortable?

Speaker 2: You can't drive too fast.

Speaker 1: Do you make any extra efforts?

Speaker 2: Drive slower, and if you can avoid waiting, do so. But you can't break traffic laws. For example, you can turn right first, then...

Speaker 1: I don't quite understand. You mean going straight but making two right turns?

Speaker 2: Yes, if there are many cars going straight, you can turn right, then left, or make a U-turn.

Speaker 1: So, it's not two right turns, but a right turn, then a left turn, and then...

Speaker 2: Yes, you turn right first, then left. At this intersection, you should turn right.

Speaker 1: Do you make a U-turn there?

Speaker 2: No, making a U-turn takes more time. It's not efficient.

Speaker 1: So, you turn right, then left, and then...

Speaker 2: Yes, let me draw it for you. This way, you avoid breaking the rules and no one will honk at you. It's a good method.

Speaker 1: I still don't quite understand.

Speaker 2: I'll draw a diagram for you later. You'll understand then.

Speaker 1: Okay, let's look at this first.
Person 2:
Yes, right, I'll draw a diagram later. Okay, you give it to him.

Person 1:
So, you understand, right? Okay, let's watch this video first. At this point, we have already started driving. Move a bit further, and now we are getting onto the main road. Yes, and there's a turn ahead. I want to ask you, as a driver, what are your usual habits when making a turn?

Person 2:
For a right turn, I first check the left side for bicycles, motor vehicles, and non-motor vehicles.

Person 1:
The left side is where the oncoming traffic is.

Person 2:
Yes, that's right.

Person 1:
So, you check the left side first?

Person 2:
Yes, I check the left side first.

Person 1:
To see if there are any oncoming vehicles?

Person 2:
Yes, exactly. If there are no vehicles, I accelerate a bit and go through quickly.

Person 1:
Do you also check the right side?

Person 2:
Of course, I do. In Beijing, there are many electric bikes going the wrong way. You have to check both sides.

Person 1:
Let's see how you handled it today. You checked the navigation and confirmed it was a right turn. You checked the left side first, but it seems you didn't check the right side as much.

Person 2:
Yes, I always check the left side first.

Person 1:
Got it. So, you usually check the right side less compared to the left?

Person 2:
Yes, if there are no cars on the left, I proceed slowly and then check the right side to see if there are any obstacles or people.

Person 1:
So, as long as there are no cars on the left, you keep moving?

Person 2:
Yes, I move slowly and then check the right side for any potential collisions.

Person 1:
Understood. What about left turns?

Person 2:
For left turns, it's usually the opposite direction.

Person 1:
You check the right side first?

Person 2:
Yes, for left turns, I usually make a wide turn. If it's a wide turn, I don't need to check the left side as much.

Person 1:
Why don't you need to check the left side for a left turn?

Person 2:
Because with a wide turn, you have better visibility. Unlike the sharp turn in the video, a wide turn gives you a clearer view.

Person 1:
Alright, we'll find a left turn to observe later. Now, we are about to enter a service area. My car is a bit stuck here. How do you handle situations with tricycles going the wrong way?

Person 2:
I keep a safe distance and stay to the right.

Person 1:
How do you ensure safety on the right side?
Interviewer: How did you handle that situation? Did you keep your distance?

Driver: Yes, I kept to the right side.

Interviewer: How did you ensure a safe distance between your car and the one on the right?

Driver: It's about having a feel for the car. On my left, there was a three-wheeler, and on my right, there was a car parked on the roadside.

Interviewer: Right, you maintained a safe distance from both.

Driver: Yes, it's about the feel for the car.

Interviewer: What do you look at to ensure you maintain a good distance?

Driver: I look through the car windows at the front left and front right.

Interviewer: I noticed you glanced at the right edge line, the white line, correct?

Driver: Yes, the right side.

Interviewer: So, you also check the left car wheel?

Driver: Not just the wheel, but the whole car.

Interviewer: Understood. Now, when you enter a side road, what is your usual driving habit?

Driver: I first check the left side mirror.

Interviewer: Mainly because you enter from the right side, correct?

Driver: Yes, I check the speed of the cars behind me. If they are slow, I can accelerate and go. If they are fast, I wait for them to pass before I go.

Interviewer: Today, when you checked the left mirror, could you see the cars behind through the bushes?

Driver: The distance was...

Interviewer: It should be hard to see, right?

Driver: Yes, you can't see clearly through the mirror.

Interviewer: You can only see a little bit, right? The car just appeared a little bit.

Driver: Yes, the white car. I think I let it pass, didn't I?

Interviewer: Yes, it was far away, so you could accelerate and go.

Driver: Yes, I accelerated to pass quickly.

Interviewer: So, when you change lanes or enter the main road, you check if the cars behind are slow, then you accelerate and go, right?

Driver: Yes, I give it some gas and move to the left.

Interviewer: Do you usually have to wait long to make a U-turn?

Driver: Yes, sometimes there are five or six cars ahead.

Interviewer: What do you do if a bus blocks your way during a U-turn?

Driver: I reverse a bit because the bus is quite close to the left side.

Interviewer: You mean the bus on the right side?

Driver: Yes, the bus on the right side. If it takes up part of your space, you might not be able to turn properly.
**Speaker 1:** On the right side, there was a bus, correct?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. The bus was taking up part of the space, making it difficult for me to turn. It was very close.

**Speaker 1:** So, you mean the bus in front of you was too close, making it hard for you to maneuver?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, the distance between us was still manageable.

**Speaker 1:** I see. You were mainly focused on the car in front of you and the bus being close to each other.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:** So, you had enough space to make the turn, but it was tight because of the bus?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I managed to make the turn, but it was close. I had to be very careful.

**Speaker 1:** After you made the turn, did you try anything else, like reversing a bit to adjust?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I thought about reversing a bit to make it easier.

**Speaker 1:** Understood. What are your usual driving habits when making a U-turn?

**Speaker 2:** I usually check the left front side.

**Speaker 1:** You mean you look at the left front to see if any cars are coming?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, if there's a red light, I make the turn directly.

**Speaker 1:** Because with a red light, the cars won't move, right?

**Speaker 2:** Exactly. If it's a green light, I wait for the cars to pass or slow down.

**Speaker 1:** So, you make the turn in one go if possible?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, but at this entrance, it requires two maneuvers. Alternatively, I could drive forward past the solid line and make a wider turn.

**Speaker 1:** Is that allowed? Not making the turn at the dashed line?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I can pass the solid line and the crosswalk, then make the turn.

**Speaker 1:** Larger vehicles can't make the turn in one go either, right?

**Speaker 2:** Correct, smaller cars also struggle.

**Speaker 1:** So, you knew in advance that it wouldn't work, and you didn't proceed forward?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. Moving forward would have caused a jam.

**Speaker 1:** If you moved forward, the other car would have had to reverse, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, if there wasn't enough space, it would have been troublesome.

**Speaker 1:** So, you anticipated this when you saw the other car trying to make a U-turn?

**Speaker 2:** Absolutely.

**Speaker 1:** You mentioned the camera was obstructing your hand, making your steering slower?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I usually drive with one hand for quicker reactions.

**Speaker 1:** And then you had to make a right turn. The road was straight and good for acceleration. Can you describe your driving habits in such conditions?

**Speaker 2:** If I know I need to make a right turn in a few hundred meters, I stay on the right side and keep my speed moderate.

**Speaker 1:** Let's not consider...
**Interviewer:** Are you used to it?

**Driver:** Yes, for example, if I need to turn right in a few hundred meters, I would stay on the right side and keep my speed in check.

**Interviewer:** Let's not consider the upcoming right turn for now. How about on a long straight road?

**Driver:** On a long straight road like this, I would...

**Interviewer:** Stay on the left side, right?

**Driver:** Yes, because there are guardrails on the left, so pedestrians, electric bikes, or motorcycles are less likely to appear suddenly.

**Interviewer:** Or other vehicles, right.

**Driver:** If I drive on the right, there are entrances and exits, so cars might come in at any time.

**Interviewer:** What speed do you usually maintain on such roads?

**Driver:** Around 60 km/h.

**Interviewer:** The speed limit on this road is 60 km/h.

**Driver:** I'm not exactly sure.

**Interviewer:** This route is...

**Driver:** 60 km/h, but sometimes I might go a bit faster.

**Interviewer:** What about on the Third or Fourth Ring Roads?

**Driver:** The Third and Fourth Ring Roads have a speed limit of 80 km/h.

**Interviewer:** Do you stick to the speed limit?

**Driver:** Sometimes I drive up to 90 km/h.

**Interviewer:** You drive up to 90 km/h because...

**Driver:** I'm familiar with the road and know where the cameras are.

**Interviewer:** I see. What is your preferred following distance? Let's use a bus as an example. On a typical city road with a speed limit of 40 km/h, what distance do you maintain?

**Driver:** About 10 meters.

**Interviewer:** 10 meters, which is about the distance between two cars.

**Driver:** Yes, about that.

**Interviewer:** The white lines on the road are about 2.5 meters apart, right?

**Driver:** Yes, roughly. Maybe a bit shorter.

**Interviewer:** So, it's about this distance, but slightly longer, right?

**Driver:** Yes, about this distance.

**Interviewer:** And at 60 km/h?

**Driver:** At 60 km/h, I would keep a distance of about two white lines.

**Interviewer:** Two white lines, which is roughly 15 meters.

**Driver:** I remember the white lines being a certain length, but I can't recall exactly. I usually drive based on my feeling.

**Interviewer:** Understood. And at 80 km/h?

**Driver:** At 80 km/h, I would maintain at least...

**Interviewer:** Like this?

**Driver:** Yes, based on that.
Speaker 1:
I see. Hmm, what about driving at 80 km/h?

Speaker 2:
At 80 km/h, you should maintain a minimum distance.

Speaker 1:
Is that necessary?

Speaker 2:
Yes, especially when considering large vehicles.

Speaker 1:
Large vehicles? You mean trucks? They seem far away.

Speaker 2:
Yes, like the one we just passed. That's about right.

Speaker 1:
So, it's roughly the same distance?

Speaker 2:
Yes, but not more than the length of two or three cars.

Speaker 1:
Got it, not more than three cars, around two car lengths. Okay, and on the highway, there are usually signs indicating distances of 50 meters, 100 meters, and 150 meters. What distance do you usually maintain on the highway?

Speaker 2:
Around 100 meters, not more than that.

Speaker 1:
Not more than 100 meters. And what speed do you usually maintain on the highway?

Speaker 2:
Around 130 to 140 km/h.

Speaker 1:
130 to 140 km/h. Okay, and when approaching a turn, I noticed you checked your rearview mirror early on. What was your intention?

Speaker 2:
I was checking if the car behind was approaching quickly.

Speaker 1:
Why? To judge if the car behind was speeding?

Speaker 2:
Yes, if it's speeding, it might rear-end me. So, I signal early to alert the driver behind.

Speaker 1:
I see. So, if there's no car behind, you wouldn't signal?

Speaker 2:
Correct, if there's no car, I wouldn't signal. But if there is, I would.

Speaker 1:
You stopped briefly here. Why?

Speaker 2:
To check if there were any bicycles coming from the side road.

Speaker 1:
Were you blocked by bushes or something?

Speaker 2:
Yes, the bushes blocked my view. Once I moved halfway, I could see the situation in the rearview mirror clearly.

Speaker 1:
During the actual driving test, did anything happen that made you feel it was dangerous?

Speaker 2:
Not this time.

Speaker 1:
Alright. At the next intersection, I'll ask you again. There's a pedestrian crossing the road ahead. Did you slow down?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I did. And at the next intersection, I turned right. There was a car ahead.

Speaker 1:
But no non-motorized vehicles, right? So, you observed the same way as before?

Speaker 2:
Yes, checking the right rearview mirror.

Speaker 1:
I see. You checked the right rearview mirror to ensure there were no bicycles or pedestrians.

Speaker 2:
Yes, mainly looking for electric bikes. When I was about 15 meters from the traffic light, I was already checking.

Speaker 1:
15 meters, at that point...
Speaker 2:
Yes, mainly focusing on the electric vehicle. Actually, when I was about fifteen meters away from the traffic light, I was already observing the surroundings.

Speaker 1:
Fifteen meters, at that point.

Speaker 2:
Can you understand? Can you understand?

Speaker 1:
Yes, I can understand that. Around that time.

Speaker 2:
Let me see. Just around that time.

Speaker 1:
Just then, I noticed someone seemed to be getting out of the taxi next to me. Is that right? Or not?

Speaker 2:
It doesn't matter if they get out. The main thing is to watch the speed of the electric vehicle. If it's faster than me, I will definitely check again. If the electric vehicle is particularly slow, I will turn right without needing to check the right rearview mirror. This means there are no cars or people in the auxiliary lane behind me.

Speaker 1:
So, you observe the auxiliary lane situation in advance before turning.

Speaker 2:
Yes, about 15 to 20 meters in advance, but the exact distance can vary.

Speaker 1:
I understand. And after you turn, I will ask you some other questions. If there's something specific you want to share, you can let me know anytime. So, to ensure safety during this drive, what were you particularly focused on today?

Speaker 2:
I was particularly focused because it was my first time driving this car, so I couldn't drive too fast. I needed to understand the braking distance of this car. The braking distance is quite short, and the brakes are good.

Speaker 1:
Anything else besides that? For example, when you noticed the red light starting to flash, indicating the need to slow down and possibly stop, what were your thoughts at that moment?

Speaker 2:
At that moment, I thought there was an entrance to a residential area ahead, and I assumed the car in front was going to turn right to pick up passengers. But it didn't turn right.

Speaker 1:
So, it ended up blocking your lane.

Speaker 2:
It blocked more than half of my lane. So, in such a situation, if I had to brake suddenly, it would be uncomfortable for the passengers. I chose to steer slightly to the left and pass through the middle, but at a slow speed.

Speaker 1:
How did you ensure the distance between the cars on the left and right when you were in the middle? Any incident at that moment would be your responsibility.

Speaker 2:
That's why the speed couldn't be too fast. I had to gauge the distance between the cars, relying on my sense of the car's dimensions.

Speaker 1:
So, you feel confident in your ability to judge the distance between the cars on both sides.

Speaker 2:
Yes, and I immediately returned to my lane after passing.

Speaker 1:
Back to the previous question, what other areas did you focus on during the drive, besides the braking system?
Speaker 1:
Let's go back to the previous question. During your driving experience, what other aspects did you pay attention to besides the automatic braking distance? To ensure safety, what else did you focus on?

Speaker 2:
Since the road is surrounded by residential areas, I definitely paid attention to pedestrians and electric bikes.

Speaker 1:
So, you would make a judgment about the surroundings in advance, right? For example, if it's a road within a residential area, you would be extra cautious about people crossing the street.

Speaker 2:
Yes, definitely. But the speed of the car must be kept low.

Speaker 1:
How much would you reduce the speed by?

Speaker 2:
Around 40 to 50 km/h. You need to understand the stopping distance of your car. On such roads, you can't drive fast because there are electric bikes on both sides.

Speaker 1:
Besides what you mentioned, is there anything else you focused on to ensure the safety of the experiment?

Speaker 2:
No, nothing else.

Speaker 1:
So, there was nothing additional you paid attention to?

Speaker 2:
No.

Speaker 1:
While driving, did you do anything specific or pay special attention to anything?

Speaker 2:
Since there were passengers in the car, I made sure their ride was comfortable. That's about it.

Speaker 1:
So, you made an effort to ensure the passengers were comfortable. Can you think about what specific actions you took to ensure their comfort? After that, I'll ask you some other questions, particularly about safety. Do you think there's anything else you did for safety?

Speaker 2:
For safety, reducing the speed is the most important thing.

Speaker 1:
So, reducing the speed is the safest approach. If I ask you how to drive more safely, your answer would be to reduce the speed?

Speaker 2:
Not just that.

Speaker 1:
For this road, or for the entire experiment, or even for regular driving, what else would you do?

Speaker 2:
First, I need to stay focused. I can't get distracted, especially at the beginning. Then, I need to observe more.

Speaker 1:
Observe more?

Speaker 2:
Yes, for example, if I'm 50 meters away from another car, I need to see if it's signaling or not. You have to watch the movements of other cars.

Speaker 1:
Observe the movements of other vehicles. What if they don't signal?

Speaker 2:
You still need to anticipate their actions.

Speaker 1:
How do you make such anticipations if they don't signal?

Speaker 2:
By closely watching their behavior and being prepared for any sudden changes.
Speaker 1: That sounds great. So, how do you anticipate such situations? For instance, if the other driver uses their turn signal, it's easy to predict. But what if they don't use their turn signal? How do you judge then?

Speaker 2: In such cases, I usually keep a distance of about 20 meters, give myself 20 seconds to react, and sometimes use the horn to alert them.

Speaker 1: I see. For example, if a car is parked on the side and you are driving on its left, it might start moving at any moment. You can use the horn to give a warning. What other measures do you take to ensure safer driving?

Speaker 2: Staying focused and not getting distracted is crucial.

Speaker 1: Yes, you mentioned that. Is there anything else you can think of? If not, we can move on to the next question.

Speaker 2: Maintaining a proper speed is also important.

Speaker 1: Alright, no problem. Take your time to think about it. Let me ask you another question. Can you recall any driving scenarios that you find particularly frightening or challenging?

Speaker 2: Right turns, especially those with dual right-turn lanes, are quite scary.

Speaker 1: Dual right-turn lanes? Why do you find them particularly frightening?

Speaker 2: Because sometimes there are no guiding lines on the road.

Speaker 1: You mean there are no lane markings?

Speaker 2: Yes, some intersections don't have those guiding lines. For example, after you make a right turn, there might be a section without any lines.

Speaker 1: So, the guiding lines are like dashed lines that help you stay in your lane, similar to the ones for left turns?

Speaker 2: Exactly, especially in Beijing. If those lines are missing, the two right-turn lanes might merge into one.

Speaker 1: So, the turning paths could eventually converge into a single lane?

Speaker 2: Yes, and in Beijing, from 7 AM to 9 AM, the rightmost lane is reserved for buses. So, if two cars are turning right simultaneously...

Speaker 1: They might end up in the same lane.

Speaker 2: Yes, because one of the lanes is a bus lane. This situation is quite concerning.

Speaker 1: I understand. The main issue is the large blind spots.

Speaker 2: Yes, the car on the inside lane might not see the car on the right.

Speaker 1: So, the inside car can't see you on its left?

Speaker 2: Exactly. For instance, if both cars are turning right, the inside car might not see the outside car.

Speaker 1: The inside car might collide with the outside car, especially at the rear left side?

Speaker 2: Yes, for example, if we both turn right and one lane is a bus lane, I can't move into the bus lane.
Speaker 1: Is that so?

Speaker 2: Yes, for example, if we both turn right, and this is a bus lane, I definitely can't go into the bus lane. I have to avoid it because the speed is not fast. In such a situation, I can see it.

Speaker 1: He's in front of you on the left, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, he's in front of me on the left. Can I see him? I definitely can.

Speaker 1: It's possible that your car's front end is already there, but he can't see you.

Speaker 2: Yes, he can't see me. That's when accidents happen.

Speaker 1: So you might end up scraping his right rear blind spot.

Speaker 2: Yes, and my left front.

Speaker 1: The rear end of his car, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, his right rear and my left front.

Speaker 1: I understand this situation. Are there any other scenarios?

Speaker 2: Another one is people using their phones.

Speaker 1: Do you mean people using their phones while driving or walking? 

Speaker 2: While driving. When you see someone using their phone through their car window, it can be very scary.

Speaker 1: Did you honk to remind them?

Speaker 2: Yes, I did yesterday. It's very common.

Speaker 1: Anything else?

Speaker 2: Another situation is running yellow lights. There are a lot of people who do that now.

Speaker 1: Why is running yellow lights particularly scary?

Speaker 2: Because at some large intersections, the yellow light lasts a long time. When the light turns green for the cross traffic, the car running the yellow light is still in the middle of the intersection. This happens a lot in Beijing because many cameras are outdated and don't work properly.

Speaker 1: Any other situations?

Speaker 2: Another one is large trucks making turns.

Speaker 1: And where are you in relation to the truck?

Speaker 2: I'm on its right rear side, which is a blind spot for the truck driver. For example, on a two-lane road, if the truck is in the left lane and making a right turn, it can't see me.

Speaker 1: Especially if the sun is in their eyes.

Speaker 2: Exactly. Are there any other scenarios?

Speaker 1: Yes, people changing lanes erratically.

Speaker 2: Yes, people who don't signal when changing lanes. For example, if I'm driving in the leftmost lane and maintaining a safe distance of 20 meters from the car in front, and suddenly a car cuts into that space, I have to brake hard.

Speaker 1: Right, you have to brake suddenly.
**Speaker 1:** There was a 20-meter braking distance, and suddenly a car cut in.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it merged into that 20-meter gap.

**Speaker 1:** So, you had to brake hard, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I had to slam on the brakes.

**Speaker 1:** That makes it easier for the car behind you to rear-end you.

**Speaker 2:** There's no other choice. That driver didn't observe the traffic properly and just cut in.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think you have any driving habits that might be dangerous?

**Speaker 2:** Let me think. I usually drive a bit fast.

**Speaker 1:** Driving fast, okay. Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** Not really. I don't like using my phone or listening to music while driving. I focus on driving.

**Speaker 1:** Is there anything else you can think of, like other habits that might be risky?

**Speaker 2:** The most dangerous thing would be using my phone, but I avoid that.

**Speaker 1:** When you're a passenger, what makes you feel nervous or unsafe?

**Speaker 2:** Because I can drive myself, I often feel uneasy when others are driving.

**Speaker 1:** Why is that?

**Speaker 2:** I always feel like they don't maintain a safe braking distance. It feels like they won't be able to stop in time.

**Speaker 1:** So, you think others don't manage the braking distance as well as you do. Anything else that makes you nervous?

**Speaker 2:** When they drive too fast.

**Speaker 1:** Driving too fast, like how?

**Speaker 2:** For example, on the highway, I drive at 120 km/h, but they might go 150 km/h. That makes me nervous.

**Speaker 1:** Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** No, that's about it. Mainly the braking distance. I get really tense in taxis sometimes.

**Speaker 1:** Now, I have some questions about your passengers' comfort. Do you pay attention to their experience when you drive?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, definitely.

**Speaker 1:** What do you pay attention to?

**Speaker 2:** Even though I usually drive fast, if I have passengers, I control my speed and avoid sudden braking or acceleration.

**Speaker 1:** Got it.
Speaker 1:
When there's someone in the car, I tend to control my speed more consciously.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I drive slower and avoid sudden braking or acceleration.

Speaker 1:
Got it. Is there anything else? You mentioned that having someone in the car makes you drive differently. Besides speed, what other changes do you make?

Speaker 2:
Psychologically, it feels different. I feel a responsibility to ensure the passenger's safety.

Speaker 1:
How does this psychological difference affect your driving behavior?

Speaker 2:
As I mentioned, I drive slower, avoid sudden braking, and don't accelerate quickly.

Speaker 1:
Are there any other adjustments you make? Besides controlling speed, there are other factors to consider, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, there are other factors.

Speaker 1:
Do you increase the following distance between your car and the one in front?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I increase the following distance.

Speaker 1:
How much do you increase it by?

Speaker 2:
Within my control range, I extend the braking distance.

Speaker 1:
So, you extend it within a safe range. Got it.

Speaker 2:
I've driven both Japanese and German cars. Japanese cars tend to have softer brakes, which means a longer braking distance. For example, at 60 mph, a Japanese car might need an extra 3-4 meters compared to a German car. I used to drive a Nissan, which had this characteristic.

Speaker 1:
I understand. Besides increasing the following distance, what else do you do?

Speaker 2:
I also avoid making sharp turns.

Speaker 1:
How do you control that?

Speaker 2:
I reduce my speed before turning.

Speaker 1:
Is reducing speed enough?

Speaker 2:
Yes, reducing speed and observing the surroundings.

Speaker 1:
What do you observe?

Speaker 2:
For example, when making a right turn, I check for pedestrians and cyclists.

Speaker 1:
Do you think this improves passenger comfort?

Speaker 2:
Yes, because passengers might be distracted, like using their phones, so it's the driver's responsibility to be vigilant.

Speaker 1:
So, you mean you observe more on their behalf?

Speaker 2:
Yes, the driver should always be observant.

Speaker 1:
You also ensure not to follow the car in front too closely, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, you shouldn't make the passenger feel uncomfortable by being too close to the car ahead.

Speaker 1:
I understand. Anything else?
**Speaker 1:**
Do you think you might be driving too close to the car in front?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, you shouldn't need others to remind you that you're too close. Keep a safe distance.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it. Is there anything else I should pay attention to, to make passengers more comfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really.

**Speaker 1:**
Maybe chatting to ease the atmosphere?

**Speaker 2:**
Actually, I don't get nervous with anyone in my car. I've been driving for a long time, so I'm always relaxed. When people are nervous, it affects their braking and lane changes. Nervous drivers hesitate a lot, but I can change lanes in half a second.

**Speaker 1:**
What are some of your bad driving habits that might make passengers uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Driving fast and making sharp turns.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you mean by sharp turns? How do you make turns more smoothly?

**Speaker 2:**
When you turn, it should be a smooth arc, not a sharp angle. If you make a sharp turn, the passengers will be thrown to one side.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you avoid that?

**Speaker 2:**
Slow down.

**Speaker 1:**
What are the specific details of your actions? How do you steer, accelerate, and brake?

**Speaker 2:**
For example, if there's a median strip, I first check if the car behind me is too close. If it is, I signal three times, then start turning. Once the front of the car is past the median, I check the side mirror. If the coast is clear, I proceed. If there are other cars, I wait.

**Speaker 1:**
So you accelerate and straighten the wheel once it's clear?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, if it's clear, I go. If not, I wait.

**Speaker 1:**
Any other habits that might make passengers uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Changing lanes erratically when in a hurry.

**Speaker 1:**
Right, like you mentioned earlier.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I might do that when driving alone, but not with passengers.

**Speaker 1:**
What behaviors from other drivers make you uncomfortable when you're a passenger?

**Speaker 2:**
Sudden braking. It makes people feel dizzy and uncomfortable.
**Interviewer:** What driving behaviors of others make you feel uncomfortable as a passenger?

**Interviewee:** The most uncomfortable thing is sudden braking. It makes people feel dizzy and nauseous, and some might even vomit.

**Interviewer:** Anything else besides sudden braking?

**Interviewee:** Sharp turns. The centrifugal force can be quite strong.

**Interviewer:** Anything else?

**Interviewee:** Using a mobile phone while driving.

**Interviewer:** Using a phone while driving?

**Interviewee:** Yes, some drivers will drive for a bit and then reply to messages. It's very annoying and irresponsible, both to themselves and to others.

**Interviewer:** Considering passenger comfort, you've mentioned a few points. Do you think there's anything else that can be done to make the ride more comfortable? For instance, if you want to excel as a professional driver and provide better service to passengers, what areas can be improved?

**Interviewee:** There are definitely areas for improvement.

**Interviewer:** Let's focus solely on driving. We're not talking about other aspects like interpersonal skills. Just driving.

**Interviewee:** In terms of driving, being familiar with the road conditions and focusing on driving are crucial. Ensuring that passengers reach their destination in the shortest time possible is important.

**Interviewer:** So, being familiar with the road conditions helps avoid traffic and ensures quicker arrival. Besides that, what else?

**Interviewee:** Safe driving is another key aspect.

**Interviewer:** Safe driving? Ensuring safety is the main priority. Anything else you think can be improved?

**Interviewee:** Good driving habits are also very important.

**Interviewer:** For example, correcting the bad driving habits you mentioned earlier. Anything else? You mentioned that you avoid those bad habits when you have passengers. Are there any other areas where you think you can improve or that you already excel in?

**Interviewee:** Safety should always come first during driving.

**Interviewer:** Safety first. Right.

**Interviewee:** Mainly focusing on driving without any distractions, like smoking or using a phone.

**Interviewer:** Anything else?

**Interviewee:** No, that's about it.
Speaker 2:
Yes, I don't engage in any other activities like smoking or playing with my phone while driving.

Speaker 1:
So, there's really nothing else, no areas for improvement that you can think of?

Speaker 2:
I've been driving for over ten years. I think it's fine because I don't have many bad habits. 

Speaker 1:
Got it. Alright, let's proceed. I'll play the video, and we can pause to discuss any points as needed. Now, I'll ask you a few questions that might be a bit challenging. Let me take a look at this entrance because it seems quite complex. How did you observe the situation at that time? Can you explain it to me again?

Speaker 2:
At that time, I had a red light.

Speaker 1:
Yes, you had a red light.

Speaker 2:
Yes, and the light for the adjacent lane was green. I was considering the straight-line visibility.

Speaker 1:
There would be a lot of vehicles moving straight ahead.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I could see from a distance because of my field of vision.

Speaker 1:
Right.

Speaker 2:
So, I approached the solid line and reduced my speed to observe. I noticed two bicycles on my right. If there were no cars on the left, I could make a right turn without those bicycles moving. If they did move, it would be a problem.

Speaker 1:
You noticed those bicycles early on, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I saw them at that time.

Speaker 1:
Because they were stopped at the red light. Then you made a right turn.

Speaker 2:
Yes, but I mainly checked the left side. If there were no cars on the left, I could proceed manually.

Speaker 1:
Wait a moment. I noticed that you glanced at the bicycles again after passing them. Did you see that?

Speaker 2:
Yes, when they appeared near the passenger window.

Speaker 1:
From the back seat, you could see their position. At that point, your car had already passed the white line.

Speaker 2:
Yes, it had passed.

Speaker 1:
And there was at least one vehicle going the wrong way. Did you see that?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I slowed down and passed.

Speaker 1:
There was another vehicle going the wrong way on the right side.

Speaker 2:
It was a bicycle, a security guard. I remember clearly. I definitely checked the left side first. There was a Passat on the left.

Speaker 1:
A Passat on the left?

Speaker 2:
Yes, it was moving slowly.

Speaker 1:
So, you just went ahead.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I went ahead because the Passat was slow.
Speaker 1:
So, was it this Passat?

Speaker 2:
Yes, this Passat was moving slowly.

Speaker 1:
Right, so you just overtook it. Yes, I overtook it directly because I saw that it was trying to cut in even though it saw me coming.

Speaker 2:
It had its right turn signal on.

Speaker 1:
But it still changed lanes, right? It was in the middle lane.

Speaker 2:
Yes, it was moving slowly.

Speaker 1:
How did you handle the situation?

Speaker 2:
I let it go. Whether it was turning left or right, I let it go.

Speaker 1:
But it signaled quite late. You see, even at that point, it hadn't signaled yet. It seemed like it was trying to cut in, right?

Speaker 2:
In such situations, I can wait. Do you know why? Because there were no cars behind it. So, I just waited.

Speaker 1:
It was in a hurry to turn into the office building, and it forced you to stop. You couldn't change lanes because there were too many cars on the left. It was really close on the right side.

Speaker 2:
The camera was recording the whole time.

Speaker 1:
So, you felt there was still some distance, right?

Speaker 2:
But I felt it was very close, about 20 centimeters at most.

Speaker 1:
But you couldn't turn left because there were cars coming from that direction.

Speaker 2:
I was already on the edge of the lane. If an accident happened, it would be my fault since this is the auxiliary road of the Fourth Ring Road, right?

Speaker 1:
Let's look at the video again. Why were you driving so close to the left line for such a long time? You had already passed the Passat, but you continued to drive close to the line. Your left wheels were always on the edge.

Speaker 2:
There were no cars coming from the left. I checked the rearview mirror to make sure.

Speaker 1:
So, you were aware of the situation.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I checked the rearview mirror. There were no cars behind, so I could drive along the line, but not for too long. This also depends on personal driving habits. That car was parked improperly with its hazard lights on, waiting for someone.

Speaker 1:
You were also checking the situation on the right side. There was an electric bike close to you.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I saw it. It was quite close.

Speaker 1:
Were you thinking of waiting for it?

Speaker 2:
I was worried it might not stop in time.
Speaker 2:
Yes, I took a quick look, it was quite close to me.

Speaker 1:
Did you think about waiting for him or something?

Speaker 2:
I was afraid he wouldn't be able to stop, so I decided to wait. I was worried he wouldn't be able to brake in time and would crash into our car.

Speaker 1:
I understand, you were afraid he wouldn't be able to stop and would hit our car. So, you didn't dare to brake and wait for him because he was in your rearview mirror.

Speaker 2:
No, he was still a bit of a distance away.

Speaker 1:
He was a bit of a distance away. Right, he was behind the car.

Speaker 2:
Yes, he was definitely at a distance. If he were right behind, I would have hit him when I turned right. But driving requires decisiveness, so I just went ahead. The road conditions were complex, and they were driving against traffic.

Speaker 1:
They were driving against traffic, so you had to slow down to let him slow down.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I let him pass.

Speaker 1:
And then the car in front of you continued to overtake, but he gave up and slowed down.

Speaker 2:
Yes, because there was a trash can on the left and another car on the right, he had to slow down. At that moment, you need to control the distance and pass slowly. Suddenly, two people appeared, and I could only see them when they were in the middle of the road.

Speaker 1:
I see, because the left side blocked your view.

Speaker 2:
Yes, the two cars were side by side.

Speaker 1:
So, how would you handle such a situation? 

Speaker 2:
In such a situation, if I can't see clearly, I won't accelerate.

Speaker 1:
I understand, you wouldn't accelerate.

Speaker 2:
Yes, my foot would be ready to brake in case someone suddenly appears.

Speaker 1:
You anticipated that if someone appeared, it would be dangerous.

Speaker 2:
Yes, you have to think ahead.

Speaker 1:
You thought about it in advance.

Speaker 2:
If you don't, and two people suddenly appear, and you accelerate, you will definitely hit them.

Speaker 1:
At that moment, there were two cars.

Speaker 2:
Yes, there were two cars about 10 meters apart.

Speaker 1:
You can't measure it by length, you have to measure it by width.

Speaker 2:
By width, you mean the distance between the front of the two cars. From this point to that point, it's about 10 meters.

Speaker 1:
No, it was less than 10 meters.

Speaker 2:
It looked like about 10 meters, maybe a bit less.

Speaker 1:
There were a few trees on the right side.

Speaker 2:
Three trees, I think.

Speaker 1:
Three trees.

Speaker 2:
Yes, three trees in that section.
Speaker 2:
Almost there.

Speaker 1:
You can see a few trees on the right.

Speaker 2:
There are four trees there.

Speaker 1:
Three trees, actually.

Speaker 2:
Three trees, right. And there's a space of about 4 meters between them. That's enough to park, right? I usually park with a 12-meter distance, and I slow down to about 10 meters per second. I should make a right turn here.

Speaker 1:
How do you handle electric bikes going the wrong way? They might not be exactly going the wrong way; they might be trying to make a left turn but end up in your lane.

Speaker 2:
I consider that going the wrong way because they're in my lane. They should be in their own lane.

Speaker 1:
So, if it's a three-wheeler, they should be in their own lane, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, they should be in their own lane. I would just slow down and let them pass.

Speaker 1:
Let me ask you a few more questions. What do you think makes a good or professional driver?

Speaker 2:
A professional driver should be familiar with the road conditions and have good driving skills. It's also important to handle situations well and communicate effectively.

Speaker 1:
What do you think a good or professional driver should at least be able to do?

Speaker 2:
Take care of the vehicle.

Speaker 1:
Yes, taking care of the vehicle is important. What else?

Speaker 2:
You should...

Speaker 1:
Let's focus on driving aspects.

Speaker 2:
Avoid aggressive driving.

Speaker 1:
What do you mean by aggressive driving?

Speaker 2:
Some people drive recklessly. You should develop good driving habits.

Speaker 1:
Develop good driving habits. For example, when making a left turn at an intersection without traffic lights, you should be extra cautious. Why do you look to the right first?

Speaker 2:
I look to the right to check for any oncoming vehicles, then to the left.

Speaker 1:
You look to the right first because the car might come quickly, and you won't be able to react in time if you don't check. Then you look to the left.

Speaker 2:
Yes, because there are no traffic lights, I have to check both sides.

Speaker 1:
If there were traffic lights, you wouldn't need to check the right side.

Speaker 2:
If there were traffic lights, I would only need to check the left side.

Speaker 1:
If the left turn signal is green, you can turn left directly, but you still need to watch for bicycles on the right.

Speaker 2:
Yes, the situation at each intersection can be different.
**Speaker 1:**
When you were about to make a left turn without an arrow, and then the left turn arrow appeared, you could turn left directly. You mainly checked if there were any bicycles coming from the right. In this particular situation, there was no signal light at the entrance. Several cars rushed in, so the traffic volume was quite high. When turning left or right, you must yield to oncoming traffic. I waited for a gap and then took my turn.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, you have to check the right side again. I noticed that when you saw the other driver yielding to you or slowing down to make a right turn, you immediately checked the right side.

**Speaker 1:**
If the car on the right is making a right turn, I won't proceed. Especially if there are two cars turning right from the nearby community, it takes more time.

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly, it gives me enough time to check if there are any cars on the right before proceeding.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you look at the cars coming from the left to see if they intend to turn left or right, and then you determine if your turn will conflict with theirs.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it. If there are no cars coming from the right, you proceed with the turn. Right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's correct.

**Speaker 1:**
Okay. Now, what do you think is the biggest difference between new drivers and experienced drivers?

**Speaker 2:**
First of all, new drivers lack a feel for the car.

**Speaker 1:**
A feel for the car?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, and when they turn, they don't observe as carefully as I do. They might just turn right if there's no obstruction in front of them, without considering how far the car on the left is or how fast it's coming. New drivers usually drive slower and don't process as many factors.

**Speaker 1:**
I see. In this situation, you yielded to the other driver, right? But technically, they should have yielded to you because you were going straight, and they were turning.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, they hesitated a bit in the middle.

**Speaker 1:**
If they had turned faster, you might have let them go, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, if their car was moving faster, I would have let them go. But they were hesitant and slow.

**Speaker 1:**
So, in such cases, you usually yield a bit.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's right.

**Speaker 1:**
This might be a tough question, but what do you think are the limitations of autonomous vehicles compared to human drivers?
**Speaker 1:**
Hmm, this question might be a bit challenging. Do you think there are aspects where autonomous vehicles can't match human drivers?

**Speaker 2:**
Well, currently, it's not that they are significantly worse than humans, but in the future, it might be that almost all vehicles will be autonomous.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you believe that autonomous driving can replace human drivers like yourself?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I think it can. I believe it can.

**Speaker 1:**
You think they can match or even surpass human capabilities in all aspects?

**Speaker 2:**
Because technology is very advanced now. For example, if there are 100 cars on the road and 90 of them are autonomous, I feel that the overall speed would be faster in reaching the destination.

**Speaker 1:**
Why is that? Is it because they follow predetermined paths and don't make sudden lane changes like humans, which can cause disruptions?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, if there are 100 cars on the road and 10 of them are autonomous while the rest are human-driven, the speed won't be as fast.

**Speaker 1:**
It would be slower because human drivers would affect the flow.

**Speaker 2:**
Some drivers might cut you off intentionally. We all understand this.

**Speaker 1:**
They deliberately block your way.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, they might block your way, or there could be other unpredictable behaviors. For instance, if someone cuts you off at an entrance and doesn't let you pass, they might catch up and block you again. Autonomous cars can't always ensure the safest or most optimal response. If someone forces you to stop, your speed will decrease, right?

**Speaker 1:**
I understand. So, if a car suddenly appears, I noticed you swerved to the left. Why did you do that?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I swerved to the left a bit.

**Speaker 1:**
Were you afraid it might suddenly come out?

**Speaker 2:**
Because there was an electric bike on the right side.

**Speaker 1:**
Which car were you avoiding by swerving left?

**Speaker 2:**
Not a car, but the electric bike's path was the same as mine. If you look closely, I swerved left a bit.

**Speaker 1:**
Which electric bike?

**Speaker 2:**
The one in front of the car.

**Speaker 1:**
You swerved left because you were worried it might suddenly turn left. Got it.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, and the passengers wouldn't feel uncomfortable with such a small adjustment.

**Speaker 1:**
When you're driving, how do you judge the intentions of other pedestrians, non-motorized vehicles, and cars on the road?

**Speaker 2:**
I look at...
During the driving process, for example, when encountering non-motorized vehicles, how do you judge the intentions of other pedestrians, non-motorized vehicles, and cars on the road?

Speaker 2:
Do you look at their direction?

Speaker 1:
Yes, direction. What do you mean by direction?

Speaker 2:
Do you observe the movement of the vehicles?

Speaker 1:
Movement, exactly.

Speaker 2:
For instance, if an electric bike is going to turn left, the rider will definitely look back to check for cars. They won't just turn without looking. In such situations, I usually don't honk. For example, that woman in white wanted to turn left, but she saw a car coming from behind.

Speaker 1:
So she went back, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, she went back. In such cases, honking might help, but if you're too close, it might not be effective.

Speaker 1:
How do you determine what they intend to do? Let's start with pedestrians. How do you judge their intentions?

Speaker 2:
By observing their direction?

Speaker 1:
And how do you observe their direction?

Speaker 2:
Through careful observation.

Speaker 1:
So you observe their body movements, for example?

Speaker 2:
Yes, like their footsteps.

Speaker 1:
Or the direction their face is pointing, or if they make eye contact with you, and so on?

Speaker 2:
Eye contact is less likely; it's more about their actions. Like the woman earlier, what did she intend to do?

Speaker 1:
She was on a non-motorized vehicle, not a pedestrian.

Speaker 2:
Are you asking about pedestrians?

Speaker 1:
Yes, I'm asking about pedestrians.

Speaker 2:
Pedestrians are simpler because they move slower. They usually don't move unpredictably. When driving, their speed is around 5 mph, which is much slower than cars. If they are walking, you just let them go. If they are not moving, you can proceed.

Speaker 1:
How do you judge if they will walk or not?

Speaker 2:
Well...

Speaker 1:
Some people might just be standing by the roadside, and it's hard to tell if they will start walking or not. They might suddenly start running the next second.

Speaker 2:
It's a mutual understanding. For example, if a car is 10 meters away from me and moving at a decent speed, it won't just rush out. Do you understand?

Speaker 1:
So you think they won't dare to rush out directly?

Speaker 2:
Yes, and you shouldn't drive too fast. Just go slowly. If a pedestrian is 50 meters away and you are driving at 80 mph, the pedestrian will likely cross because they feel they are far enough from you.

Speaker 1:
Right, they feel they are far enough.

Speaker 2:
But as drivers, our first reaction is to brake.

Speaker 1:
What about non-motorized vehicles?

Speaker 2:
You need to observe their direction. You can't always tell if they will turn left without them looking back.

Speaker 1:
Non-motorized vehicles are different from cars; they can turn very quickly. If you don't anticipate their movements in advance, you might not have enough time to react.
Speaker 1:
As a non-motorized vehicle, it's different from a car. It can turn very quickly. If you don't anticipate its movements in advance, you might not react in time.

Speaker 2:
Yes, you have to watch its direction.

Speaker 1:
The front of the vehicle is facing left.

Speaker 2:
No, I'm behind it, so I can only see its rear. For example, if it's following a straight line and suddenly veers to the left, it probably wants to make a left turn or something. You judge based on these movements.

Speaker 1:
Like just now, it turned left and then came back.

Speaker 2:
Yes, it came back after turning left.

Speaker 1:
So, it's hard to judge its intentions. For safety, you might steer left a bit. Actually, you could also not steer.

Speaker 2:
Yes, you could also not steer and just stay close to it.

Speaker 1:
So, you mean you always steer left a bit to avoid it, regardless of whether it wants to turn left or not.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I make sure to avoid it slightly.

Speaker 1:
You avoid it slightly to prevent any instability.

Speaker 2:
Yes, because I make small adjustments.

Speaker 1:
It's very hard to judge, so even if you think it won't turn immediately, you still give it some space.

Speaker 2:
Yes, motor vehicles must yield to non-motorized vehicles and pedestrians.

Speaker 1:
Is it easier to judge the intentions of other cars?

Speaker 2:
Yes, it's easier because they signal.

Speaker 1:
What if they don't signal or use the horn? How do you judge their intentions?

Speaker 2:
Changing lanes takes time, maybe one or two seconds.

Speaker 1:
So, if you see a slight lane change, you can anticipate it.

Speaker 2:
Yes, if it starts to cross the lane line, you know it's going to change lanes. No one changes lanes abruptly because it's dangerous and uncomfortable for passengers. They do it gradually, and even without signaling, the car behind has to yield.

Speaker 1:
Alright, let's look at this right turn. Here comes a bus at high speed. It doesn't seem to yield.

Speaker 2:
Buses don't yield because you don't know how many people are on board. An abrupt stop could injure passengers.

Speaker 1:
But then it stops in front and blocks your way.
Speaker 1:
You should always yield to the bus because you never know how many people are on it. If the bus has to make a sudden stop, someone could get hurt.

Speaker 2:
Right, but then the bus stopped in front of you, blocking your way, and you had to change lanes to the left. Did the car behind you let you in?

Speaker 1:
Yes, it did. I checked my rearview mirror, and it seemed like that was the case.

Speaker 2:
Got it.

Speaker 1:
So, you changed lanes, and then you reached a U-turn entrance. Let me give you a scenario: there's an intersection without traffic lights, and there are pedestrians and vehicles trying to cross. How do you judge the intentions of the pedestrians or non-motorized vehicles?

Speaker 2:
Since there are no traffic lights, pedestrians might cross whenever they feel it's safe. Similarly, without traffic lights, you can also proceed when you think it's safe. In such situations, how do you decide whether to yield to them or go first?

Speaker 1:
Out of courtesy and traffic ethics, how do you handle it?

Speaker 2:
According to traffic rules and common courtesy, vehicles must yield to pedestrians.

Speaker 1:
Yes, like yielding to pedestrians. This rule has been enforced more strictly recently. So, theoretically, we should always yield to pedestrians, right?

Speaker 2:
If a pedestrian is already at the intersection, I will definitely let them go first. For example, if I'm driving north and the pedestrian is crossing from east to west, I will let them go first. I might honk to alert them or wave my hand.

Speaker 1:
So, you would honk or wave to let them know you're yielding?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I usually wave my hand. They can see it from inside the car.

Speaker 1:
So, you use these gestures to communicate that you're letting them go?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I often wave my hand.

Speaker 1:
But what if they also signal that they're letting you go?

Speaker 2:
If they let me go, then I'll go first.

Speaker 1:
Because neither of you knows if the other is going to yield or go first. 

Speaker 2:
For example, if there's a pedestrian at the intersection and there are five cars behind me, as the first car, I will definitely wave to let the pedestrian go first. If the cars behind me are not in a hurry, they might also wave to let me go first.

Speaker 1:
So, they might also signal to let you go.
Speaker 1: If you wave them on, right? We have four or five cars behind us waiting. If they're not in a hurry, they'll wave you on first.

Speaker 2: Yes, they often wave you on. Of course.

Speaker 1: I often wave to other drivers to let them go first.

Speaker 2: Do pedestrians also wave to you?

Speaker 1: Yes, it happens often on the roadside.

Speaker 2: They let you go first. Yes, because of the steps.

Speaker 1: If they are in a hurry, they definitely won't let you go first. But I'm not like that.

Speaker 2: If they don't wave to you, some people will wave, and some won't.

Speaker 1: Generally, I don't like to rush with cars.

Speaker 2: You don't like cars honking at you.

Speaker 1: Yes, for example, if a traffic light can let 40 cars pass, I wait for others to go first.

Speaker 2: But sometimes there might not be a traffic light.

Speaker 1: At the zebra crossing, yes. For example, at the entrance of my community, there's no traffic light, just a zebra crossing.

Speaker 2: You let the cars go first, and then when there's a gap, you cross.

Speaker 1: It's easier for people to stop, but cars need to brake.

Speaker 2: As a driver, sometimes you stop, and the pedestrian stops too. Then you both start moving again at the same time, which can be awkward.

Speaker 1: Yes, it can be awkward. In such cases, the car should stop first.

Speaker 2: Yes, the driver should stop first, regardless of whether the pedestrian stops or not.

Speaker 1: What about electric bikes? Are they easier to deal with or more difficult to judge?

Speaker 2: Electric bikes are not easy. They often try to rush through.

Speaker 1: They rush through even if your car is close?

Speaker 2: Yes, even if your car is very close, if they're in a hurry, they'll go. Delivery riders often get into accidents because they don't care about the rules. Even if your car is 10 meters away, they think they can make it. If the car doesn't brake, they can't make it. A car going 60 km/h covers about 10 meters in a second.

Speaker 1: Yes, at 60 km/h, it's about 10 meters per second.

Speaker 2: Exactly. They think they can make it on an electric bike, but they can't. In such cases, the car must stop and let them go.

Speaker 1: What about other situations?
**Speaker 1:**
There are situations where people on electric bikes think they can cross, but they actually can't. This isn't a motor vehicle, so motor vehicles must give way.

**Speaker 2:**
Right, but there's another situation. For example, many people cross the road without looking at the traffic lights. If you let the first person go, then a whole group will follow. I know what you mean; you won't be able to move at all, and you'll have to wait for a long time.

**Speaker 1:**
So, what would you do in that situation?

**Speaker 2:**
I would slowly inch forward.

**Speaker 1:**
How exactly would you do that?

**Speaker 2:**
I would keep my foot on the brake and slowly inch forward.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you describe it in more detail? For example, if there's a person in front of you.

**Speaker 2:**
If there are 100 people in front of me, and one person starts crossing, the other 99 will follow. They walk very slowly. If my car has already reached the middle of the intersection and is at the crosswalk, I would slowly inch forward.

**Speaker 1:**
Would you look to see if there are any cars or if anyone is scared and might let you pass?

**Speaker 2:**
It's not about scaring them. It's about time. They can speed up a bit.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you would inch forward to make them move faster?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, especially if they are young people. I would slowly inch forward.

**Speaker 1:**
What if you could stop the first person from crossing? If the first person hasn't crossed yet and is trying to decide whether to let you go or not, and you know that once they cross, everyone else will follow, what would you do?

**Speaker 2:**
It depends on how wide the road is. If they are already in the middle, you have to let them go. If they are just about to start crossing and haven't reached the middle yet...

**Speaker 1:**
If they are just about to start crossing and haven't reached the middle yet, what would you do?

**Speaker 2:**
If my car is moving fast, I might honk the horn. If the speed is around 40-50 km/h, which is normal for an intersection, and there are too many people, like 100 or 200, I would definitely honk. Generally, I wouldn't let them pass easily.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you would honk to signal that you are going to pass?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I would honk to signal that I am going to pass.

**Speaker 1:**
When you honk, are you trying to scare them or just signal your intention?

**Speaker 2:**
It's not about scaring them. It's just to signal my intention.

**Speaker 1:**
But aren't you worried that even if you honk, they might still keep walking?

**Speaker 2:**
I'm not worried. I might also flash my headlights. These are all options.

**Speaker 1:**
So, if you see them step back or hesitate, you would speed up and pass?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly.
Speaker 1: Were you nervous?

Speaker 2: Not really. Or maybe just flash the high beams, right? That works too.

Speaker 1: So, if you see the other driver backing off or something, you just speed up and go past them, right?

Speaker 2: If you wait, 100 people could cross the street.

Speaker 1: It would take more than 5 minutes for everyone to cross.

Speaker 2: I haven't timed it, but it would definitely take several minutes.

Speaker 1: And it's not the right time to wait.

Speaker 2: Exactly.

Speaker 1: Okay, I don't have many more questions. Thank you very much for your cooperation. Let's finish reviewing this U-turn section. It seems like you've been waiting here for quite a while.

Speaker 2: Yes, there were about ten cars ahead.

Speaker 1: Oh, it looks like you had to turn back again.

Speaker 2: Yes, I had to wait for a while. In such situations, I usually check the right side.

Speaker 1: Check the right side? Where exactly?

Speaker 2: Yes, the right side, to see if there are any pedestrians or cyclists coming from the right side of the bus.

Speaker 1: Any pedestrians?

Speaker 2: Or electric bikes running the red light.

Speaker 1: So, you pay special attention when large vehicles block your view to see if anyone is crossing.

Speaker 2: Actually, at this intersection, the traffic is usually slow. Even if my view is blocked, it's not a big deal. You just need to be cautious.

Speaker 1: I see. There was also a pedestrian dragging something and moving close to the left side.

Speaker 2: Yes, the speed decreased. You see that electric vehicle slowing down.

Speaker 1: Do I have any more questions? I'm not sure. Okay, so here a bicycle was blocking your lane, and you stayed very close to the left side.

Speaker 2: Yes, very close to the left side to ensure safety.

Speaker 1: And then the vehicle was gone.

Speaker 2: Yes, I didn't ride on the curb. 

Speaker 1: Lastly, I noticed you seemed to be in a hurry. Let's fill this out.

Speaker 2: Yes, we can stick this here.

Speaker 1: Okay, and you didn't have any data to report, right? Once we finish this, the interview will be over.

Speaker 2: Then the payment will be transferred to the bank.

Speaker 1: To your bank account, right? Yes, as compensation. I'll end the meeting now.
