**Interviewer:**
Do you remember to share your screen? Yes, now it seems there's no point in applying for the computer.

**Interviewer:**
Why does this microphone sound different than before? Testing, testing, is the sound better now? Testing, can you hear me?

**Interviewer:**
Testing, testing, oh, like this.

**Interviewer:**
What's this?

**Interviewer:**
Did the previous two AIs use this place?

**Interviewer:**
Alright, then create the portion on drive E. You just create the project on drive C. Okay, the car is back, it's open, so I'll go get my course. No problem.

**Interviewer:**
So, Danwei, this video is from when you just started driving. I watched it carefully, and we will use this video for analysis.

**Interviewer:**
We think, yes, right, this is our interview. Let's officially start. Let me introduce myself again, my name is Changxiang, and I will be responsible for the final interview session today. You asked me earlier about the data we collect, including some issues recorded during the interview. For today's entire experiment, all data, including this final interview recording, will be anonymized and no personal information will be disclosed. As mentioned earlier, we will review the eye-tracking video of your driving. We will explore your driving habits together, and at any interesting point, either you or I can pause the video to discuss specific actions and your thoughts and observations in detail. Let's start with some simpler questions. Why is it like this?

**Interviewer:**
Why can't it be done throughout? Where is the machine?

**Interviewer:**
I'm not here, then switch back to version 10.

**Interviewer:**
Okay, then wait a moment.

**Interviewer:**
Alright, let's start with some simpler questions. What types of vehicles have you driven before? Earlier, you mentioned driving larger vehicles like buses or those with more seats. What about regular cars? Have you driven gasoline cars, electric cars, SUVs, or small passenger cars?

**Interviewee:**
Basically, for small passenger cars, I've driven an Audi, a Nissan Cedric (imported), and a Land Rover SUV. We also have a Buick, which is also a small SUV.
**Speaker 1:**
Have you driven any of the newer electric or hybrid cars?

**Speaker 2:**
I haven't driven electric or hybrid cars much. I did drive an electric car once, just on a rare occasion.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, among the cars you've driven in the past, did any of them have driver assistance features?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the car I mainly drive now is a GAC Trumpchi GS4, which has some driver assistance features. For example, when using cruise control, you can adjust the distance to the car in front. If the car in front slows down, it automatically slows down as well. I've also tested its automatic braking feature, where if the car in front stops suddenly, it will stop too.

**Speaker 1:**
So you've tried these features. How was your experience with them?

**Speaker 2:**
Honestly, if the distance is far, it's fine. For instance, if I'm 100 meters away from the car in front and have cruise control and driver assistance activated, it's generally okay. But if a car suddenly cuts in between, the system reacts abruptly. You can feel a sudden deceleration, which is different from manually braking. When you brake manually, your body instinctively braces for the impact. But with the automatic system, the car's computer immediately reduces speed, which feels uncomfortable and can be quite startling.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you drive more in the city or on long trips?

**Speaker 2:**
I drive more short trips, but I do take long trips occasionally.

**Speaker 1:**
So, mostly short trips?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, mostly short trips.
**Speaker 1:** Do you drive long distances more often?

**Speaker 2:** I drive short distances more often, but I do have some long-distance trips as well.

**Speaker 1:** So, you mostly drive short distances, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I mostly drive short distances.

**Speaker 1:** Because you are a professional driver, an administrative driver, you tend to do more short-distance pickups and drop-offs.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I mostly do short-distance pickups and drop-offs. Previously, I used to handle airport transfers to Daxing or Capital Airport, mainly for receiving leaders. Now, it's mostly short trips within the city, with occasional long-distance trips. When I bid for jobs myself, I tend to get more long-distance trips.

**Speaker 1:** How do you feel about our vehicle in this experiment? Are you comfortable driving it?

**Speaker 2:** It's good. The throttle response and smoothness are impressive. The car drives well without feeling strained. There's no issue with acceleration; it feels smooth and responsive. The driving experience is quite satisfactory.

**Speaker 1:** Can you share some experiences of driving important passengers?

**Speaker 2:** Sure. When driving our leaders, punctuality is crucial. Sometimes, due to traffic in Beijing, which is unpredictable, you have to be honest about the situation. Driving habits for such trips are different; it's not always as smooth as today. For events or less critical meetings, the focus is on safety and maintaining a steady speed. For important trips, we usually have a strict schedule to follow.

**Speaker 1:** Can you describe a specific instance when you had an important passenger and how you handled the situation?

**Speaker 2:** I often felt anxious, worried about delaying the leader. When you're anxious, you tend to accelerate more aggressively, especially in traffic. However, no one has ever complained about my driving being too rough or uncomfortable. Even though I was anxious, the leaders never mentioned any issues with my driving.

**Speaker 1:** When driving important passengers, what do you pay special attention to?

**Speaker 2:** The first thing I pay attention to is...
**Speaker 1:**
When you are driving important passengers, what do you pay special attention to?

**Speaker 2:**
The first thing I pay attention to is safety, especially in situations where I need to drive fast or when there's heavy traffic. No matter how fast or aggressive I drive, safety must always come first. I can't break traffic rules. Nowadays, with so many cameras around, you really can't afford to break the rules. Even if you don't get caught by a camera, someone might take a picture of you violating the rules.

**Speaker 1:**
I understand. So, even in normal driving situations, you pay attention to these things?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I pay attention to the brakes, the accelerator, and how I start the car. I try to avoid giving the passengers a jerky ride. I want them to feel comfortable. I also make sure to yield to pedestrians and electric bikes. It's important to ensure safety, especially since you never know when an electric bike or a pedestrian might suddenly appear. Safety is always on my mind.

**Speaker 1:**
Have you ever been in a traffic accident?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, over the years, I've had a few minor incidents. The most memorable one was a minor scrape. I was driving on the Fourth Ring Road and got distracted. I looked down for a moment, maybe at my phone, and didn't notice the car in front of me slowing down. When I looked up, it was too late, and I bumped into the car. Fortunately, there was no significant damage, and the other driver didn't make a big deal out of it. But it was a wake-up call for me to never get distracted while driving.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it was a rear-end collision?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was. The front of my car hit the rear of the other car, but it was just a minor bump.

**Speaker 1:**
I see. It must have been a bit of a scare for you.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was. Even though it was a minor incident, it really shook me up. It made me realize how important it is to stay focused while driving.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it. Now, let's take a look at today's video. I'll skip to the part where the incident starts. Can I ask about your usual driving habits?
**Speaker 1:**
Today, we have a video. Let's jump to the moment when we started the trigger. Can I ask about your usual driving habits, especially regarding turning? Let's start with right turns since we have two right turns at the beginning. What are your usual turning habits?

**Speaker 2:**
When I approach an intersection, I always signal early. Depending on which direction I'm turning, I use the corresponding turn signal. As I get closer to the intersection, I first check for pedestrians. If there are none, I look to the left, even if I'm turning right.

**Speaker 1:**
Let's focus on right turns for clarity.

**Speaker 2:**
I first look to the left to check for any oncoming vehicles, bicycles, or pedestrians. If there are none, I quickly glance to the right to check for any vehicles going the wrong way. If it's clear, I proceed with the turn. If there's a car approaching from a distance, I judge its speed. If it's moving slowly, I turn. If it's fast, I let it pass before turning right.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, let's review your two right turns today. You mentioned you start observing the left side early. How far in advance do you start checking the left side?

**Speaker 2:**
Generally speaking...

**Speaker 1:**
For example, when exiting a parking lot with a left turn, you start checking the left side early for oncoming traffic.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I take an initial glance.

**Speaker 1:**
And then you check again here.

**Speaker 2:**
Typically, I start checking about 50 to 100 meters before the turn, depending on the situation. In a parking lot, the view might be obstructed.

**Speaker 1:**
Let's look at the final turn. There are many intersections with turns.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes.

**Speaker 1:**
At this point, you start observing the pedestrians on the right. Why is that?

**Speaker 2:**
I check both sides for pedestrians and vehicles. When I reach the intersection, I need to know if the car behind me or in front of me will affect my turn.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you were observing that electric bike?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the electric bike.

**Speaker 1:**
When approaching the intersection, do you try to pass before the bike?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I check if the bike will turn left. If I stop in front of it, I make sure not to block its path.
Speaker 1: At the intersection?

Speaker 2: No, you're right. What I meant was that I need to see if the car ahead of me is going to turn left. If I stop in front of him, I won't give him a chance to see my side mirror. I'm afraid he might turn left and go against traffic. I'm turning right, and our car has blind spots. Yes, there are blind spots in the field of vision. Got it, I understand.

Speaker 1: So, just now, you were looking at those two computers, and then you glanced to the left. Here, you were actually looking at the oncoming traffic.

Speaker 2: Yes, I was actually checking the side mirror.

Speaker 1: You were looking at the side mirror.

Speaker 2: Sometimes I use my peripheral vision to check the side mirror.

Speaker 1: Got it.

Speaker 2: When we were learning to drive, we were taught to check the mirrors every 3 to 5 seconds.

Speaker 1: Glance at the side mirrors.

Speaker 2: Yes, glance at both side mirrors. That's the basic rule. Nowadays, it seems like some people don't even check the mirrors before turning. When I see that, I slow down because I can't be sure if they're using their mirrors.

Speaker 1: So, at this point, you were looking to the left.

Speaker 2: Yes, at the oncoming traffic. I was checking the cars. You see, they were blocking the way, so I had to look carefully to see if any cars were coming from the opposite direction. Got it.

Speaker 1: Alright, we’ve reached the destination. Let's take it slow.

Speaker 2: The road conditions here are particularly complex.

Speaker 1: Yes, the conditions on this side road are indeed complicated.

Speaker 2: These turns are quite tricky. The road conditions, as you can see, are challenging.

Speaker 1: In such situations, you can't just honk. You have to maneuver carefully. How do you usually handle this?

Speaker 2: In situations like this, you have to check if there are cars on the right. Do you see them?

Speaker 1: I can reverse a bit.

Speaker 2: First, I need to check if there are any cars on the right. You see, these cars are parked illegally, taking up the bike lane. Right?

Speaker 1: They end up taking your lane.

Speaker 2: In such cases, you have to let them pass because they have no other lane to use. It's not their fault. But look, there's an Audi coming. I won't honk. You shouldn't push it either. If he lets me pass, I can go. In such situations, you can't honk. The first rule of driving is to be courteous and civilized. Motor vehicles should yield to non-motor vehicles. Look, there's another white car ahead. I need to predict if it will turn in, so I can't accelerate or honk. Honking might scare them.
Speaker 1:
Look, there's another white car ahead. I need to predict if it's going to cut in again, so I don't dare to accelerate or honk. Can you press the horn again to warn it?

Speaker 2:
It needs to move into the non-motorized lane. Right.

Speaker 1:
Yes, into the non-motorized lane. So, I don't dare to overtake it. I'll just keep moving slowly, right? Look, there's another car coming the wrong way. I saw it from a distance, so I need to give it some space.

Speaker 1:
So, you're more worried about the car on the right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, there's definitely no car on the left since I'm driving close to the left side. I have to stop now. I'll slow down and see if it goes right or left. If it insists on going left, I'll have to let it pass. If there's no car on the right, I'll steer slightly to the right and go past it. You can't really argue with someone driving the wrong way. Honestly, it's tough driving these days. Look, there's another car coming the wrong way from the left.

Speaker 1:
Are you afraid of these cars?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I'm afraid of the ones coming from the right. You have to be cautious because if they come too close, it could be my responsibility if there's an accident. Even if they don't hit my car, if they slow down because of me, it's still a problem. The traffic police will say it's my fault because I'm the one driving a car. So, I have to keep a safe distance from them.

Speaker 1:
At this moment, are you checking the left side mirror?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I'm checking the left side mirror to see where my wheels are. Even though I have a good sense of my position, I still need to check to avoid hitting the left lane. Now, I'm also checking the rearview mirror to see if there are any cars behind.

Speaker 1:
Oh, I see. So, you already have some experience.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I need to check the mirrors and keep a safe distance. 

Speaker 1:
Can you see the cars behind you in the rearview mirror?

Speaker 2:
No, the view is blocked by the flowers in the middle. When I slow down, I need to check the speed of the cars behind. If they're fast, I don't dare to change lanes. If they hit me, it's my responsibility. You need to be familiar with traffic regulations. For example, you need to yield to oncoming traffic when turning. If you change lanes and cause an accident, it's your fault.
Speaker 1:
So, when you enter a side road, what is your usual driving habit? Is it the same as today? Because today, your observation was somewhat limited.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I always slow down when I observe. I remember that’s how I usually do it.

Speaker 1:
And normally?

Speaker 2:
Yes, normally I do the same. That’s my habit.

Speaker 1:
Can you describe in more detail your usual driving habit when entering a side road?

Speaker 2:
Generally, when I’m about to enter a side road, whether from a main road to a side road or vice versa, it’s the same process. I usually slow down by braking as I approach the junction. After reducing speed, I slightly tilt my head to get a better view of the road ahead. If I see that the road is clear or the approaching vehicle is at a safe distance, I turn on my indicator and proceed. If there’s a vehicle coming, I turn on my indicator in advance and stop to let it pass before I proceed. This is especially important when moving from a main road to a side road, as there are often fast-moving electric bikes and bicycles that don’t slow down.

Speaker 1:
Understood. And this section of the road is quite good, a straight road. Can you tell me about your driving habits when maintaining a steady speed on a straight road?

Speaker 2:
During the day, I usually check my side mirrors every 3, 5, or 10 seconds to be aware of any vehicles approaching from behind. At night, the headlights of other vehicles make it easier to know if there’s a car behind. During the day, without the lights, I need to be more cautious. Since I drive at a moderate speed and don’t make sudden turns, I focus on looking ahead.

Speaker 1:
Got it. What speed do you usually maintain? We can consider different speed limits for different roads. For instance, on a road with a 60 km/h speed limit, but not a ring road, what speed do you usually maintain?

Speaker 2:
In such cases, I tend to drive a bit faster.

Speaker 1:
How fast exactly?

Speaker 2:
Around 40 to 50 km/h. Driving at that speed is usually fine for such roads.

Speaker 1:
But you don’t exceed the speed limit?

Speaker 2:
No, I don’t exceed the speed limit. If there’s a car in front of me, I try to maintain a steady speed and avoid driving too fast. I frequently check my surroundings to avoid accidents, especially from vehicles coming from behind. Since I know the route well, I usually stick to my lane and keep a consistent speed.
Speaker 1:
Because I'm afraid of getting into an accident, especially if there's a car behind me. In situations like this, I know the route well and I know I need to stay focused, so I generally don't turn right. I just keep going straight, and I don't drive too fast. If there's a car in front of me, like you mentioned earlier, I usually maintain a steady speed. If the road is clear, I might go a bit faster.

Speaker 1:
If you have important passengers in the car, do you have any different driving habits?

Speaker 2:
In that case, I would drive at a constant speed and not too fast.

Speaker 1:
Constant speed?

Speaker 2:
Yes, for example, if the speed limit is 60 km/h, I might drive at 40, 50, or even 30 km/h depending on the situation. If the road conditions are good, I pay attention to traffic lights. First, I try not to slow down abruptly. Second, I observe whether the light is red or green. If it's red, I start easing off the accelerator well in advance. This way, I can maintain a smooth speed and avoid sudden braking, which can be uncomfortable for passengers.

Speaker 2:
If it's a green light and the speed limit is 60 km/h, even if there are no cars, I might accelerate to 30 or 40 km/h. I also observe the traffic lights from a distance. For example, if I see a green light 200 meters ahead, I know it will take me at least 10 to 15 seconds to reach it. If the light changes, I either risk running a red light or have to brake suddenly.

Speaker 1:
Especially if you have important passengers, like a boss, right?

Speaker 2:
Exactly. So, when I see a green light, I accelerate but cautiously. If I notice the pedestrian signal flashing, indicating the light is about to change, I don't speed up to 60 km/h. Instead, I maintain a steady speed of 30 or 40 km/h and prepare to slow down. This way, I can brake smoothly without causing discomfort.

Speaker 1:
What is the typical distance you like to maintain from the car in front of you? You can describe it based on different speed limits.

Speaker 2:
To be honest, I prefer to keep a close distance to the car in front of me.

Speaker 1:
So, you usually follow closely?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I tend to keep a short distance.

Speaker 1:
What kind of distance do you usually maintain? For example, when you need to make a U-turn.

Speaker 2:
I know, let's take a look...
**Speaker 1:**
Recently, most of the drives have been quite short, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's correct.

**Speaker 1:**
So, what kind of distance do you usually maintain from the car in front of you? For example, when we need to make a U-turn ahead. I understand, let's take a look.

**Speaker 2:**
You see, I always turn on my indicator in advance. It's a habit of mine.

**Speaker 1:**
So, from this point, the distance is quite far, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but if there's a traffic light, for instance, and this lane is for U-turns, I know that the car ahead is also making a U-turn. In normal driving conditions, I maintain a distance similar to the car on the right. If I am driving alongside another car, I keep a similar distance.

**Speaker 1:**
The distance like the white car?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the distance like the white car.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you maintain this distance, or a bit closer?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, if the situation allows.

**Speaker 1:**
So, in general, you prefer to keep this distance from the car in front of you?

**Speaker 2:**
Approximately, yes.

**Speaker 1:**
About one and a half car lengths?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, around seven to eight meters.

**Speaker 1:**
Not quite two car lengths, maybe around six meters. And how does this change with different speeds?

**Speaker 2:**
On the highway, if I need to overtake, I sometimes get very close to the car in front. This is because there might be traffic congestion, and I need to find gaps between cars. I turn on my indicator, move into the gap, and then accelerate to overtake. But if there's a traffic jam, I won't get too close because you can't drive fast anyway.

**Speaker 1:**
So, at lower speeds?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, at lower speeds, you don't have to worry about rear-ending someone. But at higher speeds, I maintain a distance similar to the white car.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it. Now, let's look at today's U-turn. Can I ask why you turned left and then right?

**Speaker 2:**
I wanted to move slightly to the right first and then make a full turn to the left. That was my plan.

**Speaker 1:**
I see. So, after the car in front moved, I noticed you checked your mirror.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I checked the mirror.

**Speaker 1:**
And then you started turning left. Why was that?

**Speaker 2:**
I wanted to get close to the edge on the left and then turn right, aligning with the right lane.

**Speaker 1:**
Why did you turn left first?

**Speaker 2:**
This was actually my third attempt at making the U-turn. Honestly, I was a bit frustrated that I didn't make it the first two times.
Speaker 1:
So, this was your third time driving, right? You mentioned that you didn't manage to make the turn this time. How did you feel about it?

Speaker 2:
Yes, this was my third time. Honestly, I felt quite frustrated because I managed to make the turn perfectly the first two times. This time, I made a mistake. When I turned right, I was checking the mirrors to avoid any accidents and make sure I didn't scrape anything.

Speaker 1:
I see. So, when you were making the U-turn, what were you focusing on?

Speaker 2:
I was checking if my right front wheel could make it through. I visually estimated that it wouldn't, so I had to adjust my turn. The first two times, I made it in one go. This time, I was a bit frustrated because I couldn't get it right.

Speaker 1:
Understood. So, during this part of the drive, it was mostly straight driving without much complexity. Did you have to change lanes or overtake any vehicles during the experiment? If not, I won't ask about it. But could you tell me about your usual habits when changing lanes or overtaking?

Speaker 2:
When I change lanes or overtake, I usually consider two scenarios. If the car in front is moving very slowly, I want to overtake it. First, I check the left mirror to see if there are any fast-approaching cars. If there are, I turn on the indicator and wait for them to pass. If the cars behind are slow, I turn on the indicator and change lanes when it's safe. After overtaking, I signal again to return to my original lane.

Speaker 1:
Got it. During the second right turn, I noticed you were looking through the greenery quite early. Were you checking for vehicles on the road you were about to turn onto or the non-motorized lane on your right?

Speaker 2:
I was checking the non-motorized lane on my right for electric bikes. I also looked through the rear window because there's a blind spot that the mirrors don't cover. You have to be very careful and slow down to ensure safety.
**Speaker 1:**
How do you usually handle right turns at intersections to ensure safety?

**Speaker 2:**
It's crucial to stop whenever possible. Always try to stop if you can.

**Speaker 1:**
Are there any specific techniques for handling the steering wheel?

**Speaker 2:**
There aren't many special techniques for the steering wheel. You should signal your turn early. For example, if you know you need to turn ahead, check the traffic in front of you. As you approach the turn, signal early and start turning slowly. Even if you just edge the car forward a bit, other drivers will see you and yield. Then, you can continue turning slowly.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you gradually adjust the steering wheel and then straighten it out a bit?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, you need to adjust based on the road conditions. If there are many cars, you have to go slower. The key is to be slow and cautious, not too fast.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you mean by "slow"?

**Speaker 2:**
Whether it's a single or double lane, you need to ensure there are no cars on your right when you turn. After turning, straighten the wheel slowly and check the road ahead to avoid entering another lane. If you turn too quickly, you might end up in the wrong lane, which is dangerous.

**Speaker 1:**
When do you usually accelerate during a right turn?

**Speaker 2:**
I usually start to accelerate after I've made the turn and checked that there are no cars or electric bikes. Once I see it's clear, I gently press the gas pedal.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you recall when you typically start to accelerate?

**Speaker 2:**
I start to accelerate when I begin to straighten the wheel after the turn. If there are no cars or if they are far away, I ensure it's safe and then gently press the gas. You shouldn't accelerate too quickly during the turn; it should be gradual for the comfort of the passengers.
**Speaker 1:** When I saw it was safe, I gave a little gas. You can't just floor it when you're turning; if you go too fast, it can be uncomfortable for the passengers and yourself. Otherwise, the car might jerk.

**Speaker 1:** Hold on, let me stop for a moment. Are you noting the time? Do you remember how to log the time? Or are you using something else to keep track? Okay, so at this moment, a garbage truck in front of us suddenly dropped a bag of trash. Although such incidents are rare, they are very dangerous. For example, if the vehicle in front drops something. Yes, it's fortunate this happened on a city road. If it were on the highway and a truck dropped something, it would be terrifying. How would you generally handle such a situation?

**Speaker 2:** Are you asking about handling it on the highway or in the city?

**Speaker 1:** Let's start with the city.

**Speaker 2:** In the city, I try to anticipate whether I can avoid it. If it's something my wheels might run over, I would steer to the left because there's no time to brake. If I'm the only one in the car and it's close, I wouldn't brake because there's no oncoming traffic. If there were oncoming traffic, I would have no choice but to hit the object rather than risk a head-on collision. Generally, in such situations, I drive slower if there are other cars around. But if there's no traffic, I leave myself some room to maneuver. If the object falls right in front of my wheels, I would steer left since there's no oncoming traffic.

**Speaker 1:** So, after steering, you would overtake the vehicle, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, but I would steer gently. If I see I can pass safely, I wouldn't make a sudden move.

**Speaker 1:** What were you looking at during this time? Why were you looking there?

**Speaker 2:** I was checking the navigation system. It was almost out of battery, so I glanced at it to see how much power was left. It might have caused me to make a slightly larger movement. I was checking to ensure it wouldn't shut down mid-trip.

**Speaker 1:** At that moment, you started checking the rearview mirror, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I was checking for electric bikes or other vehicles. You see, at this intersection, there are parked cars, and it's a green light. Suddenly, if someone comes from the opposite direction, you have to be cautious. If you take the turn too tightly, you might collide with them. So, I always look both ways.

**Speaker 1:** What if there's a large vehicle obstructing your view?
Speaker 1:
When you encounter a large vehicle that obstructs your view, how do you usually handle it?

Speaker 2:
I generally try to keep a bit of distance by moving slightly to the left. This way, I can be more alert to any potential hazards, like people or cars suddenly appearing in front of the large vehicle. By moving left, I give myself more room to react. If something does come out, I make sure my speed is manageable so that I can brake in time. For instance, when making a U-turn, I noticed a small van parked on the side. It had been there for a while, and I had to cross the center line to pass it. I was worried that someone might suddenly open the door, which could lead to an accident. Parked cars on the roadside can be quite dangerous.

Speaker 1:
If there were no cars on the right side, would you still keep to the left?

Speaker 2:
No, I would drive normally. If there are no cars on the roadside and my view is clear, I would proceed with caution at intersections. I always judge whether my speed allows me to stop in time. If I can stop safely, I will approach the intersection at a reduced speed without braking unless necessary. If I see a car emerging, I ensure I can stop with one press of the brake. I don't drive recklessly on such roads.

Speaker 1:
So, today, you deliberately stayed closer to the left side of the road because of the large vehicle?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. I moved slightly to the left, crossing the center line to avoid the large vehicle. There was also a van ahead, and I had to be cautious. 

Speaker 1:
And there was another large vehicle blocking the road?

Speaker 2:
Yes, but it was stationary. I continued driving straight, ensuring it was safe to pass. When the road was clear, I overtook the vehicle quickly. Sometimes, other drivers don't keep to the side, so I have to be vigilant. I checked my right side mirror to ensure it was safe.

Speaker 1:
You looked to the left and checked the mirror while passing?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I checked the mirror to see if any cars were approaching from behind. On roads without much traffic, some drivers might speed up and overtake from the left. I need to be aware of that to avoid any surprises, especially when approaching an intersection or a stop.

Speaker 1:
And at that moment, you were just following your usual habit of being cautious?
Speaker 1: He suddenly stopped right in front of me, which gave me quite a scare. The road ahead was a dead end, right? What was the speed limit there?

Speaker 2: Yes, and out of habit, I checked my right rearview mirror.

Speaker 1: And at that moment, you started observing the right side of the road, correct?

Speaker 2: Yes, I glanced to the left and right.

Speaker 1: Then you continued to monitor the right side of the road, just like before, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, I took a quick look, and then slowly, I noticed someone standing there. I looked again and then checked the left side.

Speaker 2: There was a car parked on the side of the road, so I had to move to the right to pass it. I had to cross the center line. This kind of situation is quite dangerous.

Speaker 1: Yes, and there was no way to go on the right side. You had to borrow the main lane.

Speaker 2: When I reached the intersection, there was an electric bike in front of me. I checked the road ahead and saw the pedestrian crossing. You know the one, right? I was about to turn left, and there was a small exit on the right with cars parked on the roadside. I glanced to the left and saw...

Speaker 2: There was a small van in front, and a car parked on the right side. It had been parked there for three trips. I was worried it might open its door because the window was down, so I tried to stay away from it.

Speaker 1: The passenger window and the driver's window?

Speaker 2: Yes, I noticed it on my first trip. I tried to stay close to the center line to avoid it.

Speaker 1: So you always observe the right-side vehicles, even if they are parked, to check for potential dangers like open doors or windows?

Speaker 2: Yes, I try to keep a safe distance, even if the door opens, it won't hit me.

Speaker 1: Got it. Why were you looking at the right-side pedestrian path?

Speaker 2: I wasn't looking at the pedestrian path. There was an exit ahead, and I was checking each exit as I passed.

Speaker 1: Understood. Just now...

Speaker 2: On the way back, an electric bike suddenly came out from one of the exits.

Speaker 1: Was it this exit?

Speaker 2: No, it was another exit. I can't remember if it was the first or second trip, but on the third trip, an electric bike suddenly appeared. I looked to the right and saw no cars coming, so it must have been the electric bike.

Speaker 1: This was on our test road, and it's an important entrance because it doesn't have traffic lights. Do you remember the situation at that time, or how do you usually handle such complex intersections?

Speaker 2: I always slow down when approaching an intersection. I first check the left side, then the right, and then the left again.
Speaker 1:
So, to ensure safety during this drive, what specific areas do you pay extra attention to?

Speaker 2:
I particularly focus on blind spots when turning, especially with electric bikes. Today, we had a lot of turns. Another thing is the parked cars on the roadside; I'm always worried about someone opening a door suddenly. Thirdly, there are those who drive against traffic; every time I turn, I have to watch out for them. And then there's the right turn we made earlier, crossing the non-motorized lane; I had to be very careful there.

Speaker 1:
From where?

Speaker 2:
The first right turn after the U-turn was particularly scary. It's a blind spot, and you can't see it in the mirrors; you have to turn your head to check.

Speaker 1:
How do you feel about your driving?

Speaker 2:
Really? It's okay, no problem. Sorry, it's fine, no worries, I'm here now.

Speaker 1:
Do you agree with the route ahead? I'll confirm it on your computer. We can continue recording as we go. Let's proceed. If I encounter any situations, I'll stop and ask for your input. If there's anything you think I should be aware of, feel free to let me know. Shall we continue? The next part seems to be a right turn.

Speaker 2:
Yes, this kind of situation is particularly dangerous. First, there are many turns here. I need to observe ahead because the light is red on my left. When I reach the turning point, I can't see the left side clearly.

Speaker 1:
So, you first check the traffic lights?

Speaker 2:
Yes, since it's a red light, the cars on the left have stopped. Now, as I move forward, I can't see the left side well because a taxi is blocking the view. The scary part is when you get closer, you can't tell if a car is coming from the left or not, and there are non-motorized vehicles running the red light on the right.

Speaker 1:
In such situations, you can't...

Speaker 2:
You can only stop and turn slowly. If a vehicle is coming, you stop. You just have to keep watching. Look, I keep checking the right side; many are running the red light. They don't care about the traffic rules; even though it's a red light for them, they keep going.

Speaker 1:
So, you...

Speaker 2:
Oh, look at that...
Speaker 1:
He ran a red light. This is a non-motorized vehicle, and he doesn't care about you. We are making a right turn, and normally he should stop at the red light.

Speaker 2:
Oh, you see, he came right up to the line. When he reached the line, he went straight, and I wanted to turn. You have to check the rearview mirror, right? You look at the mirror, but you also need to glance at the window. You have peripheral vision; you don't just stare at the mirror. You keep an eye on it.

Speaker 1:
It's not necessarily what you're looking at.

Speaker 2:
Right, I understand with my peripheral vision.

Speaker 1:
I noticed that in this right turn scenario, the car didn't stop. Why is that?

Speaker 2:
Why? I stopped when I got close to the line to observe. There were no cars coming.

Speaker 1:
But the car was still moving.

Speaker 2:
Yes, the car was moving, but I slowed down when I got close. I wanted to turn, but you see, you can tell at a glance if the other car is going straight. You don't need to worry about it turning. You just need to check its direction. If it looks like it's going straight, it won't turn right. So, I assume it's going straight. I slow down, brake, and turn slowly. If it decides to turn, I can stop. I didn't accelerate; I stopped at the intersection and kept my foot on the brake.

Speaker 1:
But the car was still moving at that time.

Speaker 2:
Yes, the car was moving, but I was braking.

Speaker 1:
When do you need to stop?

Speaker 2:
You need to stop when there's no safe distance between you and the other car.

Speaker 1:
Do you think this situation was safe?

Speaker 2:
Yes, it was safe. He passed, so I slowed down. After he passed, I checked the right side. If there were more people, I would stop and let them pass.

Speaker 1:
I understand that some cars, especially those driven by new drivers, might have stopped completely in this situation. Why did your car keep moving?

Speaker 2:
Because I can stop my car at any time. I maintain a safe distance. If he stops, I can stop too.

Speaker 1:
So, you feel that at your current speed, you can stop at any time.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I can stop at any time. I ensure that if he crosses in front of my car, I won't hit him. If he stops, I can stop immediately.

Speaker 1:
At that moment, what percentage of the accelerator were you pressing?

Speaker 2:
I wasn't pressing the accelerator. If you mean the brake, I was pressing it halfway. The car was moving on its own because it's automatic.
Speaker 2:
I didn't press the accelerator. You said if I brake for three cars, I should press halfway. Now it's halfway, right? Because the car is moving on its own, it's an automatic. If I press the brake fully, it would be too much. When I get closer, you see the current speed, and then the speed at the traffic light, I gradually press down.

Speaker 1:
So now you're braking, already braking.

Speaker 2:
Yes, now it's slightly drifting, no acceleration, I'm already on the brake. My foot is on the brake, but I'm not pressing hard, just a little bit. Honestly, I can't recall exactly, but I should be pressing it. My habit is to always be on the brake and slowly decelerate. I also check the right side, and if there's no reduction in speed, I see if anyone is running a red light. Yes, I slow down, and if a car passes, I continue slowly. It should be around 50%, I feel.

Speaker 1:
When do you start looking for cars?

Speaker 2:
I start looking when a car passes. If there's a pedestrian, I should let them pass. If the pedestrian has just taken a couple of steps, I stop and let them go. I just check the distance between them and my car.

Speaker 1:
How do you decide whether to let them go?

Speaker 2:
If they are far enough, I can turn and go. But if they are close, like just now, I have to let them pass.

Speaker 1:
Do you think the current distance is far?

Speaker 2:
For me, with my driving habits, it's far enough. I wouldn't stop; I would continue. My confidence tells me I can handle it.

Speaker 1:
Yes, you can slowly let the car pass.

Speaker 2:
Yes, slowly let the car pass. When it's close to the end, I press the brake fully. Yes, you can't just press it halfway; you need to press it fully.

Speaker 1:
When do you start accelerating?

Speaker 2:
After turning, I should start accelerating. Yes, my foot is already on the accelerator pedal.

Speaker 1:
Are you afraid of these motor vehicles?

Speaker 2:
Why? Because they might suddenly come up close.

Speaker 1:
Yes.

Speaker 2:
Yes, especially electric bikes. I've encountered many situations where they suddenly turn in front of my car.

Speaker 1:
How do you judge if they will turn?

Speaker 2:
Sometimes I watch them as I get closer. If they are far away, I keep an eye on them. In situations like this, because we need to turn right...
Speaker 1:
Sometimes when I see him riding towards me, I notice him from a distance. I'm on my electric bike, and in situations like this, if we need to turn right ahead, I wouldn't normally be in the middle lane. I wouldn't drive close to the car lights; I generally wouldn't go that way. If I know there's a turn ahead, I usually stay in the lane. I watch how these motor vehicles overtake, and some of them drive very aggressively. When I see a car ahead, I might turn my head slightly. When I get close to him, I rarely overtake.

Speaker 1:
In situations like the one we just discussed, would you prepare to brake?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I would prepare to brake, but I wouldn't release the accelerator completely because I would be checking the left side. If there are no cars on the left and none behind me, I would adjust my direction accordingly.

Speaker 1:
So you wouldn't step on the brake?

Speaker 2:
Right, I would lightly press the brake while still maintaining some acceleration. If you release the accelerator completely, the car, especially an automatic one, will start to decelerate due to engine braking. I would glance to the left to ensure there are no cars, and if someone suddenly comes over, I would adjust my direction. I would place my foot lightly on the brake, but not press it hard. I would judge the angle of the approaching vehicle, and if it crosses the line slightly, I would adjust my position accordingly.

Speaker 1:
So you anticipate their movements?

Speaker 2:
Yes, it's preventive driving.

Speaker 1:
And then you would turn right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I would turn right.

Speaker 1:
But now we're driving straight?

Speaker 2:
Yes, we're driving straight, but you need to watch the intersections on the right. Even if there are no cars, electric bikes can come out quickly. They might not notice the cars.

Speaker 1:
On a straight and smooth road, how do you ensure the car remains stable and comfortable?

Speaker 2:
It's mostly about your own judgment. If there are no obstacles or cars ahead, you can drive a bit faster. However, you need to avoid sudden braking. For example, if I see an intersection ahead and there are no cars, I would maintain my speed. If a car suddenly appears, I would release the accelerator gently to avoid a jerky stop. I would then check for cars and adjust my position slightly, lightly pressing the brake to gradually reduce speed. My foot would hover over the brake, applying slight pressure to ensure a smooth deceleration.

Speaker 1:
So it feels like your foot is just resting on the brake?

Speaker 2:
Yes, just a little bit, but always being mindful.
**Speaker 1:**
When driving, it feels like the car is just floating on the surface, but if you press down a bit, it feels slightly different.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it does feel a bit like that. But in my mind, I always try to anticipate what other cars might do. For example, if a car is about to turn, I need to determine if it's going to let me pass or if it's going to stop. If it doesn't let me pass, I need to gently apply the brakes and proceed cautiously. You can't just drive aggressively on such roads and then suddenly have a car appear out of nowhere, causing a collision. You need to rely on your experience to make these judgments.

**Speaker 2:**
On these roads, it's manageable. But if you're turning right out of our driveway, it's a different story. The road is narrow, and there are often many parked vehicles. Drivers don't always pay attention to cyclists or electric scooters. They assume you will yield to them, so you need to keep a safe distance and be prepared.

**Speaker 1:**
Unlike now, you checked your side mirrors.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I checked my side mirrors to see if there were any fast-approaching electric scooters. My speed wasn't fast, but I needed to see if there were any vehicles coming up quickly. I was about to make a turn.

**Speaker 1:**
Why do you check?

**Speaker 2:**
It's a habit to quickly glance at the side mirrors. It's not that I constantly stare at them. When I was learning to drive, my instructor taught me to use peripheral vision. You don't need to focus intently; a quick glance is enough to see if there's any traffic.

**Speaker 1:**
Next, you were about to make a right turn.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I checked the mirrors and then looked ahead to see if there were any pedestrians or oncoming traffic.

**Speaker 1:**
Were you worried about the car at the entrance?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but it was far enough away. If it had been closer to the center line, I would have been more concerned and would have applied the brakes gently, not abruptly, while assessing its speed and direction.

**Speaker 1:**
In situations like the right turn you just mentioned, how do you maintain control?

**Speaker 2:**
You need to slow down as you approach the turn. It's essential to reduce speed at intersections. If you're going too fast, you'll need to brake suddenly, which isn't ideal. So, it's better to slow down gradually as you approach the turn.
Speaker 1:
You need to follow the rules. When you turn, you should slow down. If you're going too fast, you'll have to brake suddenly, which is unnecessary. Instead, ease off the gas and anticipate the situation. Check your mirrors to see if there are any electric bikes or motorcycles approaching quickly. Also, watch out for pedestrians, especially at crosswalks. Even if you're going slowly, you can't just turn quickly.

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. I'm not worried about the cars parked on the left.

Speaker 1:
I'm more concerned about the car in the middle. When it turns, it crosses the center line because there are parked cars on the side, so you need to give it some space. I'm also worried about the car on the right. It's signaling to make a U-turn, but you don't know when it will actually turn. It might be waiting for you, but you can't be sure, so you have to proceed cautiously. The car's wheels moved slightly forward, indicating it might turn soon.

Speaker 1:
So, you judge based on the car's wheels?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I first look at the turn signal, then see if the wheels move. When they do, I stop. I saw a white shirt pass by, so I moved slightly to the left.

Speaker 1:
At that moment, you were already turning left?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I turned left because I saw the car moving slightly to the left. This way, it wouldn't try to make a sudden U-turn, and I was also driving slowly.

Speaker 1:
There were also bicycles around. Can you describe the situation at the intersection?

Speaker 2:
After turning, I first checked the car on the right, which moved slightly and signaled a right turn, then a left turn. I anticipated it might make a U-turn or move forward. Then, a car approached from the opposite direction, so I had to give it space to pass. Once it passed, I moved to the left. An experienced driver wouldn't make a U-turn at that point; they would have started turning earlier. It seemed like the car wasn't planning to move forward but was waiting for a chance to turn.

Speaker 1:
So, you thought it was going to turn, and you needed to share the lane?

Speaker 2:
Yes, when I turned, I saw the two cars. Honestly, I didn't feel they posed much danger because they were driving normally. Neither of them was veering left or right.
**Speaker 1:**
I didn't feel there was much danger because both of them were driving normally. I saw them riding quite normally. They weren't veering to the left or right, and there were no intersections on the right. If there had been an intersection on the right and they were looking that way, I might have been a bit worried. But fortunately, when I passed by, I saw that they were both driving normally. The one in blue just glanced to the right, but he didn't suddenly turn when I got close.

**Speaker 2:**
So, people are still very mindful of pedestrians here.

**Speaker 1:**
You have to anticipate their movements. You need to watch the direction they're looking to predict their actions.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, if there was an intersection.

**Speaker 1:**
Then it would be a bit concerning.

**Speaker 2:**
If there was an intersection and he suddenly turned and hit me, I would have to take evasive action. If he doesn't look at the car, there's nothing I can do. If I’m already there and he suddenly turns, it would be my responsibility if an accident happened. The traffic police would definitely hold me accountable.

**Speaker 1:**
But there was a car signaling, wasn't there?

**Speaker 2:**
I wasn't worried about the signaling car because I was in my own lane. Unless he suddenly swerved, I wasn't going too slow either. If he was signaling, it means he was also observing the situation. So, I wasn't too concerned.

**Speaker 1:**
I saw you glance at that area.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I glanced to check if there were any cars coming out of that intersection because we were about to make a right turn. I know that area well. Did you see any cars coming out?

**Speaker 1:**
No, I didn't see any cars.

**Speaker 2:**
I was checking the intersection. The distance was manageable. I know this road well and where to turn. We used to turn left from here, so I know the right side is tricky. Sometimes cars sneak up from there. It's a blind spot. After I turned, a MINI followed us. It seemed to be following our path.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you notice that car?

**Speaker 2:**
There wasn't much of an issue with that car. I anticipated its movement. It stayed in its lane because it was turning left. I kept a safe distance and wasn't too worried. Next, there's a right turn. I saw another car coming out without signaling. I just glanced at it and then checked the right side again.
**Speaker 1:**
You mentioned a right turn earlier. Can you describe what happened? It seemed like a narrow turn. How did you manage it? Was the car safe?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the first thing I did was to slow down. Based on my driving experience, I adjusted the steering angle accordingly. It's all about knowing how much to turn the wheel to make the turn smoothly.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you determine how much to turn the wheel and at what speed?

**Speaker 2:**
Well, I don't drive fast in such situations. I adjust the steering while moving slowly. I make sure to leave enough space on the right side because there's a bike lane, and I want to avoid any oncoming cyclists. I keep my car within the lane and ensure the front left wheel doesn't cross the yellow line. Once I make the turn without crossing the line, I straighten the wheel gradually and continue driving. The car handles it well, and there's no issue with the vehicle.

**Speaker 1:**
What about the other driver?

**Speaker 2:**
The other driver didn't seem to notice me. If he had, I wouldn't have been worried. The concern is if he suddenly changes direction. In such cases, I need to be decisive and sometimes accelerate to avoid any potential collision. For instance, I was cautious at an intersection because a moped suddenly appeared. I always keep an eye on intersections to avoid surprises like that.

**Speaker 1:**
What was the moped rider doing?

**Speaker 2:**
He was turning into my lane and then going straight. He came out of nowhere from the intersection.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you note the exact moment this happened?

**Speaker 2:**
Sure, I can mark it. It was right after we passed that spot. You can see it on the red line below.
**Speaker 1:**
Can you help me note this moment? I want to mark it. Okay, I want to click on it, past that place. Click on the red line below, not above. The red line. Okay, just ahead, right here, yes, right here by the black car, right?

**Speaker 2:**
The van.

**Speaker 1:**
So, your method to avoid it was to steer the car to the left.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, if a door opens, I avoid getting too close to it. I make sure to leave enough space for a car door to open. If someone opens the door, I want to ensure they can't hit my car.

**Speaker 1:**
At that moment, did you brake or accelerate?

**Speaker 2:**
Honestly, I can't remember exactly. I think I might not have braked. Maybe I just eased off the gas a bit. I can't recall this part clearly.

**Speaker 1:**
What did you do after the car came out?

**Speaker 2:**
After it came out, I instinctively eased off the gas. When I saw it turning, I steered back to the right. I was cautious, watching to see if another car would come out. I kept an eye on it.

**Speaker 1:**
You checked the left side.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, there was a car on the left. I saw it. But at that moment, I was in my own lane.

**Speaker 1:**
The road conditions were quite complex. Just like now, after that car passed, I saw you checking the right intersection, but there was also a car on the left.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the car on the left was going straight. I assumed it wouldn't turn, so I returned to my lane. I was cautious but confident in my judgment.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you judged that it wouldn't turn left.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I judged it in advance. I saw it was going straight without slowing down.

**Speaker 1:**
If it were to turn, it would likely slow down and check your side.

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly, it would look in my direction or slow down. But it had already passed the intersection, so I quickly glanced and moved on. I don't stare for too long.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you worry about the cars here?

**Speaker 2:**
These two cars? Not really. I'm more concerned about electric bikes coming from behind them because of the blind spots. But as long as I'm in my lane, I don't worry too much. If there were cars on the right too...
**Speaker 1:**
I was worried that an electric bike might come out from behind because there are still blind spots. But I was driving in my own lane, so I wouldn't do that if there were cars on the right and another car coming from the opposite direction. If I were to cross the center line, I would keep my speed low. Sometimes, I might even lightly tap the brakes to ensure I can stop the car in an emergency.

**Speaker 2:**
I'm quite curious about this. On roads with many intersections, you never know when a car might come out. Secondly, if both sides are filled with parked cars, blocking your blind spots, how do you maintain a smooth and comfortable speed? From what you said, it seems like you wouldn't constantly be on the brakes. Wouldn't the car jerk if you keep braking and accelerating?

**Speaker 1:**
The key to braking and accelerating is that your speed shouldn't be too high. It really depends on your speed. For example, if you're driving at 100 km/h and suddenly release the accelerator, the engine braking will help slow you down. The feeling in the car is different compared to when you're driving at 60 km/h and release the accelerator. If you're driving at 100 km/h and suddenly brake, it will be a hard stop. But if you're driving at 60 km/h or 30 km/h on such roads, you definitely won't be going 60 km/h.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, here you would be driving at most 30 km/h.

**Speaker 1:**
Exactly. If you're driving at 30 or 40 km/h and you brake, the car will just jerk a little. But if you're driving at 100 or 60 km/h and suddenly brake, the jerking will be more pronounced. At 30 km/h, a brake will cause a small jerk, but at 60 or 100 km/h, it will be more significant. 

**Speaker 2:**
So on such roads, frequently alternating between braking and accelerating doesn't really matter.

**Speaker 1:**
Right, the idea of braking here isn't to press down hard. At 30 km/h, you're already going slow, so just releasing the accelerator and keeping your foot ready on the brake is a precaution. If something happens, you can brake immediately. You need to be confident in your ability to stop the car based on your judgment. If you brake and still get hit, there's nothing you can do about it. It's all about anticipation.

**Speaker 2:**
So you anticipate the situation.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, to be honest, it's a bit tricky because with electric bikes, you never know when they might suddenly turn without checking their mirrors. Look at that opening on the left; many times, they just come out of nowhere. That's why I stay close to the yellow line when there's no oncoming traffic, as it's a dashed line.
Speaker 1:
So, you quickly turned around. You see that opening on the left? Many times, it's like this. You didn't notice, but I was still on the yellow line. Because there were no cars coming from the opposite direction, I took the opportunity. It's a dashed line, you know, so I borrowed a lane to keep a safe distance. If there were cars coming from the opposite direction, I would slow down a bit and stay closer to my lane.

Speaker 2:
Right, if there are no cars coming from the opposite direction, you can take the opportunity. But if there are cars, you have to be more cautious.

Speaker 1:
Exactly, in complex road situations like this, if the road is wider, I wouldn't stick close to the other car. I would use the leftmost lane to keep a safe distance.

Speaker 2:
How did you judge that just now? Like the car on the right, how did you know it wouldn't turn left?

Speaker 1:
It's mostly based on intuition and experience. I didn't think it would turn because the rider didn't show any signs. Generally, if a person or a vehicle is going to turn, there are always some indications.

Speaker 2:
For example?

Speaker 1:
For instance, people riding electric bikes often give subtle hints. If they want to turn, they might tilt their head slightly. When you see that, you should slow down and keep a safe distance.

Speaker 2:
So, if their head tilts, they might be planning to turn?

Speaker 1:
Yes, if there's an opening ahead and they tilt their head slightly, you should be cautious and slow down.

Speaker 2:
Exactly, even with cars, if you're following one and it approaches an opening without signaling, but starts to slow down or slightly veer, you should keep your distance. If there's a lane on the left, use it. If not, just keep a safe distance to allow them to turn or stop. They might be unfamiliar with the road and looking for directions.

Speaker 1:
So, you judge based on their speed and slight movements of the wheels?

Speaker 2:
Yes, honestly, I'm always wary of vehicles going the wrong way. If they are bold enough to go against traffic, they usually won't crash into you. But still, I keep my distance.

Speaker 1:
So, if they are going the wrong way, you think they won't crash into you?

Speaker 2:
Generally, they won't. If they do, there's not much you can do. If they are going the wrong way and still crash into you, it's unavoidable. You just have to let them pass.

Speaker 1:
In situations like this, do you get nervous?

Speaker 2:
Sometimes, yes. I'm cautious about cars coming from the front, especially if there are electric bikes. But usually, it's manageable.
**Speaker 1:**
In this scenario, do you feel scared when there are vehicles on both sides?

**Speaker 2:**
Sometimes, yes. I'm particularly worried about vehicles suddenly appearing from the front, especially electric bikes. Generally, they don't just pop out unexpectedly because I keep an eye on them from a distance. They usually stick to their lane and don't come too close, but there's always a risk of them suddenly appearing from a blind spot.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you're saying that this car...

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, with this car, you can usually see the electric bikes as they pass by. Normally, they stay in their lane, and you can spot them from a distance.

**Speaker 1:**
Right, they usually stick to their lane and don't come too close, correct?

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly. People don't just suddenly run out. If someone does appear, it's usually a quick, unexpected move.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you handle such situations?

**Speaker 2:**
In these situations, I usually...

**Speaker 1:**
Do you stay in the middle, or do you move to the right? What's your approach?

**Speaker 2:**
In such scenarios, I tend to move slightly to the right. However, if there are bicycles or electric bikes on the right, I can't get too close to them. I try to stay near the center line without crossing it.

**Speaker 1:**
So, compared to pedestrians, you might be more concerned about vehicles blocking your view?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. The blind spots are a major concern.

**Speaker 1:**
And there's another car here.

**Speaker 2:**
That's not a problem. Those cars are driving normally.

**Speaker 1:**
Now, let's talk about making a left turn at an intersection without traffic lights. Can you describe what you did in that situation?

**Speaker 2:**
As I approached the intersection, I slowed down and kept my foot near the brake. I turned on the indicator and first checked the right side. Then, I looked to the left. I know that many vehicles, especially electric bikes, tend to cut corners and come from the right. So, I checked the right side first, then the left. If the left side was clear, I checked the right side again to ensure there were no vehicles, and then I made the turn.

**Speaker 1:**
So, your sequence for making a left turn is to first check for any oncoming traffic from the right, then see if it's safe to turn left?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I make sure there are no vehicles, electric bikes, or pedestrians coming from the left. Once it's safe, I check the right side again and then make the turn.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it.
Speaker 1:
Let's look at the main road on the right.

Speaker 2:
I checked the left side, and it was clear for a long distance, so I could make the turn. There were no cars on the left. I quickly glanced straight ahead, and there were no cars either.

Speaker 1:
Got it. So, you made the turn. What about now, in this situation, ahead of us?

Speaker 2:
At that moment, I slowed down. I saw him coming, so I reduced my speed. Did I brake? I think I did. Yes, I slowed down, and after he passed, he went back to his lane. I had to yield to him; otherwise, we could have collided.

Speaker 1:
Did you accelerate at this point?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I accelerated after making the turn. I understood the situation.

Speaker 1:
At this moment, are you afraid of this car?

Speaker 2:
Not really. Why? Because I believe he has seen me, and he knows he won't turn left. His speed hasn't decreased either. Many delivery vehicles tend to turn suddenly. If he had seen me, he would have slowed down to let me go first. If he tried to cut in front of me, he would have done it quickly. But now, he seems to be going straight. So, if he turns, I will steer accordingly. There are no cars coming from the opposite direction right now.

Speaker 1:
So, you would brake and yield?

Speaker 2:
Yes, exactly. I would steer and honk while turning.

Speaker 1:
Should you honk in this situation?

Speaker 2:
Yes, there's no other way.

Speaker 1:
Next, we should follow the traffic lights. This road is quite spacious. Are there any scenarios you are afraid of?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I'm afraid of electric bikes running red lights.

Speaker 1:
From the south side?

Speaker 2:
From either the left or right side.

Speaker 1:
And also cars driving against traffic?

Speaker 2:
Yes, some cars drive against traffic, and some run red lights. It's not always clear if a car coming from the left is driving against traffic. I'm worried about cars running red lights at intersections.

Speaker 1:
You checked both sides?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I took a quick look, and there were no cars on the road.

Speaker 1:
This road is quite spacious. Are you afraid of cars here?

Speaker 2:
I'm not afraid of these cars, but I'm worried about sudden appearances, like an electric bike suddenly coming out. I didn't accelerate; I just maintained a steady speed.

Speaker 1:
Are you afraid of intersections?

Speaker 2:
Yes, intersections are my main concern. Some intersections have short visibility, and you can only see the traffic when you are very close. Others have long visibility, and you can see vehicles from a distance and slow down accordingly. For situations like this, I also slow down a bit.
At some intersections, you can only see what's coming when you're right up close, while at others, you can see from a distance and start slowing down if you spot an electric bike coming out. In such cases, I make sure I can either avoid the vehicle or stop to let it pass. Up ahead, there's a woman.

Where? Just up ahead.

See that woman? She's coming out. Do you see her?

The intersection is sudden.

It's okay if a car comes out. Do you see it?

How do you judge what she intends to do at this moment?

Right now, I just know that whether she crosses the road or not, she definitely wants to overtake the car in front of her.

Why do you think so?

Because she's veering, and her speed is faster than the car in front. She's veering towards this direction.

So, you compare her direction and her speed with the car in front.

Yes, her speed is faster, so she might want to overtake.

It's not just overtaking; she might be turning left. So, I slowed down and followed her.

When did you start to slow down? You told me to stop.

When I saw her coming out, I started to slow down. I didn't dare to go fast anymore; I eased off the gas.

How many meters away was that? 

About twenty or thirty meters. Because our paths were about to intersect, I was going straight, and she was coming from the same direction.

Is she on the same road as you?

Yes, exactly. I could stop if needed, so I just followed her.

Are you afraid of that trash bag?

No, I'm not afraid because I know I won't hit it. I thought she was going to turn, so I didn't steer towards it. Look at the old lady, she's not scared at all.

At this moment, what can you do?

I can only keep my foot near the brake. If she slows down, I'll slow down too, but she won't stop because she saw me. Did you see that?

Why do you think she looked at you?

She didn't know there was a car behind her. She looked back to check, and since there was no horn or anything, she just went ahead. She looked at me, and then she didn't turn back. So, she wasn't scared. If she's not scared, I'll just wait and follow her slowly.

When you noticed she looked at you, what did you do?

I had already started to slow down and brake gently. I kept reducing my speed, and when I saw she was definitely going to cross the road, I moved to the right.
Slowing down with a light brake, I've already reduced the speed. I'm braking gradually, coming to a stop. Slowly, you see, as I slow down, it passes. I saw it was definitely going to cross the road, so I moved to the right. I followed to the right, avoiding it, and it avoided me too. You see, it went against the traffic.

Speaker 1:
Once it sees you, you can continue to accelerate.

Speaker 2:
Yes, but you still need to keep a distance from it and reduce your speed. If it sees you and follows the rules, you need to judge whether it will let you pass or if it intends to turn. In these two situations, I can overtake it because it saw me and moved back, indicating it might let me pass or it needs to turn right into its lane.

Speaker 1:
So, once it sees you, you can start judging its intentions and movements.

Speaker 2:
Yes, initially, when it didn't see me, it was riding. I judged two situations: one, it might turn right back into its lane, or two, it might turn left. After it saw me and didn't react, I felt assured and continued on my way.

Speaker 1:
From the moment it saw you, you couldn't tell what it was thinking.

Speaker 2:
It didn't have its turn signal on.

Speaker 1:
Were you still watching it at that time?

Speaker 2:
No, I was watching the oncoming traffic.

Speaker 1:
Were you looking at the side road or the main road?

Speaker 2:
The side road.

Speaker 1:
You should first watch the side road and let the vehicles pass. You see, this electric bike didn't slow down at the pedestrian crossing, and there was no one there. Now, I'm looking far ahead at the car tops to see if any cars are coming. Based on that, I'll decide whether to brake or stop.

Speaker 1:
And it was approaching quite fast.

Speaker 2:
Yes, but there were no cars far away. Seeing the car's speed, I didn't turn that way. I stayed in this lane to let it overtake. After it overtakes, I'll turn left. You see, another car is coming. I'm following the car in front, which is making a U-turn.

Speaker 1:
In situations like the one just now, when being overtaken, can you describe how you maintain a smooth, comfortable, and safe drive?

Speaker 2:
First, after you turn, check the distance from the car in front, which is moving continuously.

Speaker 1:
Which car are you referring to?

Speaker 2:
The black one that turned. I thought you were in this lane. First, check the rearview mirror for fast-approaching cars. I could change lanes by accelerating quickly, but to ensure passenger comfort, you shouldn't do that. You need to match the speed of the car in front after turning.
Speaker 1:
So, you just change lanes, but if you want to ensure the comfort of the passengers, you can't do it abruptly. You need to check the speed of the car in front. After you switch lanes, your speed shouldn't be too fast. You should gently accelerate a bit. Then, you need to maintain a certain speed because I know that in a few meters, I need to make a U-turn. I have a mental gauge for this. I let the cars pass first, then I signal, and after they pass, I maintain my speed, not too fast. After these two cars pass, I keep a steady speed and approach slowly. When I see the traffic light ahead, I start to decelerate. As I get closer, I gently press the brake.

Speaker 1:
Got it. How did you decide whether to let one car pass or two?

Speaker 2:
I only decided to let one car pass. After that car passed, I checked again.

Speaker 1:
And then there was another car.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I checked again. If there were still many cars approaching, I would slow down in advance and let all the cars pass. After signaling, I let all the cars pass before making the U-turn.

Speaker 1:
And then you had to merge into the auxiliary road.

Speaker 2:
Yes, but there was a red light for the left turn. Based on my experience, it's usually fine to turn onto the main road. However, I'm not familiar with this area, so I wasn't sure if I could directly turn onto the auxiliary road. The navigation system said I could, so I decided to turn. But it wasn't convenient because there was a left turn, and many right turns, and many electric bikes going the wrong way on the auxiliary road. It was very complicated. So, I kept checking and let all the cars pass. There were also many electric bikes going the wrong way.

Speaker 2:
Yes, after letting all the cars pass, I finally made the U-turn. But there were still many cars, making it difficult to turn. In such situations, I usually wait for the traffic light to turn green. I don't mind waiting a minute or two. It's safer to wait for the green light. Also, by waiting, I don't violate any traffic rules, and it allows the cars behind me to make their U-turns more smoothly.
Speaker 1:
You didn't violate any regulations, right? Secondly, there were many cars behind you, and someone wanted to make a U-turn on the main road. You could have moved forward a bit to let the cars behind you pass, allowing the other driver to make the U-turn without waiting for you. When I was making the U-turn, I followed all the regulations.

Speaker 2:
Yes, that's correct. At that time, I shifted to neutral.

Speaker 1:
Why did you shift to neutral?

Speaker 2:
To be honest, in situations where you have to wait for a long time, like at a red light, it's a habit to shift to neutral in an automatic car. If you don't, the engine keeps working hard even though you're pressing the brake. This can be tough on the transmission gears. It's a personal habit, and it's how we were taught at my workplace. If the light is about to change in a few seconds, I don't shift to neutral. But if it's just turned red, I do.

Speaker 1:
In such situations, how do you decide when to proceed? Like today, for instance.

Speaker 2:
I try to let as many cars pass as possible. I look for those following traffic rules and wait for a gap to make my turn.

Speaker 1:
How do you judge when it's safe to go? In theory, if there are many people and cars, they won't stop.

Speaker 2:
Exactly. So, I watch the traffic flow. If there are no cars coming from the other side, I make my turn. I also check to ensure I'm not obstructing anyone. Once I see it's clear, I proceed. For example, if there's a large vehicle coming, I let it pass first since it's making a right turn and I'm making a U-turn.

Speaker 1:
So, in terms of right of way, you have the least priority.

Speaker 2:
Yes, I must not obstruct others. I let the cars making left turns pass first.

Speaker 1:
So, you weren't looking at the pedestrian crossing but at the left-turning cars.

Speaker 2:
Yes, because the pedestrian crossing had a red light, and there were no pedestrians. I checked for electric bikes as well. Once I saw it was clear, I made my U-turn.
**Speaker 1:**
Did you see that? Over there, I can make a U-turn. So now, I'm making a U-turn, and there's no one around, not even electric bikes. Look, all the cars parked over there are going the wrong way. Do you see that? Yes, I was watching that electric bike coming towards me. The rider saw me too and stopped.

**Speaker 2:**
I have a question for you. In this situation, when you were making a left turn onto the side road, why didn't you check the right side?

**Speaker 1:**
Because there were no cars coming from the right. Before making the U-turn, I glanced over. The first pedestrian crossing was clear because I was definitely faster than any pedestrian. The second, the electric bike couldn't get through because it was going the wrong way and couldn't catch up with me. Since I was making a normal U-turn, if he had hit me, it would have been his fault. Understand? There's nothing I could do about it.

**Speaker 2:**
You mentioned that the bike rider saw you?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, he saw me. We made eye contact.

**Speaker 2:**
What do you mean by "he saw you"?

**Speaker 1:**
He saw my car making the U-turn. He initially wanted to push forward, but then he stopped. After he stopped, I slowed down a bit to let him pass, but I could still go through. He wanted to move forward but stopped when he saw me.

**Speaker 2:**
So, he stopped after seeing you?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, he saw me making the U-turn. I knew he was going the wrong way, so he stopped, and I could pass. I glanced at him, and he saw my car making the turn.

**Speaker 2:**
What about those students on the right side?

**Speaker 1:**
They were just standing there, chatting.

**Speaker 2:**
Do you think the distance between the cars is close?

**Speaker 1:**
The distance is okay, not too close. I made sure to leave enough space, and they weren't moving because they were waiting for the light to change. They should have started moving when I made the U-turn.

**Speaker 2:**
Got it.

**Speaker 1:**
Look at that car over there. See the bicycle? The rider was far away and saw me. The elderly woman on the bike was riding slowly, so I decided to go first. The car parked there made it clear that it was going to move left.

**Speaker 2:**
When did you decide to overtake?

**Speaker 1:**
I was already prepared to go because I knew I could pass safely.

**Speaker 2:**
So, you decided to overtake at that moment?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes.
**Speaker 1:**
Are you planning to overtake him?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, my current speed is already set to overtake him. I’m confident I can pass him.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you’ve decided to overtake him now?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I’ve decided. Did I overtake him? Yes, I did. I quickly accelerated a bit.

**Speaker 1:**
Look at the car on this side.

**Speaker 2:**
The car on this side? In this situation, I’m not worried because I know he won’t open his door and hit my car. I’m keeping to the left as much as possible to avoid any potential door openings.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you judge this car?

**Speaker 2:**
Judge this car?

**Speaker 1:**
Why?

**Speaker 2:**
This car is driven by an elderly man on a small electric vehicle. He can ride wherever he wants. He knows what he’s doing.

**Speaker 1:**
What is he trying to do now?

**Speaker 2:**
He’s just going straight, but you need to watch the road ahead. There’s oncoming traffic. See if he moves back. If he does, you need to slow down a bit when you turn and watch his speed.

**Speaker 1:**
He hasn’t...

**Speaker 2:**
If he keeps riding like this, just stay behind him. We’re about to turn, so don’t bother him. Just slow down and proceed carefully.

**Speaker 1:**
What about these types of vehicles?

**Speaker 2:**
Are you worried about delivery vehicles like Flash Express or food delivery bikes? Not just these vehicles, but I always keep an eye on them. Look at this car; I anticipated its move because it slowed down. Which car? The electric vehicle in the rearview mirror. It slowed down because I had already signaled. When it saw my signal, it understood and adjusted accordingly.

**Speaker 1:**
Okay. The video should stop here. Do you have any additional questions about the video? No? Alright. We have a few more questions that might be related to the video or other topics. You can also refer to the situations we just discussed. One question is, to ensure safety during this drive, what specific precautions did you take?

**Speaker 2:**
I paid special attention to electric vehicles, pedestrians, and oncoming traffic when turning.

**Speaker 1:**
Why?

**Speaker 2:**
Because they are prone to accidents. I can anticipate and prevent issues, but sometimes they can’t, like running red lights or going against traffic. When turning, you must yield to straight-going vehicles. Many electric vehicles are very fast now. I can avoid them, but they might not avoid me, leading to collisions or sudden stops. Also, I paid attention to illegally parked vehicles on the roadside.
**Speaker 1:**
Can you prevent it? We might crash or stop, and then there's also the issue of illegally parked cars on the roadside. The biggest concern is the "door crash" when someone suddenly opens their car door. We might hit them.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, illegally parked cars. Is there anything else you particularly focus on?

**Speaker 1:**
Another concern is blind spots. For example, when turning from a main road onto a side road, you can't see non-motorized vehicles on the side road. You have to make a wide turn and carefully slow down to check. This is something I worry about.

**Speaker 2:**
When exactly do you encounter this after making a U-turn?

**Speaker 1:**
Right after the U-turn, when we start to come out. After the U-turn, we make a right turn, but we can't see the bike lane because of the greenery.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it blocks the view.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you try to look ahead?

**Speaker 2:**
I try to look ahead as much as possible, unless I'm unfamiliar with the road. If I suddenly realize there's a turn ahead, I'll slow down and look carefully.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it. How do you think one can drive more safely?

**Speaker 2:**
Drive slowly whenever possible. It's not a one-size-fits-all solution; you need to observe carefully and anticipate. Preventive driving is key—anticipate and slow down.

**Speaker 1:**
But if you keep slowing down to anticipate, won't the car keep stopping and going?

**Speaker 2:**
It depends on the traffic conditions. During peak hours, you start and stop frequently anyway, and your speed isn't fast. In situations like today, you need to anticipate to ensure your speed isn't too fast. On city roads, you can't go fast anyway. On highways with speed limits of 80 or 100, you can drive at a steady speed if there's no traffic. But if there are more cars, you'll naturally slow down based on the traffic flow.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you also judge based on traffic flow, right? Can you recall any specific alerts or warnings you pay attention to while driving? Are there any situations that particularly scare you, even with your 20+ years of driving experience?

**Speaker 2:**
What really scares me are the situations we discussed earlier—illegally parked cars on the roadside and blind spots. For example, if there's a car parked illegally, I can't see if someone or a bike might suddenly appear in front of it. Or at intersections, someone might suddenly cross the road.
Speaker 1: So, what do you do when there are blind spots, like when you can't see in front of the car and someone or an electric bike suddenly appears, or at intersections where people, including children, might suddenly run out?

Speaker 2: In such cases, you must always slow down when approaching intersections. It's essential to reduce speed at intersections to be prepared for any sudden appearances.

Speaker 1: But what about situations like the one we just encountered, where there are cars all along the right side? Do you always have to slow down?

Speaker 2: In those situations, you should maintain a steady speed, around 20-30 km/h, so that you can stop quickly if something unexpected happens.

Speaker 1: What speed do you think is safe for those kinds of roads to ensure you can stop at any time?

Speaker 2: I was driving around 30 km/h earlier, which I think is a safe speed. Going faster, like 40-50 km/h, can be dangerous because it might be harder to stop in time, and it could be uncomfortable for passengers.

Speaker 1: So, you think a bit over 30 km/h is a safe speed?

Speaker 2: Yes, just over 30 km/h is safe, especially on roads with a lot of traffic.

Speaker 1: What are some of your bad driving habits that might be dangerous?

Speaker 2: Sometimes, I tend to drive too close to the car in front, especially on ring roads or highways when the car ahead is moving slowly. If the speed limit is 100 km/h and the car in front is going 80 km/h, I might follow too closely and then quickly change lanes to overtake. This habit of tailgating and sudden lane changes can be dangerous.

Speaker 1: Do you have any bad habits on roads like the one we drove on today?

Speaker 2: On such roads, I tend to be overconfident in my ability to predict situations. While I try to anticipate potential issues, being too confident can be a bad habit because I can't always predict everything accurately.

Speaker 1: What about when you're a passenger in someone else's car?
Speaker 1:
Do you think you are a confident driver?

Speaker 2:
Yes, but I wouldn't say I'm overly confident. I try to be cautious.

Speaker 1:
When you're a passenger in someone else's car, what driving behaviors make you feel unsafe or anxious?

Speaker 2:
Honestly, it's often the speed. Sometimes the driver goes too fast and follows other cars too closely. It makes me feel uneasy.

Speaker 1:
So, you feel unsafe when the driver is speeding and tailgating?

Speaker 2:
Yes, it feels dangerous. Also, when they don't slow down in advance. For example, they see a red light ahead but still accelerate until the last moment before braking.

Speaker 1:
Not slowing down in advance for traffic lights?

Speaker 2:
Yes, or when they see traffic congestion ahead.

Speaker 1:
I understand. Did you notice that your passengers today seemed comfortable? They didn't use the hand signal for discomfort. It seems like you drove quite smoothly today. Do you usually pay attention to your passengers' comfort?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I do.

Speaker 1:
In what ways do you ensure their comfort?

Speaker 2:
If I'm not in a hurry, I make sure to drive at a moderate speed. Even if I need to speed up, I avoid sudden braking. I start slowing down well in advance when I see a red light. I try to make the ride as smooth as possible, avoiding sudden starts and stops.

Speaker 1:
Do you always pay attention to your passengers' comfort, even when driving important passengers or leaders?

Speaker 2:
Yes, generally, they never complain. They never say my driving is too rough or that they feel dizzy. They seem to be comfortable with my driving style.

Speaker 1:
Do you think you have any bad driving habits that might make your passengers uncomfortable?

Speaker 2:
Sometimes, if I'm in a hurry for a meeting, I might accelerate quickly or change lanes abruptly. This can happen in heavy traffic when I see an opening and try to take it quickly.

Speaker 1:
So, you think sudden acceleration and lane changes might make your passengers uncomfortable?
**Speaker 1:**
When you're stuck in traffic and see an opening, you quickly accelerate and change lanes. Sometimes you follow closely behind other cars.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I think sudden acceleration and following closely can make passengers uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you believe that frequent lane changes can also be uncomfortable for passengers, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, definitely. If the traffic isn't heavy, you can signal and change lanes slowly. But if you're in a hurry, you might change lanes quickly, which can be uncomfortable. On the highway, sudden lane changes are also uncomfortable. It's better to change lanes gradually.

**Speaker 1:**
When you ride in someone else's car, what driving habits make you feel uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Sometimes the driving is too aggressive.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you mean by aggressive?

**Speaker 2:**
Sudden acceleration, quick starts, and not slowing down when approaching a red light or traffic jam. It makes me feel tense and uncomfortable. Sudden braking also contributes to this discomfort.

**Speaker 1:**
Are these habits similar to your own driving habits?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, somewhat.

**Speaker 1:**
Considering passenger comfort, what aspects did you pay special attention to during your driving today?

**Speaker 2:**
I tried to ensure a smooth ride for the passengers. For example, I avoided sudden accelerations and braking. I drove normally, as I usually do, but with extra attention to passenger comfort. On highways, the speed is different, but today I focused on making the ride as comfortable as possible.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you have any sudden braking or acceleration today?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I don't think so. Maybe one or two instances of sudden braking, but overall, I tried to drive smoothly.
Speaker 1:
Did you brake suddenly? Accelerate quickly?

Speaker 2:
I was in a hurry today. I think I might have braked once or twice suddenly. If it was an emergency brake, it might have been just once or not at all. I felt like I was driving normally today.

Speaker 1:
When you usually drive, especially when carrying important passengers, do you often brake or accelerate suddenly like today? Or do they not mind?

Speaker 2:
Normally, I wouldn't do that. It depends on the traffic situation. If it's congested, you can't just take your time. When the traffic clears up, you need to keep up with the flow. But in general, unless there's a special situation, I don't brake or accelerate suddenly.

Speaker 1:
How do you think you can make the ride more comfortable for passengers, especially on their first day?

Speaker 2:
I think maintaining a steady speed is key.

Speaker 1:
What do you mean by a steady speed?

Speaker 2:
It means adjusting your speed according to the road conditions. For example, if the road is clear, you can drive a bit faster. On the highway, if the speed limit is 120 km/h and there are no cars, you can drive at 80 or 100 km/h. But if there are many cars, you need to slow down. You can't just drive at 120 km/h and then suddenly brake when you see traffic ahead.

Speaker 1:
How did you handle the sections today where there were many parked cars on the right?

Speaker 2:
I think I slowed down by about 80%. I eased off the accelerator a bit in those areas.

Speaker 1:
What do you think makes a good driver or a highly professional one? What are your standards?

Speaker 2:
For a professional driver, the first thing is to have a sense of time. Being punctual is crucial. Secondly, you need to be familiar with your vehicle's performance and check it regularly. You need to know your car well.

Speaker 1:
If we focus on specific driving operations, what do you think are the key aspects for a driver?
Speaker 1:
When it comes to driving, what are the key things to check and be aware of, especially if you drive frequently?

Speaker 2:
First and foremost, always follow traffic laws, no matter the situation. Secondly, maintain a safe and consistent speed. This doesn't just mean avoiding speeding; it also means driving with a sense of respect and caution, especially in heavy traffic or on highways. You need to be mindful of your speed and avoid sudden accelerations or harsh braking to take care of your vehicle.

Speaker 2:
Another important aspect is developing good driving habits. For instance, always use your turn signals when changing lanes or making turns. This is a basic rule that every driver should follow. Additionally, be mindful of where you park; avoid illegal parking and always check your mirrors before stopping. It's crucial to stay calm and composed while driving. I remember when I was younger, I used to drive recklessly, but over time, I learned to cultivate better habits and a more patient attitude.

Speaker 1:
What are the benefits of staying calm while driving?

Speaker 2:
Staying calm helps you remain composed and make better decisions. It prevents you from engaging in road rage or aggressive driving, which can be dangerous.

Speaker 1:
Regarding professional driving standards, how would you assess if someone is a professional driver?

Speaker 2:
I would look at their driving habits. Do they use turn signals when changing lanes or making turns? Do they frequently check their mirrors? Are they aware of pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles, and do they yield when necessary? 

Speaker 1:
Is it better to yield or not yield in certain situations?

Speaker 2:
It depends on the situation. For example, if there are illegally parked cars and a cyclist is about to move into your lane, you might need to honk and proceed to avoid an accident. Legally, this might be acceptable, but from a professional and ethical standpoint, it can come across as impatient and aggressive. It's important to assess each scenario carefully.
Speaker 1:
So, you're saying that while it's not illegal according to the rules, from a professional ethics standpoint, it seems a bit impatient and irritable, which isn't good.

Speaker 2:
Yes, it depends on the situation. You need to assess whether to yield or not. It's not just about rushing or driving fast, or even driving under the influence. The key is to anticipate and try to avoid accidents. Sometimes, you can't avoid it, but you should always try.

Speaker 1:
I understand. What do you think is the biggest difference between experienced drivers and new drivers?

Speaker 2:
New drivers often lack driving experience. For example, they might not know when to yield or not. Experienced drivers are more familiar with traffic regulations. For instance, when making a U-turn, an experienced driver knows the rules and whether it's allowed. They know that you shouldn't make a U-turn over a pedestrian crossing; you should take a wider turn. New drivers might not consider these details and just make the turn if they think they can. They might not use their turn signals when parking, which is crucial for safety. They also might not check their mirrors.

Speaker 1:
Are there any other differences? It seems like new drivers are more hesitant and less familiar with the rules. Do you think new drivers don't use turn signals because they haven't developed the habit?

Speaker 2:
Yes, they haven't developed the habit. Also, some driving schools and instructors might not instill confidence in them.

Speaker 1:
But driving school instructors should ensure they learn these habits, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, ideally. But I think the problem is that the training period in driving schools is too short nowadays. They don't have enough time to develop these habits. When I learned to drive, we trained for a year, which helped us develop good driving habits.
**Speaker 1:**
Back in the day, we used to train for a year to get our driver's license. The instructor would constantly remind us to check the mirrors every 5 to 10 seconds. Nowadays, people get their licenses in just a month or two. How can they develop good habits in such a short time? They lack the psychological resilience needed for driving. When they encounter heavy traffic, they panic and can't handle it. This is what I mean by driving experience.

**Speaker 2:**
So, there's a significant gap between a novice and an experienced driver. Moving on to another topic, you mentioned using some driver-assist features like cruise control and maintaining distance from the car in front. Have you ever ridden in a self-driving car?

**Speaker 1:**
No, I haven't.

**Speaker 2:**
Whether it's self-driving or driver-assist, what aspects do you think these automated systems can never replicate as well as a human driver?

**Speaker 1:**
Well, these systems rely on computers and cameras to make calculations. For example, when I'm driving on the highway and maintaining distance from the car in front, if another car tries to cut in, I can immediately sense it and ease off the gas. The car will gradually slow down without me having to brake hard. But with automated systems, if a car signals to cut in, the system might not react in time. It could continue at the same speed until it suddenly detects the car, causing a jerky reaction. This is a fundamental difference. Automated systems can't anticipate and react like a human can. I've experimented with these features, but I rarely use them. I mostly rely on cruise control, but I don't trust driver-assist systems. I only trust my own judgment and control over the gas pedal.
Speaker 1: I mostly use cruise control, but I don't use assisted driving. I don't trust it. Even now, I only trust my own foot on the gas pedal. That's how I am.

Speaker 2: So, you mean you think the predictive capabilities of these assistive functions are not reliable. For example, you mentioned that the system can't properly judge when to make a left turn.

Speaker 1: Yes, when another car signals a left turn, it's indicating that it wants to move into your lane.

Speaker 2: Exactly, it's telling you that it's coming in.

Speaker 1: But the system only reacts after the car has already started to move in.

Speaker 2: Right, it relies on the front camera and a sensor.

Speaker 1: So, you mean it only measures the distance to the car in front?

Speaker 2: Yes, it only relies on the front sensor.

Speaker 1: It assumes that the distance to the car in front is the only factor.

Speaker 2: Exactly.

Speaker 1: It doesn't consider whether the car in front is the same one we were following before.

Speaker 2: That's correct.

Speaker 1: Where did it come from?

Speaker 2: Exactly. For instance, if I'm driving at 80 km/h and there's a car behind me flashing its high beams, it means it wants to overtake. I might let it pass by moving to the side. But if you let the computer handle it, it will just keep driving at 80 km/h without acknowledging the car behind. It doesn't know there's a car wanting to overtake.

Speaker 1: So, the predictive capability isn't quite right.

Speaker 2: Exactly. At this stage, I don't trust it.

Speaker 1: What about in the future?

Speaker 2: I don't have high hopes for the future either. In my lifetime, I doubt I'll be riding in a fully autonomous car. I'm used to driving myself.

Speaker 1: How do you judge pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles during your drive today?

Speaker 2: It's mostly about observing their direction and movements. You have to watch their dynamics closely.

Speaker 1: It's hard to explain, right?

Speaker 2: Yes, there are too many scenarios. For example, if someone suddenly appears at an intersection, you can't predict that. The best you can do is slow down. Always slow down at intersections; that's the most basic rule.

Speaker 1: One last question. When you were making a U-turn earlier, there were many cars and people around. How do you decide when it's safe to proceed?

Speaker 2: My basic judgment is to check if the U-turn spot is clear. If there are oncoming cars or electric bikes blocking the way, there's no point in stopping there. You need to see if the area is clear before making the turn.
Speaker 1:
If you encounter a situation at an intersection without a traffic bridge, especially in busy commercial areas in Beijing where there are a lot of pedestrians, how would you handle it? Because once you yield, you might miss the light and have to wait a long time for the next one.

Speaker 2:
I think the key is to stay calm and not get frustrated. If there's a traffic light, I would follow it. If pedestrians don't let me go, there's nothing I can do. At least I'm following the signal. If there are no traffic lights, I would yield to pedestrians at the crosswalk. When they let me go, I'll proceed. If someone is in a bigger hurry than me, I'll let them go first. If they make it through, I'll follow. My mindset is to be patient and yield when necessary. If new drivers are not considerate, there's nothing I can do about it.

Speaker 1:
Got it. I don't have any more questions. Do you have anything else to add?

Speaker 2:
No, that's all. Thank you for the interview.

Speaker 1:
Thank you very much for your time today. I really appreciate it.

Speaker 2:
No problem at all.

Speaker 1:
Thank you again. It's already 7:10.

Speaker 2:
Yes, time flies.

Speaker 1:
Oh, right. Please fill out your information so we can process your payment through Tsinghua University's finance department. It might take about a month since it's a public transaction.

Speaker 2:
Will you notify me, or should I check it myself?

Speaker 1:
Yes, we'll notify you.

Speaker 2:
I'll get my bank card details from my bag and fill out the form.

Speaker 1:
I'll get it for you right now.

Speaker 2:
Thank you. I'll fill out the necessary information.

Speaker 1:
We appreciate your experience and help. Thank you.
Thank you, thank you. I think I should fill in my bank card information here as well.

Speaker 1:
Today, I mainly wanted to talk to you because you have a lot of experience. Besides, I'm here to help you with everything.

Speaker 2:
How much is the full amount? Is it 800? Okay, thank you. It should be a certain branch of a certain bank.

Speaker 1:
The business information might need to be more accurate.

Speaker 2:
The bank branch, oh, my phone...

Speaker 1:
Yes, thank you again.

Speaker 2:
Let me check, it should be Beijing Min... Let me check the Industrial and Commercial Bank.

Speaker 1:
I remember you can check that in the app.

Speaker 2:
I'll check my app.

Speaker 1:
Make sure the work unit's account doesn't get returned and needs to be re-sent.

Speaker 2:
What does it mean to fill in my work unit? If it's a public-to-public transfer, it will still go to my personal card.

Speaker 1:
Yes, just fill in anything, your previous work unit, previous school, anything will do. As long as there's something to fill in, it's fine.
