**Speaker 1:**
I would like to start by asking you a few questions about your usual travel habits. Do you often travel by car? Is it usually for long or short distances? And typically, how long do these trips last?

**Speaker 2:**
How long? Usually within 40 minutes.

**Speaker 1:**
So, short trips within 40 minutes. How did you feel about this particular ride in our vehicle?

**Speaker 2:**
It felt okay, just average.

**Speaker 1:**
Why did it feel just average?

**Speaker 2:**
I felt that the driver braked very abruptly.

**Speaker 1:**
The driver braked abruptly. Why didn't you use the handle? I didn't see you holding onto it.

**Speaker 2:**
I thought it was manageable, so I just tolerated it.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it was within an acceptable range for you?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was acceptable.

**Speaker 1:**
At what point would you feel the need to hold onto the handle?

**Speaker 2:**
If the braking caused me to lurch forward significantly.

**Speaker 1:**
If you had a choice, what type of vehicle would you prefer to travel in?

**Speaker 2:**
Is there any danger involved?

**Speaker 1:**
For example, an SUV or a sedan?

**Speaker 2:**
An SUV.

**Speaker 1:**
Why?

**Speaker 2:**
Because it's more spacious. Yes, it's more spacious.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you have a preference between gasoline cars and electric cars?

**Speaker 2:**
No, they feel pretty much the same to me. Do you drive yourself?

**Speaker 1:**
Do you drive?

**Speaker 2:**
How should I put it? I have a license but I don't drive.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you think you would drive?

**Speaker 2:**
I think I would be quite steady.

**Speaker 1:**
Next, I will play the video of our recent drive. If at any point you feel a change in your experience, please let me know.

**Speaker 2:**
A change in experience.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, and at specific moments, I might pause the video to ask about your feelings. Shall we start?

**Speaker 2:**
The video is 15 minutes long, right?

**Speaker 1:**
No, it's 16 minutes because it includes some stationary time in the car. Let's skip to the starting point. How did you feel when the car started?

**Speaker 2:**
When the car started.

**Speaker 1:**
It started suddenly. Did it jolt you?

**Speaker 2:**
No, because I wasn't really watching the video.

**Speaker 1:**
Was there anything special when you were in the car?

**Speaker 2:**
No, nothing special. The driver turned right and then right again at the end of the road.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about the multiple turns the driver made while exiting the parking lot?
**Speaker 1:** Hello, sir. When he made a right turn from there and then another right turn at the end of the road, how do you think he did?

**Speaker 2:** Well, it seemed like he wasn't very familiar with the route.

**Speaker 1:** So, you think he was not very skilled?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, he might have been following the navigation, but it seemed like he wanted to turn left initially and then corrected to turn right.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think he was unfamiliar with the route? How about his handling of the car, like speed control and braking?

**Speaker 2:** His speed control was inconsistent. At one point, he suddenly accelerated.

**Speaker 1:** Was that right after he started driving?

**Speaker 2:** No, it was while he was already on the road.

**Speaker 1:** So, you think he was not familiar with the initial turns?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, he wasn't familiar with the route, but his driving skills seemed fine.

**Speaker 1:** When he made the right turn, did you feel safe? Any concerns about safety?

**Speaker 2:** No, I didn't have any concerns.

**Speaker 1:** Was it because he was driving slowly or because there were no other cars?

**Speaker 2:** It was because I trust your drivers.

**Speaker 1:** You trust our drivers?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I trust the drivers you provide. When we reached the end of the road, he took a left turn to stay on the main route.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel safe and comfortable on the side road?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it felt safe and comfortable.

**Speaker 1:** When he changed lanes, were you worried about other cars hitting us? Did you notice any cars nearby?

**Speaker 2:** No, I didn't notice any.

**Speaker 1:** Were you looking to the right at that time?

**Speaker 2:** I don't remember. 

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel any discomfort from bumps on the main road due to manhole covers?

**Speaker 2:** No, but his sudden acceleration made me uncomfortable. It felt like he accelerated too quickly.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:** I was worried that another car might suddenly appear.

**Speaker 1:** So, you were concerned at that moment?

**Speaker 2:** Yes.

**Speaker 1:** When he made a U-turn and the reverse sensor beeped, were you worried about hitting the nearby car?

**Speaker 2:** No, I wasn't worried.

**Speaker 1:** When he didn't complete the U-turn in one go, how did you feel? Did you think it was normal?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I thought it was normal.
**Speaker 1:** Did you take the train?

**Speaker 2:** No, I wasn't worried.

**Speaker 1:** When he made the U-turn and didn't make it in one go, how did you feel? Did you think it was a normal U-turn?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it seemed normal.

**Speaker 1:** You didn't feel uncomfortable at that time, right?

**Speaker 2:** No, I didn't.

**Speaker 1:** There was a bit of a bump here. Did you notice pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles when the car was passing through the intersection?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I did.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about the distance the driver kept from them?

**Speaker 2:** It was fine, all good.

**Speaker 1:** We are about to reach the destination. After that, turn right at the traffic light.

**Speaker 2:** Okay.

**Speaker 1:** Did you notice the car honking? Was it because the car was too close to us?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, but I didn't pay much attention to it.

**Speaker 1:** Were you feeling sleepy in the afternoon?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, a bit. I might not have noticed much.

**Speaker 1:** Did you fall asleep in the car?

**Speaker 2:** I dozed off a bit, yes, with my eyes closed.

**Speaker 1:** When did you start dozing off?

**Speaker 2:** Probably after we made the turn.

**Speaker 1:** Did you worry about safety with the reverse radar beeping?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't know it was a warning.

**Speaker 1:** You didn't know it was a warning? Could you see the car from your perspective?

**Speaker 2:** Why was it beeping? Was there a problem?

**Speaker 1:** It was probably because the car was too close.

**Speaker 2:** The other car was too close, right?

**Speaker 1:** Yes.

**Speaker 2:** But it wasn't that far away.

**Speaker 1:** It came from behind us, and from our perspective, we could only see that it was close.

**Speaker 2:** Turn right into Zhongguancun.

**Speaker 1:** Was the speed too fast when turning?

**Speaker 2:** I felt the turn was a bit sharp.

**Speaker 1:** Was it just that turn or all of them?

**Speaker 2:** Just that one.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** It was different from my usual car rides.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel it was more uncomfortable than usual?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, usually the turns aren't that sharp.

**Speaker 1:** Were the turns too sudden?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, they were.

**Speaker 1:** When driving straight at a constant speed, did you feel the ride was smooth?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, with my eyes closed, it felt smooth. If it wasn't, I would have woken up and opened my eyes.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel any bumps when going over the speed bumps?

**Speaker 2:** No, I didn't.

**Speaker 1:** We are about to reach the destination. After that, turn left at the end of the road.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I didn't notice much.

**Speaker 1:** We are almost there.
**Speaker 1:**  
Turn left here. I never really noticed this area before.

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, exactly. After 100 meters, we will reach a nearby point.

**Speaker 1:**  
So, is it the same for these potentially crowded small roads?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, even with my eyes closed, I can feel if the ride is smooth or not.

**Speaker 1:**  
So, you didn't see this part at all, right?

**Speaker 2:**  
No, I didn't see it at all. I didn't ask about it either.

**Speaker 1:**  
Now that you look at it again, do you think this road is safe?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, he seems to be driving quite fast.

**Speaker 1:**  
Hmm, you think he's driving very fast on this road.

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**  
So, if you had seen it at the time, you might have felt unsafe, right?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, 400 meters ahead, there is a traffic camera 100 meters away.

**Speaker 1:**  
Did you feel the road was bumpy or smooth?

**Speaker 2:**  
At the landmark, then turn right. Give me the camera.

**Speaker 1:**  
Do you remember where you closed your eyes and then opened them again? Or did you keep them closed the whole time?

**Speaker 2:**  
I think it was almost when we were nearby.

**Speaker 1:**  
Okay, so it was almost when we were coming back.

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**  
So, you felt the turn by looking at the camera?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, you can see the camera shaking left and right.

**Speaker 1:**  
Turning right, but you didn't feel it in the car?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, that's right. Please stay in the right lane. 120 meters ahead at the traffic light.

**Speaker 1:**  
Now looking at it, do you think the car is not stable?

**Speaker 2:**  
Turn right, then immediately reach the destination.

**Speaker 1:**  
When the car slowed down for the turn, did you feel it was a sudden deceleration? If you can't remember, you can check the video.

**Speaker 2:**  
Hmm.

**Speaker 1:**  
Was it okay or not?

**Speaker 2:**  
It was okay. We are 300 meters away from the nearby point.

**Speaker 2:**  
We are about to reach the scenic spot, then turn right.

**Speaker 1:**  
Did you feel anything at that time, or was it still fast?

**Speaker 1:**  
At that time, he was driving fast. Did you have any safety concerns or feel uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**  
I felt uncomfortable and unsafe.

**Speaker 1:**  
You felt uncomfortable and unsafe.

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, exactly. There were actually quite a few cars on this road. It wasn't in the suburbs.

**Speaker 1:**  
So, the right turn was okay?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, it was okay. After a year, we reached the destination. He was driving fast on such a narrow road.

**Speaker 1:**  
Hmm, he should have slowed down, right?

**Speaker 2:**  
At the landmark, then turn right. Entering a street in Zhongguancun. Oh, look how close that bicycle is.

**Speaker 1:**  
Yes, looking at it now, it still feels worrying.

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**  
It beeped again.

**Speaker 2:**  
400 meters ahead, there is a traffic camera 100 meters away.
**Speaker 1:**
Right, looking back, it still feels quite concerning.

**Speaker 2:**
Yeah, it does.

**Speaker 1:**
The alert went off again.

**Speaker 2:**
In 400 meters, you'll reach a point where there's a traffic violation camera 100 meters ahead.

**Speaker 1:**
We just drove this route a while ago. Were you still closing your eyes here? The car is moving too fast, it's a bit unsafe, and it's quite bumpy. Turn left ahead.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes. We can't eat while driving anymore. Turn left, and then we'll reach a tricky spot. The driver's performance here is a bit lacking.

**Speaker 1:**
I didn't notice the left turn here.

**Speaker 2:**
Yeah, missed it. In a few meters, we'll reach the base. The movie is about to reach the base. Continue straight through the traffic light, then go another 20 meters.

**Speaker 1:**
Is the braking on this entire stretch quite abrupt?

**Speaker 2:**
We had one major upgrade, and after that, it felt a bit better. Continue straight for 150 meters, then turn right at the end of the road. Please stay on the main road until you reach the nearby point, then turn right at the end of the road and merge onto the main road.

**Speaker 2:**
Turn right onto the main road, then move to the far-left lane.

**Speaker 1:**
Here, when you turn right onto the main road, how do you feel? Do you remember this part?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I remember. This part, I opened my eyes.

**Speaker 1:**
The kid...

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, we're almost back. In 300 meters, there's a traffic light. The intersection ahead is quite crucial.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you evaluate the driving operation in this segment? At the intersection ahead.

**Speaker 2:**
Enter the side road, then turn right in 200 meters. There are many obstacles.

**Speaker 1:**
Now, looking back, the driver's skills don't seem very good.

**Speaker 2:**
The camera is on the side road, then turn right in 200 meters.

**Speaker 1:**
He has a few years of driving experience. We don't hire complete novices; he definitely has some driving experience. Did you observe the driver at that time, or were you just looking at the road conditions and the car?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't see any signs. I only looked once when the driver wasn't looking.

**Speaker 1:**
From his driving, can you tell that he has a rather impatient personality?

**Speaker 2:**
Turn right soon, then immediately keep left.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you feel about this segment?

**Speaker 2:**
This segment is relatively polite, I think.

**Speaker 1:**
Politeness is a good thing.

**Speaker 2:**
Turn again, keep left on the main road, then turn left in 80 meters. Enter the internal road, then turn right in 60 meters. Turn left into the internal road, then turn right. Turn right soon, then immediately turn right.

**Speaker 1:**
Right, maybe. This navigation system is CC's own, so it might have some settings we're not aware of. I have a few more questions for you. Although you didn't use the handle, we talked about some points you found dangerous. Can you recall any other particularly dangerous moments?
**Speaker 1:** I have a few remaining questions for you. Although you didn't use the handle, we talked about some points you found dangerous. Can you recall any other dangerous driving behaviors?

**Speaker 2:** No, that's all.

**Speaker 1:** So, it's just what we discussed in the video, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:** When you're a passenger in someone else's car, what behaviors from the driver make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:** Well, when I'm usually in the car...

**Speaker 1:** Sitting in the back seat.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, yes. If the driver brakes suddenly, I feel unsafe.

**Speaker 1:** Sudden braking, got it. Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** When the driving speed isn't consistent.

**Speaker 1:** Like speeding up and slowing down abruptly?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. Also, if the driver suddenly lets go of the steering wheel, causing the car to swerve, it feels very dangerous.

**Speaker 1:** What do you think makes driving safer?

**Speaker 2:** The driver's mindset.

**Speaker 1:** Mindset, haha.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, staying calm and focused.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think today's experience was thrilling?

**Speaker 2:** It was okay. If I had to rate it out of 10, maybe a 6.

**Speaker 1:** Do you remember any other uncomfortable actions by the driver? No? Just what we discussed earlier?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, controlling the speed of the car.

**Speaker 1:** Poor speed control.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:** When you're a passenger, what other behaviors from the driver make you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Smoking. Occasionally, I encounter drivers who smoke, and I want to complain.

**Speaker 1:** In terms of driving?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, what I mentioned earlier.

**Speaker 1:** So, unsafe driving also makes you uncomfortable, right?

**Speaker 2:** Of course.

**Speaker 1:** What kind of driving makes you feel more comfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Smooth driving, without sudden braking.

**Speaker 1:** So, you think safety and comfort are closely related?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, if you're comfortable, it's usually a safer state. If you're uncomfortable, like with sudden braking, it's definitely not safe. Safety and comfort involve both mental and physical comfort.

**Speaker 1:** What do you think makes a good or professional driver? What qualities should they have?

**Speaker 2:** How to put it... the points we just discussed.

**Speaker 1:** Meeting safety and comfort standards?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly.
**Speaker 1:** So, how would you describe it? Just the points we mentioned earlier?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it meets the criteria of safety and comfort.

**Speaker 1:** And design, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. I think driving becomes a matter of habit rather than constant thought.

**Speaker 1:** So, you're saying that experienced drivers don't need to think much while driving?

**Speaker 2:** They are just very skilled.

**Speaker 1:** Driving has become second nature to them, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:** What do you think is the biggest difference between experienced drivers and new drivers?

**Speaker 2:** The level of proficiency and mindset.

**Speaker 1:** Do you consider yourself an experienced driver or a new driver?

**Speaker 2:** I'm not even a new driver.

**Speaker 1:** Have you ever tried autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:** You mean self-driving cars?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, or any driver assistance systems. Have you experienced them?

**Speaker 2:** No, I haven't. I think it's a bit dangerous.

**Speaker 1:** Based on your understanding of autonomous driving, what aspects do you think it can never match human drivers?

**Speaker 2:** I think emergency handling is one area. Also, subjective judgment might not be as good as humans.

**Speaker 1:** So, mainly in emergency handling, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I think so.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think the recent trip was driven by a human or by an autonomous system?

**Speaker 2:** Was it autonomous driving?

**Speaker 1:** What do you think? Why do you think it was a human?

**Speaker 2:** Because the person was there, reversing and making turns.

**Speaker 1:** And you think if it were autonomous driving, what would it be like?

**Speaker 2:** I'm not too sure.

**Speaker 1:** If the driver was pretending to drive, how would that differ from your usual experience?

**Speaker 2:** The speed control seemed a bit off, not like usual.

**Speaker 1:** So, if it were autonomous driving, you think the machine's settings might be off?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. So, was it autonomous driving just now?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, it was.

**Speaker 2:** Are there any other details that made you think it might be a machine?

**Speaker 1:** I can't think of any right now.

**Speaker 2:** That's okay. One last question: if you were a pedestrian at an intersection without traffic lights, how would you decide when to cross?
**Speaker 1:**
Alright, no problem. So, the last question. For example, now you are a pedestrian, and you need to cross an intersection that doesn't have traffic lights. How do you judge the intentions of the oncoming vehicles?

**Speaker 2:**
Can you repeat that?

**Speaker 1:**
Sure, you are a pedestrian, and you need to cross an intersection without traffic lights. How do you judge whether the oncoming vehicles will yield to you or not?

**Speaker 2:**
Well, you take a couple of steps forward. If the car slows down, it means they are letting you go. If the car doesn't slow down, it means they are not yielding.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you judge by the speed of the car, right? Yes, yes. In such an intersection, how would you choose to cross?

**Speaker 2:**
I would cross when there are fewer vehicles.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you wait until there are fewer cars before crossing. Let me check if there are any other questions. It seems there are no more questions. That's all for our interview. Thank you very much for participating in our experiment today.

**Speaker 2:**
Sure, what is this data for?
