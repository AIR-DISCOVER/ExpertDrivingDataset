**Speaker 1:**
Alright, let's start with some general questions about your usual travel habits. Do you often travel by car? Are your trips typically long or short?

**Speaker 2:**
Usually short trips.

**Speaker 1:**
Mostly within the city, right? How long do these trips usually take?

**Speaker 2:**
About 20 to 30 minutes.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you find our vehicle during this experiment?

**Speaker 2:**
I felt that the car was a bit unstable, especially during turns and lane changes.

**Speaker 1:**
Turns and lane changes, got it. How would you rate the driver's skills?

**Speaker 2:**
The driver's skills were quite good.

**Speaker 1:**
If you had a choice, what type of car do you prefer to ride in? For example, an off-road vehicle, SUV, gasoline car, electric car, or sedan?

**Speaker 2:**
I prefer gasoline cars.

**Speaker 1:**
Why is that?

**Speaker 2:**
I guess it's because I'm more used to them. Most of the cars I've ridden in from the beginning were gasoline cars, so I'm more accustomed to them.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think there's a difference between gasoline cars and electric cars?

**Speaker 2:**
I feel the power is different.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you drive yourself often?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really, I just got my driver's license recently.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, let's review the video of your ride. I'll ask you some questions, and feel free to interrupt if you have any comments or if you felt uncomfortable or unsafe at any point during the ride.

**Speaker 1:**
Now, let's look at the part where the driver makes a turn. How did you feel about the driver's maneuvering during this turn?

**Speaker 2:**
At first, I didn't feel much. It was quite smooth initially. But later on, the bumps became more noticeable.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it started off smooth but got bumpier later. If you feel any discomfort during the review, please let me know.

**Speaker 1:**
We are approaching a right turn at the end of the road, followed by a waypoint. We should be in South Susie. How did you feel about entering the side road?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't feel anything special.

**Speaker 1:**
We are near the waypoint, and in 200 meters, we will merge onto the main road. We are providing city navigation. In 150 meters, we will merge onto the main road.
**Speaker 1:** In 200 meters, merge onto the main road. We are providing you with immersive city navigation. In 150 meters, keep left to merge onto the main road.

**Speaker 1:** The process of merging onto the main road can be quite complex.

**Speaker 1:** In 300 meters, you will reach a waypoint.

**Speaker 1:** You are about to reach a waypoint. After that, make a U-turn at the traffic light. Once you reach the waypoint, make a U-turn at the traffic light to enter the main road.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about the U-turn process just now?

**Speaker 2:** At first, I thought he almost couldn't make the U-turn because he had to reverse once in the middle.

**Speaker 1:** Oh, you thought he couldn't make the turn at first. Was there anything else? In 300 meters, how did you feel about not making the turn in one go? Did it affect you in any way?

**Speaker 2:** Not really. I think it's quite normal because different cars have different lengths, so making a U-turn can be tricky.

**Speaker 1:** If he had made the U-turn in one go, would it have felt different to you?

**Speaker 2:** It would have felt smoother.

**Speaker 1:** Smoother.

**Speaker 1:** After making the U-turn, did he accelerate smoothly? Did he honk the horn?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I remember he honked once in the middle.

**Speaker 1:** Why do you think he honked?

**Speaker 2:** Probably to alert the nearby vehicles.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think he was signaling that he was about to change lanes? Did it affect you in any way?

**Speaker 2:** No, it didn't.

**Speaker 1:** You are about to reach a waypoint. After that, turn right. Maintain a steady speed and then turn right.

**Speaker 2:** I felt it was quite enjoyable.

**Speaker 1:** He was driving fast, and it looked fast on the video too. Did the speed make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:** No, not at all. He braked in time, so it didn't feel unsafe.

**Speaker 1:** By timely braking, you mean?

**Speaker 2:** He slowed down appropriately when making turns.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about his braking during turns? Was it abrupt or timely?

**Speaker 2:** It was timely, not abrupt. Yes, turn right.

**Speaker 1:** In 300 meters, you will reach a waypoint. After that, turn right at the traffic light. Once you reach the waypoint, turn right at the traffic light to enter Zhongguancun North Second Street. In 400 meters, you will reach a waypoint.

**Speaker 1:** You are about to reach a waypoint. After that, continue straight.

**Speaker 2:** Sometimes, I felt a bit unsafe because of pedestrians and cyclists nearby. Cyclists can be quite unpredictable.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, that's true.
**Speaker 1:** There were pedestrians and some bicycles. I felt a bit unsafe because bicycles can move unpredictably.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, the process felt a bit unsafe because...

**Speaker 1:** There were more bicycles than pedestrians.

**Speaker 2:** How would you evaluate the driver's actions in this situation?

**Speaker 1:** I think the driver was probably aware, but as a passenger, I might not notice everything as clearly since I'm not the one driving.

**Speaker 2:** What do you think the driver could do better to make you feel safer?

**Speaker 1:** Maybe slow down a bit.

**Speaker 2:** Approaching the scenic spot, then turn left at the end of the road, and you will reach the destination. In 100 meters, you will arrive at the scenic spot. Turn left at the end of the road.

**Speaker 1:** Turn left. In 400 meters, you will reach the destination. There is a traffic camera 100 meters ahead.

**Speaker 1:** You will soon reach the destination, then turn right.

**Speaker 1:** Approaching the destination, then turn right. This is actually an intersection without traffic lights, although the road conditions are good now. It was similar when we passed through this intersection before.

**Speaker 2:** I didn't think much about it at the time. Since the road conditions were good and there were no safety hazards when turning, I thought it was fine to turn.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about it?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't have any particular feelings.

**Speaker 1:** Stay in the right lane. In 150 meters, turn right at the traffic light. Stay in the right lane, turn right at the traffic light, and you will immediately reach the destination. Turn right at the destination, and you will immediately arrive. In 300 meters, you will reach the scenic spot.

**Speaker 2:** The car also accelerates when going straight.

**Speaker 1:** You will soon reach the scenic spot. Do you think this acceleration feels good?

**Speaker 2:** Sometimes, when the road ahead is clear, it's fine to accelerate a bit.

**Speaker 1:** Turn right. In 100 meters, you will reach the destination. You will soon reach the destination. What was the situation when you used the handle?

**Speaker 2:** Because of the acceleration when going straight and then suddenly decelerating and turning, the car made me feel a bit uncomfortable, especially when sitting in the back. The sudden movements made me feel uneasy.

**Speaker 1:** So, the driver decelerated and turned after going straight.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, and I think it also has to do with the car. Initially, the turns felt a bit shaky, but it wasn't very noticeable. After a few turns, the feeling became more pronounced.

**Speaker 1:** Besides the car, how would you evaluate the driver's actions during this time?
**Speaker 1:** After making a few turns, did you notice any significant differences in the driver's handling?

**Speaker 2:** Not really, it felt pretty much the same as before.

**Speaker 1:** But did you feel uncomfortable at any point? Can you describe how?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it felt a bit stuffy, like the early signs of motion sickness.

**Speaker 1:** Was it because the car was shaking too much?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:** In 100 meters, turn right to reach the waypoint. You will soon arrive at the waypoint, then turn right.

**Speaker 1:** Approaching the waypoint, then turn right.

**Speaker 1:** Turn right into Zhongguancun North Street.

**Speaker 1:** In 400 meters, you will reach the waypoint. There is a traffic camera 100 meters ahead.

**Speaker 1:** You will soon reach the waypoint, then turn left.

**Speaker 1:** Approaching the waypoint, then turn left, and you will reach the waypoint.

**Speaker 1:** In 100 meters, you will reach the waypoint. Approaching the waypoint.

**Speaker 1:** Go straight through the current traffic light, then in 150 meters, you will reach the waypoint. The light is about to turn green.

**Speaker 1:** Go straight, then in 150 meters, you will reach the waypoint. You will soon reach the waypoint, then turn right at the end of the road to enter the main road. Approaching the waypoint, then turn right at the end of the road to enter the main road. In 100 meters, turn right at the end of the road to enter the main road, then move to the leftmost lane. In 400 meters, make a U-turn at the traffic light and stay on the main road. In 300 meters, make a U-turn at the traffic light. Please stay in the leftmost lane, approaching the traffic light.

**Speaker 1:** Make a U-turn to enter the side road, then turn right in 200 meters.

**Speaker 1:** Turn right in 200 meters.

**Speaker 1:** Prepare to turn right.

**Speaker 1:** Then immediately move to the left lane.

**Speaker 2:** When turning right, I felt the start was a bit rushed.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, especially during the start.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because the car in front hadn't moved yet, and there were delivery bikes and pedestrians around. It felt a bit tight.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about that?

**Speaker 2:** I think it would be better to wait a bit, to be more cautious.

**Speaker 1:** Were you worried about a collision?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because the delivery bikes were moving quite fast.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel unsafe or uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Not to the point of feeling unsafe, but there was some discomfort.

**Speaker 1:** Did you have any concerns at that moment?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I did have some concerns, but I didn't press the handle.

**Speaker 1:** Why didn't you press the handle?

**Speaker 2:** I felt it was just a driving habit, and I thought it would be fine.

**Speaker 1:** Was there anything else? Did you notice any other dangerous maneuvers?

**Speaker 2:** No, nothing else.
**Speaker 1:** Let's move on to some other questions. Besides the controls on the steering wheel, have you noticed any particularly dangerous operations related to 4G?

**Speaker 2:** No, I haven't.

**Speaker 1:** How do you think the driving could be made safer? Is there room for improvement?

**Speaker 2:** Okay, yeah. I think observing the road conditions more carefully at each stage could help. Slowing down a bit while doing so would be beneficial. Anything else? No, that's it.

**Speaker 1:** Apart from this instance, when you usually ride in someone else's car, what kind of driver behavior makes you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:** Sudden braking and sharp turns.

**Speaker 1:** Sudden braking and sharp turns, I see. Now, let's talk about comfort. Besides the controls on the steering wheel, is there anything that makes you feel uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** No, nothing in particular.

**Speaker 1:** How do you think the driving could be made more comfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Well, reducing the amount of sudden acceleration in straight lines would help. I feel that too much acceleration followed by sudden deceleration creates a noticeable speed difference.

**Speaker 1:** So, using straight-line acceleration more moderately and slowing down a bit would help, as the rapid changes in speed during braking and starting can be uncomfortable. What behaviors from other drivers make you feel uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Nothing specific comes to mind.

**Speaker 1:** What do you think makes a driver a professional and good driver? What are the minimum requirements?

**Speaker 2:** A good driver should drive smoothly. For example, when reversing, they shouldn't need to repeat the maneuver. That would be a sign of a competent driver.

**Speaker 1:** So, when making a U-turn, they should be able to do it in one go without needing to adjust multiple times. Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, they should have an accurate grasp of the road conditions.

**Speaker 1:** What do you mean by grasping the road conditions?

**Speaker 2:** Being aware of whether there are pedestrians, other vehicles, or bicycles nearby, and observing their movements. Anything else? No, that's it.

**Speaker 1:** What do you think is the biggest difference between a novice driver and an experienced driver?

**Speaker 2:** Novice drivers tend to be more cautious and their driving state changes noticeably because they lack experience. This can lead to sudden braking and other abrupt actions. Experienced drivers, on the other hand, are more familiar with the roads and can anticipate conditions better.

**Speaker 1:** They have a better understanding of the road conditions and lane changes. Anything else? Let's talk about autonomous driving. What do you think are the aspects that autonomous driving can never replace human drivers?

**Speaker 2:** I think in unexpected situations, like if a bicycle suddenly changes lanes, autonomous driving might not handle it as well as a human driver.
**Speaker 1:**
What do you think?

**Speaker 2:**
I think when encountering sudden situations, like if there's a bicycle nearby and it suddenly changes lanes, the automatic driving system might not decelerate or brake as quickly as a human would.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
There are also issues with straight-line acceleration. If you're in a hurry, a human can subjectively decide to accelerate a bit more to save time, but an autonomous driving system might just stick to the regular speed, which isn't as flexible. And then there's the issue of making U-turns. Different cars have different turning radii, and I feel that an autonomous system might struggle to make a U-turn in one go, especially on roads of varying widths and with different car lengths.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
Not at the moment. Do you think the recent trip was driven by a human or an autonomous system, based on your experience?

**Speaker 2:**
I think it was driven by a human.

**Speaker 1:**
Why do you think so?

**Speaker 2:**
Because I felt there were still areas where human intervention was evident. I could sense subjective decisions in lane changes, U-turns, and acceleration.

**Speaker 1:**
Let's assume the car was actually an autonomous vehicle, and the driver was just a safety monitor. Would that change your perception of the trip?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I would feel that there would be more unsafe situations because of the lack of human control. I think the response to sudden situations wouldn't be as timely. Also, if it were an autonomous vehicle, I felt a bit uncomfortable and slightly car sick earlier, which I think would be more pronounced.

**Speaker 1:**
Why do you think so?

**Speaker 2:**
Because I believe an autonomous system follows the route and navigation strictly, but it doesn't consider passenger comfort and behavior as meticulously as a human driver would.

**Speaker 1:**
Compared to the driver we just had, do you think an autonomous system would perform better or worse?

**Speaker 2:**
I think each has its strengths.

**Speaker 1:**
Regarding passenger comfort, do you think an autonomous system would do better than the driver we just had?

**Speaker 2:**
I think an autonomous system might avoid issues like sudden speed changes, which could be better in that aspect.

**Speaker 1:**
Were there any details during the trip that made you think it might not have been driven by a human?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, during the U-turn. It felt like the turn was made very abruptly, which made me think it might not have been a human driver.
**Speaker 1:** Is it possible that the driver wasn't a real person? Were there any details that made you think so?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, there were.

**Speaker 1:** Can you describe what happened during the U-turn? It seemed like the car just turned abruptly.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it felt like the car turned very naturally, but then it suddenly stopped as if it couldn't make the turn. The reversing also seemed very mechanical. That's why it didn't feel like a human was driving.

**Speaker 1:** If a human driver felt they couldn't make the turn, they would probably start reversing much earlier.

**Speaker 2:** Exactly. A human driver would anticipate the difficulty and start reversing sooner.

**Speaker 1:** But this car only stopped when it was very close to the obstacle.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it was obvious that it couldn't make the turn, and only then did it stop and reverse.

**Speaker 1:** So, you think this detail suggests it might have been an autonomous vehicle?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, that's what I think.

**Speaker 1:** One last question, which is not directly related to riding in the car. Suppose you are a pedestrian at an intersection without traffic signals. How do you judge the intentions of non-motorized vehicles or cars?

**Speaker 2:** I look at their indicators, like turn signals.

**Speaker 1:** Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** I also observe their speed. If the vehicle doesn't slow down, it's clear that it intends to go straight or turn without yielding to pedestrians. Anything else?

**Speaker 1:** No, that's all. Okay, we've covered most of the questions. Lastly, do you have any feedback on the driver's operation or your overall riding experience? Any positives or negatives?

**Speaker 2:** No, nothing more to add.

**Speaker 1:** Alright, that concludes our interview. Thank you for your participation.
