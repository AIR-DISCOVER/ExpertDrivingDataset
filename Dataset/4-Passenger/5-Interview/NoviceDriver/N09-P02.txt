**Speaker 1:**
When the driver changes lanes, do you feel anything special? Or is it just a normal feeling?

**Speaker 2:**
It's just normal. The lane change was fine.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, the next part is crucial. The U-turn was also well-executed.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the car's sound was good.

**Speaker 1:**
The U-turn was done in one go, which is nice. The road is quite narrow, and usually, it takes two attempts. This time, it was a right turn, and the steering felt normal, right? As a passenger, do you consciously observe things, or do you just sit back and relax?

**Speaker 2:**
I usually just sit back and relax. On this stretch of road, I don't pay much attention to other things.

**Speaker 1:**
For example, if there are pedestrians or suddenly a cyclist appears, do you feel anything different as a passenger?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really. The road conditions are good, so there's nothing special to notice.

**Speaker 1:**
At this time of day, people are either at work or at home resting, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's right.

**Speaker 1:**
Earlier, you saw a cyclist going against traffic. As a passenger, you wouldn't pay much attention to that, would you?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't feel anything.

**Speaker 1:**
And when a pedestrian crossed the road in the middle, it was quite dangerous. But as a passenger, you might not notice these things much, right?

**Speaker 2:**
I know they won't get hit.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you trust the driver a lot, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I feel confident that the driver is paying attention.

**Speaker 1:**
Now, we are approaching a right turn, and later we will make a left turn. This intersection is crucial for our experiment because it doesn't have traffic lights. We specifically chose this intersection to test turning without signals. Are you aware of the complexity of this situation?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I might have noticed.

**Speaker 1:**
If you feel uneasy or uncomfortable, you can press the handle. Your discomfort would be due to the driving itself, not the surrounding environment. You don't focus much on environmental factors, right? Your experience is mainly about the ride itself, not the driving.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's correct.
**Speaker 1:** So, you don't really pay much attention to environmental factors, like how they affect you. You just focus on your subjective experience as a passenger, right? The car isn't driven by you or me.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, that's correct.

**Speaker 1:** Alright, so both times you used the handle were for the same reason? Based on your personal experience, do you remember where it happened?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I think it was to help a newcomer. I vaguely remember the location.

**Speaker 1:** For instance, on a road with good conditions, as a passenger, can you feel the driver accelerating? How does it feel? Is it smooth?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, the acceleration is quite smooth, not abrupt.

**Speaker 1:** That's good to hear. 

**Speaker 1:** In situations where you're on a narrow road and the car next to you is very close, do you feel nervous?

**Speaker 2:** No, not really. But if a car suddenly appears from the left, it can be quite noticeable.

**Speaker 1:** This stretch of road is actually quite manageable. Plus, it's not peak time, so the drive is comfortable. Sometimes it rains or there's a school nearby, which can make it less pleasant.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, that's true.

**Speaker 1:** When the driver stops to let pedestrians cross, do you mind such actions?

**Speaker 2:** I do pay attention to that. It's important to gauge the driver's skill through such actions.

**Speaker 1:** So, you evaluate the driver based on these behaviors?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, especially since I've worked abroad. Drivers there don't usually rush.

**Speaker 1:** I agree. I've also been overseas, and people generally take their time crossing the street.

**Speaker 2:** Exactly, during holidays, there's no rush.

**Speaker 1:** Alright, now we need to make a U-turn. How do you feel about U-turns compared to sharp turns? Do you find them equally acceptable?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, both are fine with me. 

**Speaker 1:** At this intersection, there are many cars, bicycles, and pedestrians. As a passenger, do you feel uneasy seeing so many non-motorized vehicles and pedestrians?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it can be a bit concerning.

**Speaker 1:** So, you prefer a more cautious driving style, avoiding aggressive maneuvers?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. For instance, at this intersection, the driver could have turned earlier without waiting for the green light.

**Speaker 1:** Understood.
**Speaker 1:** Actually, at this intersection, we could have turned earlier. There was no need to drive into the waiting area. Yes, and we didn't need to wait for the red light either. Okay, so that's it for this video. Now, let me ask you some other questions. Today's road conditions were quite good, and there weren't any particularly dangerous situations. Maybe except for that car that suddenly rushed out at the intersection without a signal, which was quite scary. But the driver reacted quickly and stopped in time.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. You pressed the handle twice because of the sudden braking, right? If you don't drive yourself, it might be hard to give a precise answer. How do you think the driver should handle such situations? 

**Speaker 1:** The only option is to stop suddenly. From your perspective, is there any other way to handle it?

**Speaker 2:** Well, not really. But I have encountered similar issues at intersections. 

**Speaker 1:** As a driver, to avoid stopping suddenly at intersections, you should slow down in advance.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, but in some countries, there are stop signs that alert drivers to slow down. In our country, it feels more urgent, so I always make sure to slow down if there are no cars behind me.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, you can pass through directly if it's safe.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, but it's better to slow down a bit for safety.

**Speaker 1:** Besides the two sudden stops marked by the handle, did you notice any other dangerous actions by the driver?

**Speaker 2:** No, not really. On that basis, what do you think makes driving safer?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, besides those two sudden stops, what other safe driving practices do you recommend?

**Speaker 2:** From my perspective, I didn't hear the turn signal when the driver was changing lanes. It should have beeped, but I didn't hear it, so I'm not sure. 

**Speaker 1:** Oh, hold on. Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** No, I think slowing down is always a good idea.

**Speaker 1:** When you're a passenger, outside of this experiment, what driver behaviors make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:** Using a phone while driving.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 2:** Using a phone, driving with one hand. 

**Speaker 1:** Yes, these are major safety concerns.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, safety is paramount.

**Speaker 1:** Right, exactly.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, besides that.

**Speaker 1:** For example, regarding traffic regulations, do you think...
**Speaker 1:**
Yes, that's right.

**Speaker 2:**
Haha, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
For example, do you think drivers should always follow traffic rules strictly? Or are there situations where you think some flexibility is acceptable? What are your thoughts on this?

**Speaker 2:**
I think it depends. For instance, if a driver needs to change lanes in a crowded area, I can accept that. Or if they need to drive on a pedestrian lane in certain situations, that's also acceptable. Even using the bike lane can be fine under specific conditions.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you believe it's acceptable if the driver needs to change lanes in special circumstances, like when it's necessary and doesn't endanger pedestrians or break any rules?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. If it makes the journey faster and doesn't pose a risk to pedestrians, and there are no cameras or penalties involved, then it's understandable.

**Speaker 1:**
I see. Earlier, you mentioned feeling discomfort when the driver used the handles twice. Was that discomfort due to feeling unsafe or just uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
It was because of a sudden jolt.

**Speaker 1:**
Haha, a sudden jolt. If you had to assess, did it affect your sense of safety or comfort more?

**Speaker 2:**
It was more about comfort. If it wasn't on a highway, it wouldn't really affect my sense of safety.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it didn't feel like a threat to your safety?

**Speaker 2:**
Not on these kinds of roads.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it. So, it was mainly about discomfort.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, unless it was on a highway.

**Speaker 1:**
Besides the handle issue, what makes driving more comfortable for you? We talked about safety earlier, but what about comfort?

**Speaker 2:**
A better car generally offers more comfort. But from a driving perspective, maintaining smooth acceleration and deceleration is key.

**Speaker 1:**
Today, our driver had some uncomfortable maneuvers. Besides the handle issue, did you find their driving stable? Are there any behaviors from other drivers that make you uncomfortable or comfortable when you're a passenger?

**Speaker 1:**
Oh, you don't like it when drivers honk excessively, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, and I also don't like it when they don't use turn signals.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you prefer drivers to signal their intentions in advance?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it makes me feel safer when they use turn signals properly.

**Speaker 1:**
Speaking of professionalism, what do you think makes a driver a good or professional driver?
**Speaker 1:** You mentioned something about being professional. I'd like to ask, in your opinion, what makes a good or professional driver?

**Speaker 2:** I don't have any special criteria.

**Speaker 1:** For example, what are the minimum standards a good or professional driver should meet?

**Speaker 2:** It's not about whether they use the pedestrian lane or not. The main thing is how they handle situations on the road, like approaching a crosswalk.

**Speaker 1:** I understand. So, you think meeting these basic criteria makes someone a good driver, right? Do you have any technical requirements, or do you think driving skills are generally similar?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, manual driving.

**Speaker 1:** So, you think whether it's automatic or manual, driving skills are generally the same?

**Speaker 2:** I think so. I'm not sure about other cars, but the feel is similar.

**Speaker 1:** Indeed. If you were to compare a novice driver and an experienced driver, what do you think is the biggest difference?

**Speaker 2:** Mainly their driving state.

**Speaker 1:** Experienced drivers tend to be less focused, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, they can chat with you while driving.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think experienced drivers can multitask, like keeping an eye on the road while talking?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, just like how I can ride a bicycle and talk on the phone at the same time.

**Speaker 1:** So, you think experienced drivers can handle road conditions while chatting, right? They are more relaxed but still in control. Sometimes they even drive with one hand. What do you think about that?

**Speaker 2:** Not all experienced drivers do that.

**Speaker 1:** True. Now, a question that might need some thought: In what ways do you think autonomous cars can never match human drivers?

**Speaker 2:** When it comes to initial detection.

**Speaker 1:** Like things humans can do but autonomous cars can't, no matter how much the algorithms improve?

**Speaker 2:** I'm not sure if they can ever match humans, but having a person there gives a sense of security. If something goes wrong, you can communicate. With autonomous driving...

**Speaker 1:** You mean as a passenger, you feel more secure with a person there?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because they don't want to die either.

**Speaker 1:** So, you prefer having someone there to interact with in case of any situation. Is that correct?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, at least a person wouldn't want to die, but a car might misjudge and not know the consequences.
**Speaker 1:** Can I understand it this way?

**Speaker 2:** At least a person doesn't want to die, but a car might misjudge and not know it. If it makes a wrong judgment, it could still...

**Speaker 1:** So, can I understand that humans can respond more flexibly? For example, if a person misjudges something, they can react quickly and take corrective action. But if a car misjudges, it might...

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it might...

**Speaker 1:** Crash or something like that?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, is it possible that the car itself could report an error? For instance, if you're driving the wrong way on a highway, a person might make an emergency stop. But I'm not sure if a Tesla, for example, would automatically accelerate. Would it stop on the side, or would it continue to recognize obstacles and keep going the wrong way? This is something I...

**Speaker 1:** Actually, it generally wouldn't go the wrong way. With the current lane detection and road condition monitoring systems, these are already integrated into the network. These features are generally in place.

**Speaker 2:** That's the only thing I can think of at the moment.

**Speaker 1:** Okay, so in emergency situations, it can respond relatively well. If I may ask, do you think the car was being driven by a person or was it on autopilot?

**Speaker 2:** I think it might have been a bit of both, haha.

**Speaker 1:** For example, how can you tell if it was a person driving or if it was on autopilot?

**Speaker 2:** Reversing, starting, and turning were all quite...

**Speaker 1:** Smooth. Do you think it was a person or...

**Speaker 2:** If it recognized something and made more adjustments...

**Speaker 1:** If it made more adjustments, it was done by a person, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, if a person made a 10-degree turn, the car might only make a 10-degree adjustment. But if the car made an 11-degree or 20-degree adjustment, that extra bit was done by the car itself.

**Speaker 1:** So you think a person can add an extra layer of control on top of what the car does, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:** So, for example, the car we just talked about was an autonomous vehicle with a safety driver. If the safety driver was just pretending to drive, would you have any special feelings about it?

**Speaker 2:** No, I just felt it was driving well, just like sitting in a normal car.

**Speaker 1:** But it drove better than an average driver?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, better than an average driver.

**Speaker 1:** Haha, better than an average driver, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, that's my first impression.

**Speaker 1:** Alright, so our interview is almost done.

**Speaker 2:** So, was it a person or autopilot just now?

**Speaker 1:** It was a combination of both, right? The driver's skill level was quite good.

**Speaker 2:** Haha, yes, it was good. My friend who drives a big Mercedes or Tesla doesn't drive as well.

**Speaker 1:** Oh, I think it drove very well.
Speaker 1: Thank you for your recognition.

Speaker 2: Haha, yes, it's good. Before, his friends drove big Mercedes and Teslas, but they didn't score as high.

Speaker 1: Oh, I think he drove very steadily. Really? Do you think if he said it was autonomous driving, you would completely believe it?

Speaker 2: Yes, because of the overall experience.

Speaker 1: So, through the passionate reactions and precise turns, you felt like it was autonomous driving. Right, it was very steady.

Speaker 2: Yes, it felt particularly stable.

Speaker 1: Great. Well, that about wraps up our interview for today. Please hold on for a moment.
