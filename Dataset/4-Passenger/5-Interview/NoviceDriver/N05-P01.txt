**Speaker 1:**
Before we start watching the video, I want to ask you a few questions about your usual travel habits. Do you often travel by car?

**Speaker 2:**
Not often.

**Speaker 1:**
Is it usually for long trips or short trips?

**Speaker 2:**
Not often. Short trips, usually between 10 to 30 minutes, sometimes 15 to 30 minutes.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, 15 to 30 minutes. How did you feel about riding in our vehicle for this experiment?

**Speaker 2:**
It was okay. How do you think the driver's skills were?

**Speaker 1:**
I think they were at a normal level, not significantly better or worse than others. Overall, it was quite smooth.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it wasn't much different from your usual experiences? If you had to choose, what type of car would you prefer to travel in?

**Speaker 2:**
Are you referring to buses or cars?

**Speaker 1:**
I mean cars, like SUVs or sedans.

**Speaker 2:**
SUVs.

**Speaker 1:**
Why SUVs?

**Speaker 2:**
They're more spacious.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else? Do you have a preference between gasoline and electric cars?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I think they're about the same.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you drive yourself often?

**Speaker 2:**
Very rarely.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you rate your own driving skills?

**Speaker 2:**
I think I'm okay. I can drive, but I usually only drive for longer trips. For shorter trips, I might choose a more economical car or not drive at all.

**Speaker 1:**
What is your driving style like?

**Speaker 2:**
I tend to drive slowly and prioritize safety.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, now I'll play the video of our recent drive. If at any point you feel your experience changes, please let me know. I'll also pause at certain points to ask for your feedback.

**Speaker 1:**
Let's start from here.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about the start?

**Speaker 2:**
It was fine, nothing uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
So, a normal start overall?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's right.

**Speaker 1:**
The driver made several turns after leaving the parking lot. How did you feel about those turns?

**Speaker 2:**
I think they were fine. Since it was just the beginning, the turns didn't make me feel uncomfortable. However, towards the end, there might have been a turn or two that felt slightly uncomfortable, but not enough to press the handle.

**Speaker 1:**
You didn't press the handle?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't feel the need to. It was just a slight discomfort, nothing major.
**Speaker 1:** You pressed the handle, didn't you?

**Speaker 2:** No, I didn't press it at that time. I didn't feel uncomfortable, just a slight unease, so I didn't press it. In the video, you can see that initially, there were already several thousand kilometers driven, and I felt a slight discomfort, but nothing major.

**Speaker 1:** Alright, let's continue.

**Speaker 2:** Prepare to turn right in 80 meters. You will be entering the city through a new scenic spot.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about the right turn today? Did you feel unsafe or uncomfortable before reaching Nanjing? Was it because the road was empty, or did the driver's skills make you feel secure?

**Speaker 2:** I felt the speed was very slow. Even if it was a random driver, there wouldn't be any safety issues here, probably because of the slow speed. If the driver had been going fast, I might have felt differently. Alright, in 200 meters, keep left.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about the segment on the side road?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't feel anything special.

**Speaker 1:** No bumps? There were many manhole covers on the side road.

**Speaker 2:** It was just a normal driving experience.

**Speaker 1:** When he entered the main road, did he drive too fast?

**Speaker 2:** I think it was normal.

**Speaker 1:** Normal?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, he should enter the main road quickly.

**Speaker 2:** We are about to reach the economic point, then make a U-turn at the traffic light, passing through 7.47 CC.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about the driving on the main road? Any special feelings?

**Speaker 2:** No, it felt normal, the speed was normal.

**Speaker 1:** When he made the U-turn, were you worried he might hit your car?

**Speaker 2:** No, because the speed was very slow.

**Speaker 1:** So, you weren't worried about him hitting other cars?

**Speaker 2:** No, because he was driving slowly.

**Speaker 1:** From your perspective, did he get too close to the other two cars? This place is quite complex with three cars making a U-turn simultaneously.

**Speaker 2:** It was fine, I wasn't worried.

**Speaker 1:** Mainly because of the slow speed, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, if he had been driving fast from the beginning, I might have been concerned.

**Speaker 1:** So, speed is a very important factor for you in judging safety, right? And when the reverse radar beeped, you weren't worried either?

**Speaker 2:** No.
**Speaker 1:**
So, speed is a very important criterion for you to judge safety, right? When the reverse radar beeped, you weren't worried?

**Speaker 2:**
No, because usually, when the radar beeps, there's still some distance. So, I didn't feel worried because of that.

**Speaker 1:**
The driver was driving at a constant speed and just passed over some manhole covers. Did you feel that he slowed down to avoid the bumps?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I was on the road behind, and in some places, I could feel the bumps. But it wasn't enough to make me feel very uncomfortable; it felt normal. Just a bit urgent.

**Speaker 1:**
The normal driving experience is a right turn at Newton CC. Do you think this is something the driver could improve on, like paying more attention to the passenger's experience?

**Speaker 2:**
When I felt tense in the back, I didn't think it was necessary for him to avoid the bumps. If he did, the car would sway more. Just going over them was fine; it didn't feel very bumpy. If you hadn't mentioned the manhole covers, I might have thought it was something else. It felt like there were no major issues. I always thought those manhole covers could be placed together.

**Speaker 1:**
You mean placed here?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, maybe on the roadside or in the green areas.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel when passing through the intersection? The road was quite empty. 300 meters to Nanjing County.

**Speaker 2:**
We are about to reach Nanjing. Then, turn right at the traffic light and continue straight until 7 o'clock.

**Speaker 1:**
This section of constant speed driving, was it smooth until the right turn?

**Speaker 2:**
From this intersection, I noticed we kept making turns. It didn't feel unsafe, just that we were constantly turning. 400 meters to Tokyo Celebration.

**Speaker 1:**
When he passed the pedestrian, were you worried?

**Speaker 2:**
No, because he was far enough and wasn't driving fast. You can see it again.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you felt he wouldn't hit the pedestrian?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, he gave me a stable feeling. If he saw the person from afar and still hit them, that would be a very basic mistake. I don't think he would make such a mistake.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you believe the driver's skill level is not that low?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes.

**Speaker 2:**
We are about to reach Nanjing, continuing on the road.

**Speaker 1:**
Turn left, passing by the school. Did you feel anything?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I felt the manhole covers particularly.

**Speaker 1:**
But as you mentioned earlier, it was within an acceptable range?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, then turn left at the end of the road.
**Speaker 1:**
You mentioned earlier that everything was within an acceptable range. How did you feel about the left turn at the end of the road?

**Speaker 2:**
At that moment, I felt that the company had managed it well. I didn't feel uncomfortable, but there was a slight concern that if it wasn't handled well, it could be uncomfortable. I would have preferred to go straight.

**Speaker 1:**
You would have preferred to go straight?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I would have preferred fewer turns. Why? Because too many turns can make people feel uneasy. If we keep turning, like going around in circles three times, I might start to feel dizzy.

**Speaker 1:**
So, the dizziness you mentioned is due to the route setup, not the driver's handling?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the multiple turns in the route caused that feeling.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think a driver can do to improve the passenger's experience on a route with many turns?

**Speaker 2:**
There's not much a driver can do. Maybe engage in some conversation to distract the passenger.

**Speaker 1:**
So, chatting to divert attention. What about the driving itself, like controlling the car?

**Speaker 2:**
I think the driver did a great job.

**Speaker 1:**
So, the driving was smooth?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because sometimes people appear at the turns. I think the driver braked smoothly and did a good job. Chatting might help distract from the turns.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel the deceleration was abrupt?

**Speaker 2:**
No, it was normal deceleration.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel the driver was speeding?

**Speaker 2:**
No, not at all. If I were taking a taxi, I would prefer the driver to maintain a steady pace.

**Speaker 1:**
There was a point where the driver had to avoid pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles. Did you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel the driver violated any traffic rules? When approaching the Golden Youth area, how did you feel with a tricycle on one side and a bicycle on the other?

**Speaker 2:**
During the day, I felt the driver handled it well. At night, it might be different. If it were nighttime, I might remind the driver about pedestrians ahead because visibility is lower.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think the driver should have stopped or slowed down to let others pass?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but the driver didn't need to because the intersection was wide enough.

**Speaker 1:**
Right.
**Speaker 1:** Should we stop or slow down to let the other car pass?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, but the driver didn't.

**Speaker 1:** Was it because the intersection was wide enough?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it was wide enough for the car to pass.

**Speaker 1:** From your perspective, the distance on both sides was sufficient, so there was no worry. What were you mainly focusing on as a passenger? What were you looking at?

**Speaker 2:** For example, was the road too congested?

**Speaker 1:** You were observing the traffic conditions, right? Looking ahead?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, and also checking if there were any pedestrians suddenly appearing at turns.

**Speaker 1:** So, during this drive, you were concerned about pedestrians suddenly appearing.

**Speaker 2:** I think there was a person at an intersection later on. He didn't suddenly appear, but the driver braked.

**Speaker 1:** You remember that spot, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, turn right, stay in the right lane, and turn right at the traffic light in 200 meters. Continue in the right lane and turn right at the green light, then immediately arrive at Nanjing West Point.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel dizzy when turning right?

**Speaker 2:** A little, but it was because we were constantly turning.

**Speaker 1:** So, you noticed the driver stopped voluntarily.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I think because it was a right turn, and even though the red light allows a right turn, the green light on the other side made it tricky.

**Speaker 1:** So, you think the driver did the right thing?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, the driver let the other car go first.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel on the flat, open road? Did you feel sleepy?

**Speaker 2:** A little, but it passed quickly. I didn't actually fall asleep, just dozed off a bit.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel on that stretch of road?

**Speaker 2:** It was smooth, safe, and comfortable.

**Speaker 1:** When you reached Beijing Store, did you notice the delivery truck nearby?

**Speaker 2:** I think I did. It was very noticeable because it was big, and the driver was going slow, so there was no risk of collision.

**Speaker 1:** The key factor was the speed.

**Speaker 2:** Yes.

**Speaker 1:** So, you weren't worried?

**Speaker 2:** No, I wasn't worried. The driver gave me a sense of steady driving.

**Speaker 1:** You felt the driver was stable, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I felt he wouldn't crash into others, even on busy roads.
**Speaker 1:**
So, you feel that the driver's condition is quite stable, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I think he won't crash into others on regular roads. However, if he suddenly brakes hard or drives very fast and then brakes suddenly, I might start to worry about such issues.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you worry about oncoming traffic? No, right? Is it because the distance is sufficient and the acceleration is slow enough?

**Speaker 2:**
I trust the driver's skills. Even if the cars are close, if the driver doesn't make way, it means he knows he can pass safely.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you generally trust the driver when making right turns. What factors do you consider to determine if you should trust the driver?

**Speaker 2:**
I look at his driving speed and how he handles braking. Some drivers brake very abruptly, which can be unsettling. If the speed is moderate and the braking is smooth, I feel more comfortable. If the driver takes turns too quickly, I might start to feel a bit dizzy, but not too much.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, let's see. Here we have a right turn coming up, and there aren't many cars on this road. How do you feel?

**Speaker 2:**
It feels quite smooth. I don't have any other particular feelings.

**Speaker 1:**
We're about to reach the destination, and you didn't feel any sudden movements, right?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't worry. I think the driver handled it well. The car on the left side was not an issue because we could easily pass the yellow line.

**Speaker 1:**
Now, we have a left turn coming up, which is relatively wide, and there are many cars on both sides. Where were you focusing at that moment?

**Speaker 2:**
I wasn't focusing on anything specific. I was just thinking about getting onto the main road.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you were thinking about the route, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I saw the cars, but I wasn't worried about collisions. I didn't feel unsafe.

**Speaker 1:**
We're about to reach Nanjing. 

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, we are approaching the destination. We will pass through the current traffic light and reach Nanjing in about 150 meters. At the end of this road, we will turn right to reach the destination.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you feel on this road?

**Speaker 2:**
It's quite smooth, nothing special.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it's still normal and smooth. What about this turn? Do you look back to check for oncoming cars?

**Speaker 2:**
At traffic light intersections, yes.

**Speaker 1:**
You mainly trust the driver's judgment, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's correct. Please stay in the leftmost lane and remember to make a U-turn at the traffic light to enter the auxiliary road.
**Speaker 1:** At the traffic light intersection, you need to make a U-turn.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I trust the driver's judgment.

**Speaker 1:** Please stay in the leftmost lane, remember to make a U-turn at the traffic light to enter the service road, and then turn right after 200 meters.

**Speaker 2:** Make a U-turn to enter the service road, then turn right after 200 meters.

**Speaker 1:** How do you feel about making a U-turn here?

**Speaker 2:** I find the traffic congestion a bit frustrating. Although it wasn't too long, it felt less direct compared to just making a turn earlier. There are cars moving in different directions here, some turning and some going straight. It feels a bit chaotic and could be managed better for safety.

**Speaker 1:** Earlier, did you press the handle here?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because the turns were quite complicated. The turns were very sharp, and it felt uncomfortable. There were too many turns in that area, making it a bit unpleasant.

**Speaker 1:** So, it's more about the road conditions, right? Do you think the driver's handling made you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** No, not really. It's more about the road conditions.

**Speaker 1:** Turn right after 200 meters.

**Speaker 2:** Turn right, then immediately keep left. Turn right, then immediately keep left.

**Speaker 1:** Turn left to enter the internal road following the road signs, then turn right to enter the internal road.

**Speaker 1:** After turning right, is this where the driver will park? I have a few more questions. Besides the scenarios marked with the handle, did you notice any dangerous maneuvers by the driver? How do you think driving can be made safer?

**Speaker 2:** Driving slower and the driver being more alert would help.

**Speaker 1:** Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, yielding to other vehicles, including electric bikes, would be good. Nothing else comes to mind.

**Speaker 1:** When you ride in someone else's car, what makes you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:** Sudden braking.

**Speaker 1:** Why does that make you feel unsafe? Are you afraid of being thrown forward?

**Speaker 2:** Not exactly. It's more about the risk of hitting a pedestrian if the driver brakes too late. Also, in heavy traffic, sudden braking can be dangerous.

**Speaker 1:** Hold on, let me note that down.

**Speaker 1:** So, you pressed the handle because you felt uncomfortable, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, a bit.

**Speaker 1:** Besides that, were there any other driving maneuvers that made you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** No, not really.

**Speaker 1:** How do you think driving can be made more comfortable for you as a passenger?

**Speaker 2:** Well, first of all...
**Speaker 1:**
When you're a passenger, what do you think a driver can do to give you a better riding experience?

**Speaker 2:**
First and foremost, I need to feel safe. It's not necessarily about driving slowly; the speed can be higher, but it should be consistent. Sometimes the driver goes fast, then suddenly slows down, or drives fast in heavy traffic, which doesn't feel safe. If the driver makes me feel secure, I trust them more.

**Speaker 1:**
So, in your view, comfort and safety are closely linked?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, absolutely.

**Speaker 1:**
Safety first, then comfort.

**Speaker 2:**
I also think the air conditioning could be set a bit lower. It’s more about psychological comfort.

**Speaker 1:**
Are you referring to the temperature in the car today? Actually, we try to maintain a consistent temperature for everyone, so there's not much flexibility.

**Speaker 2:**
No worries, I didn't feel hot. I just mean that generally, a lower temperature can make the ride more pleasant.

**Speaker 1:**
What behaviors from drivers make you uncomfortable when you're a passenger?

**Speaker 2:**
Smoking, for one. And in terms of driving, abrupt braking.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
As I mentioned earlier, inconsistent speeds.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think makes a good or professional driver?

**Speaker 2:**
Smooth driving.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think today's driver was smooth and safe?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, they were. Besides smooth and safe driving, is there anything else you think defines a good driver?

**Speaker 2:**
Being communicative.

**Speaker 1:**
Communicative?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but it depends. Some drivers like to chat, while others don't. A good driver can sense whether you want to talk or prefer to be left alone. If you want to chat, they engage; if not, they respect your space.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you consider yourself a new driver or an experienced one? What's the biggest difference between you and an experienced driver?

**Speaker 2:**
In areas with heavy traffic or complex roads, I worry about making mistakes or safety issues.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you worry about violations or safety concerns. Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
No, just the fear of accidents in high-risk areas.

**Speaker 1:**
Have you ever looked into autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really.

**Speaker 1:**
Have you ever experienced it?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I haven't.

**Speaker 1:**
Based on what you know about autonomous cars, do you think there are aspects where they can never be as safe as human drivers?

**Speaker 2:**
I think there are times when they might not be safe.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you elaborate?

**Speaker 2:**
Well, I feel that...
**Speaker 1:** What aspects do you think autonomous cars will never be able to handle as safely as humans?

**Speaker 2:** I think there are times when they might not be safe.

**Speaker 1:** Can you elaborate?

**Speaker 2:** There are some issues with their systems.

**Speaker 1:** System issues?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I can't fully trust them yet. Even though I know about features like automatic parking, if the car were to drive autonomously for the entire trip, I would worry that at some point the system might fail to recognize something, which could compromise safety. The speed at which these errors could occur might lead to accidents.

**Speaker 1:** Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** No, that's it. Do you think the recent trip was driven by a human or was it autonomous?

**Speaker 2:** It was driven by a human.

**Speaker 1:** Why do you think it was driven by a human?

**Speaker 2:** If it were autonomous, the four people in the car, especially the two in the front, might have been chatting since they wouldn't have anything to do.

**Speaker 1:** But in our experiment, talking is not allowed. 

**Speaker 2:** I know. It just felt like there was a person driving.

**Speaker 1:** Did it feel that way because of the hand movements and how they matched the car's actions?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, for example, the driver would slow down when needed and yield appropriately. It felt very intelligent.

**Speaker 1:** So, if the car were autonomous, it would seem overly intelligent, right? You think autonomous driving can't achieve that level yet?

**Speaker 2:** Exactly. Because there are different pedestrians and vehicles, and the system might not handle all situations perfectly.

**Speaker 1:** Now, let's assume it was actually autonomous driving, and the driver was just a safety officer pretending to drive. If you think about it that way, how does your experience compare to your usual experiences?

**Speaker 2:** So, it was autonomous driving?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, and the driver was pretending. How does that change your experience?

**Speaker 2:** It doesn't feel different. I just wish it were a bit faster.

**Speaker 1:** So, the feeling of the driver driving is similar to your usual taxi rides?

**Speaker 2:** Yes.

**Speaker 1:** As a pedestrian, when you approach an intersection without traffic lights, how do you judge the intentions of the drivers?

**Speaker 2:** You mean whether they will turn left or go straight?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, or whether they will yield to you. How do you judge that?

**Speaker 2:** Am I a passenger?

**Speaker 1:** No, you are a pedestrian.

**Speaker 2:** Oh, as a pedestrian. If the car is far away, I would go first.
Speaker 1:
How do you make your judgments?

Speaker 2:
Am I a passenger?

Speaker 1:
No, you are a pedestrian.

Speaker 2:
Oh, I see. If the car is still far away, I will go first. If it's already very close, I will let it pass. I also pay attention to the traffic lights. If it's green and the car is still at a distance, I will go ahead. I believe I can cross safely because I think if I wait, the car might hit me, which is a difficult situation.

Speaker 1:
So, you mainly judge based on distance. Do you also consider the speed of the car?

Speaker 2:
Yes, if the car is coming very fast, it will reach me quickly.

Speaker 1:
In such situations, do you move forward slowly to find an opportunity to cross, rush across, or wait until there are no cars?

Speaker 2:
It depends. As long as I feel it's safe to cross, I will go. I won't just rush across if it's not safe. I need to be sure that I can cross safely. If I feel confident, I will go.

Speaker 1:
So, it mainly depends on your subjective feeling of safety, right?

Speaker 2:
Yes, that's correct.

Speaker 1:
Alright, let me see if there are any other questions. No, that's all. Thank you for participating in our experiment today.

Speaker 2:
You're welcome.
