**Speaker 1:**
Can you say a few words? Hmm, okay.

**Speaker 1:**
First, I will ask you some questions about your usual travel experiences. Do you often travel by car? Long distances or short distances? Generally short distances. How long does a typical short trip take?

**Speaker 2:**
Usually less than 20 minutes.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, how do you feel about the vehicle and the driver's skills in this experiment? Are both the car and the driver good?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because I usually get car sick if the trip is over 20 minutes, but this car didn't make me feel very sick.

**Speaker 1:**
So, this car didn't make you feel very sick?

**Speaker 2:**
Just a little bit, but not to the point of feeling really sick.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you usually get car sick easily?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, just mildly.

**Speaker 1:**
Mildly, but if it exceeds 20 minutes, it gets worse?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, usually after 20 minutes, I start to feel a bit sick.

**Speaker 1:**
If you could choose, what type of car would you prefer? For example, an off-road vehicle, SUV, gasoline car, or electric car? Do you have a preference?

**Speaker 2:**
Electric car. 

**Speaker 1:**
Why?

**Speaker 2:**
Because it doesn't have the smell of gasoline cars.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it. Do you drive yourself?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I don't.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you have a driver's license?

**Speaker 2:**
No.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, let's review the video of your recent ride. I'll pause at certain points to ask about your feelings, and you can also point out any good or bad aspects of the driving. Let's start. How did you feel when the car made a right turn here?

**Speaker 2:**
I felt a bit dizzy.

**Speaker 1:**
A bit dizzy, right? Why do you think that is?

**Speaker 2:**
The car itself has a slight smell, and when it sways, it makes me feel a bit dizzy.

**Speaker 1:**
So, the car has a smell, and the swaying makes it worse?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you feel this way with all turns?

**Speaker 2:**
Mostly, yes.

**Speaker 1:**
Is it because you are sensitive to motion?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I'm quite sensitive to it.

**Speaker 1:**
But since the trips are short, it's not very serious?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it's very mild.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel when the car turned right onto the side road?

**Speaker 2:**
Similar to before, a bit dizzy during the turn.

**Speaker 1:**
And when merging onto the main road?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't feel much.
**Speaker 1:** How did you feel during the process? Did you feel a bit car sick like Cao Chen when turning? How did you feel when merging onto the main road?

**Speaker 2:** Generally, it's when the turns are quite sharp and there's a lot of movement.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel any discomfort?

**Speaker 2:** Earlier, there was a moment when a car braked heavily. That was a bit unsettling.

**Speaker 1:** Which part was that?

**Speaker 2:** We haven't reached it yet. My mom...

**Speaker 1:** Is it here or further ahead?

**Speaker 2:** Let's keep going. We should see it soon.

**Speaker 1:** Let me know when we get there. How did you feel about the U-turn process?

**Speaker 2:** Was it the sudden braking? I'm not sure which part it was, but there was a sudden brake.

**Speaker 1:** Didn't you feel the sudden brake here?

**Speaker 2:** I forgot. Was it here?

**Speaker 1:** Do you remember when you pressed the handle?

**Speaker 2:** I forgot to press the handle during the sudden brake, but then I remembered I had to press it once midway. So, I pressed it after a small turn.

**Speaker 1:** It's not mandatory to press it. You can press it if you want or not if you don't.

**Speaker 2:** But I forgot about the setting.

**Speaker 1:** If you remember later, just let me know. How did you feel about the U-turn process when you were in the car?

**Speaker 2:** The U-turn felt a bit like the turns, a little bit of car sickness.

**Speaker 1:** After the turn, there's a straight-line acceleration. How did you feel about that?

**Speaker 2:** It was okay, not much of a feeling.

**Speaker 1:** And during the steady-speed execution, how did you feel?

**Speaker 2:** It was quite good.

**Speaker 1:** What do you mean by quite good?

**Speaker 2:** The car was very stable.

**Speaker 1:** Very stable, and no hesitation?

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about the right turn? Was it similar to the previous turns?

**Speaker 2:** It should be lighter than the previous ones. It didn't seem like a sharp turn.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, it's lighter here, right? This turn is lighter than the previous ones.

**Speaker 2:** The previous one was over 60 degrees, maybe over 90 degrees.

**Speaker 1:** This one is also over 90 degrees.

**Speaker 2:** Are they the same?

**Speaker 1:** Didn't we just make a U-turn?

**Speaker 1:** So, you're saying this one feels better compared to the tutorial, right? Okay, hold on. The previous one was quite good. Is that right?

**Speaker 2:** It seemed like we were driving slower.

**Speaker 1:** This turn was slower. How did you feel as a passenger during this turn compared to the previous ones?

**Speaker 1:** Was it better because the speed was slower?
**Speaker 1:** How did you feel while riding in the car, especially during the turns? Was this turn better than the previous one?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it was better.

**Speaker 1:** Was it because the speed was slower? How did you feel about this turn compared to the last one?

**Speaker 2:** It was good, better than the last one.

**Speaker 1:** So, it wasn't as dizzying as the previous turn? You mean it was smoother?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it was similar to the previous recording.

**Speaker 1:** Oh, similar to the previous recording. How did you feel about this turn? Did you feel a bit dizzy?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, a little dizzy.

**Speaker 1:** Was the braking too sudden? Did you use the handle?

**Speaker 2:** I used the handle when we were about to stop.

**Speaker 1:** Was it intentional, or did you forget to use it once?

**Speaker 2:** I might have forgotten once.

**Speaker 1:** Was it this time?

**Speaker 2:** We'll see later. It might have been.

**Speaker 1:** Okay, we'll check later. How did you feel when passing through this intersection?

**Speaker 2:** No particular feeling.

**Speaker 1:** No particular feeling? No discomfort?

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about the right turn here?

**Speaker 2:** No particular feeling.

**Speaker 1:** No particular feeling. Okay.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about this turn?

**Speaker 2:** No particular feeling.

**Speaker 1:** How about the turns here? Any specific feelings?

**Speaker 2:** We've been in the car for a while now. How long has it been?

**Speaker 1:** We've been in the car for quite a while, so you might feel some discomfort. Does it have anything to do with the driver's handling?

**Speaker 2:** No, it's just the duration of the ride and the motion.

**Speaker 1:** Was the motion slow?

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about this turn?

**Speaker 2:** It was a small, sharp turn. The previous road had a similar turn.

**Speaker 1:** Any special feelings?

**Speaker 2:** No, nothing special.

**Speaker 1:** Okay, we'll stop the video here. The handle usage wasn't very clear, right? Was it the one just now?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because the later part wasn't clear.

**Speaker 1:** Was it mainly because of the sudden braking? Okay, let's ask some other questions. Besides what you mentioned, did the driver perform any dangerous maneuvers?

**Speaker 2:** No.

**Speaker 1:** Is there anything the driver could do to make you feel safer?

**Speaker 2:** No, nothing specific.
**Speaker 1:**
Is there anything that makes you feel unsafe when someone else is driving?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, when there are a lot of cars, especially when turning at intersections where you can't see if there are cars coming from the other side. Those blind spots make me feel uneasy.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it's the blind spots during turns that make you feel unsafe. Is there anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, when the roads are narrow, I always feel like the car might scrape against something.

**Speaker 1:**
I see. Did the driver do anything during the recent trip that made you uncomfortable? Do you think there are any improvements that could make the ride more comfortable for you?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the braking was a bit abrupt. Slowing down more gradually when turning would be better.

**Speaker 1:**
So, smoother braking and slower turns. When you ride in someone else's car, are there any behaviors from the driver that make you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
If the driver is aggressive or has a bad temper, it makes me uneasy. Also, if they drive too fast.

**Speaker 1:**
Aggressive driving and high speed, right? What do you think makes a good or professional driver?

**Speaker 2:**
A good driver is calm and drives steadily. They don't get easily agitated.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think is the biggest difference between a new driver and an experienced driver?

**Speaker 2:**
Experienced drivers are usually safer when there's no danger, but they can become careless in dangerous situations because they are too used to driving.

**Speaker 1:**
So, experienced drivers might be more careless in dangerous situations compared to new drivers?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, new drivers tend to be more cautious and take better care of the car.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think there are aspects of driving that autonomous cars will never be able to match human drivers in?

**Speaker 2:**
I think autonomous cars can't replace the human touch in certain situations. For example, they can't have conversations or make nuanced decisions like humans can.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think the recent trip was driven by a human or an autonomous car?

**Speaker 2:**
It felt like a human was driving. If it were an autonomous car, the turns would have been more precise and the braking more consistent.
**Speaker 1:**
Instead of being so urgent.

**Speaker 1:**
Adjust the brakes, apply the brakes.

**Speaker 2:**
The machine drives very punctually, I think. It's very precise. Unlike humans, who might get distracted, the machine definitely won't. So, it feels more reliable.

**Speaker 1:**
I see. Okay, let's assume that the car we just talked about was self-driving, and the driver was just sitting there. How do you think your riding experience would be different? Would it be more novel?

**Speaker 2:**
Personally, I feel it's safer than when a human is driving. When a human drives, they can sometimes get distracted.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you mean by that? Distracted?

**Speaker 1:**
And the last question is, let's assume you are a pedestrian crossing the street. Sometimes there are bicycles, electric scooters, and cars coming. How do you judge their intentions when crossing the street?

**Speaker 2:**
If there are no turn signals, you rely on the traffic lights.

**Speaker 1:**
Traffic lights, and?

**Speaker 2:**
Including their signals, and... hmm.

**Speaker 1:**
Windy, and?

**Speaker 2:**
That's it. Also, based on regular traffic rules.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you judge?

**Speaker 1:**
Which traffic rules help you determine the car's intentions?

**Speaker 2:**
Generally, they won't drive against traffic, and they won't skip signals.

**Speaker 1:**
For example, if this road doesn't allow driving against traffic, you might think the car will stop. Right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, and in common situations, you can judge if there's any danger.

**Speaker 1:**
Okay, we've almost finished our questions. Thank you for your time today.

**Speaker 2:**
You're welcome.
