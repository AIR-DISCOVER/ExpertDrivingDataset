**Speaker 1:**
Can you blow into this microphone?

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, we can start now. Before we watch the video, I want to ask you a few questions about your usual travel habits. Do you often travel by car?

**Speaker 2:**
Not particularly often, no.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you usually take long trips or short trips?

**Speaker 2:**
Mostly short trips.

**Speaker 1:**
How long do these trips usually take?

**Speaker 2:**
About 20 to 30 minutes.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about riding in our vehicle for this experiment?

**Speaker 2:**
It felt alright.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you find the driving skills of the driver?

**Speaker 2:**
The driving skills are okay, but the driver tends to accelerate and brake quite abruptly.

**Speaker 1:**
Does this affect your comfort during the ride? If you had to choose, what type of car do you prefer for traveling?

**Speaker 2:**
I prefer sedans.

**Speaker 1:**
Why do you prefer sedans?

**Speaker 2:**
They are more comfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you have a preference between gasoline cars and electric cars?

**Speaker 2:**
No, either gasoline or electric cars are fine.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you drive yourself?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I don't drive.

**Speaker 1:**
Next, I will play the video of our recent drive. While watching, if there are any moments where you feel a change in your experience, such as the driver doing something well or poorly, please let me know. I will also ask you about specific road conditions and segments. Are you ready?

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about the driver's start?

**Speaker 2:**
The start was fine, quite smooth, not too abrupt.

**Speaker 1:**
There were many turns when exiting the parking lot. How did the driver handle them?

**Speaker 2:**
Since I'm learning to drive, I would have slowed down more for the turns.

**Speaker 1:**
Did the driver slow down?

**Speaker 2:**
It didn't seem like it. The driver just coasted through the turns.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel dizzy from the turns?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really, it was okay.

**Speaker 1:**
We are about to start a 5.5 km journey, which will take approximately 18 minutes. In 90 meters, turn right at the end of the road, then turn right again at the next junction.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel anything special about this right turn?
**Speaker 1:** In 90 meters, turn right at the end of the road, then turn right again at the waypoint.

**Speaker 1:** How did that right turn feel?

**Speaker 2:** It didn't feel particularly special.

**Speaker 1:** So, it was just a normal turn, right? I might ask similar questions about turns frequently. If you think it's just normal driving, you can say it was normal driving near the waypoint.

**Speaker 1:** Over here, did you notice any electric bikes coming close to you? Did you feel that the scene was a bit dangerous when the car was starting, and we passed without slowing down or yielding? Did you notice that?

**Speaker 2:** No, I didn't.

**Speaker 1:** You didn't?

**Speaker 2:** Because when the car was starting, I assumed it would yield to us.

**Speaker 1:** You thought the other car would yield to us, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about driving on the auxiliary road overall?

**Speaker 1:** It was okay.

**Speaker 2:** Because the speed wasn't very high, it was manageable.

**Speaker 1:** So, you didn't feel it was very dangerous, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, we are about to enter the main road in 300 meters.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about merging onto the main road? It seemed a bit fast.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it was a bit fast. Do you think that was good or bad?

**Speaker 1:** I'm not sure. I checked the rearview mirror, but I think the car should have slowed down a bit before merging. It was a T-junction, and I felt the driver should have slowed down, checked for cars on the right, and then merged gradually.

**Speaker 1:** So, it should have been done step by step, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because merging directly like that poses a safety risk. An experienced driver might not pay attention to such details. Do you think this driver is experienced?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, from the way they drive, it seems they have some driving experience, but not as much as a professional driver.

**Speaker 2:** What details made you think that?

**Speaker 1:** I remember a traffic light where there was a cyclist on the right. The driver honked, and then there was another cyclist waiting. The driver judged the distance well and passed through smoothly, indicating some level of driving skill.

**Speaker 1:** So, they have some experience in judging distances. What about areas where they are less skilled?

**Speaker 2:** Possibly in parking and other similar maneuvers.
**Speaker 1:** There was definitely some amazement.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, he has some experience in judging the distance between cars. But there are areas where he is not very skilled.

**Speaker 1:** Like what?

**Speaker 2:** For example, when it comes to parking and decelerating, he tends to brake very abruptly. I feel that with more experience, or maybe it's just a personal habit, he would control the speed better in advance and not rely so much on sudden braking. The road segment is 250 meters long, so he should start slowing down earlier, especially when approaching a traffic light.

**Speaker 1:** Overall, it was quite smooth here. Let's move on.

**Speaker 2:** We are about to enter the main road.

**Speaker 1:** Did he cross the line here? He was quite close to the car on the right. If he crossed the line, he must have been very close to the car on the right. Do you remember?

**Speaker 2:** I don't remember exactly.

**Speaker 1:** It was up ahead. He wanted to make a U-turn and pressed the handle.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because he was following the car in front very closely. The car in front didn't make the turn, and there was oncoming traffic. It wasn't particularly dangerous, but it was a bit tense. He handled it well, though.

**Speaker 1:** It felt tense at the time. Yes, tense.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, especially since I had a parent with me, which made it harder to handle.

**Speaker 1:** I think the driver should have waited for the car in front to pass before making the turn. He shouldn't have been so close.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, in such situations, he should wait until he can make the turn in one go, rather than stopping at the intersection and then turning. It feels safer that way.

**Speaker 1:** Just now, he was very close to the car in front.

**Speaker 2:** Not particularly close. They were both moving in the same direction, so it wasn't likely to cause an accident.

**Speaker 1:** What do you mainly focus on when sitting in the passenger seat?

**Speaker 2:** The road conditions ahead and the right side mirror.

**Speaker 1:** Do you watch the driver? Did he accelerate?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, he accelerated and then decelerated. 

**Speaker 1:** And then turned right. I feel that this kind of classic maneuver on short roads is quite common.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, when we were making the turn.

**Speaker 1:** This right turn was quite normal. In 300 meters, we will reach the waypoint.

**Speaker 2:** We are about to reach the waypoint, and then turn right at the traffic light.

**Speaker 1:** Turn right. How did that turn feel?

**Speaker 2:** It felt...
**Speaker 1:**  
Turn right at the traffic light intersection. When you reach the classic point, then at the traffic light intersection.

**Speaker 2:**  
Turn right. How did that turn feel?

**Speaker 1:**  
It felt like there was a cyclist, um, it was a bit of a coincidence.

**Speaker 2:**  
Our radar also went off. How did the driver handle it? Even though the other party was forcing their way.

**Speaker 1:**  
The driver let them go. It was like they consciously decided to let them pass.

**Speaker 2:**  
There were quite a few people at that intersection. Did you feel a bit nervous at that moment?

**Speaker 1:**  
Not really. The driver was going relatively slow. Even though it was 400 meters to the destination, it wasn't too bad. The classic point was still a bit far. Did you say the driver accelerated on this kind of road?

**Speaker 2:**  
We were about to reach the classic point, then turn left at the end of the road, and then reach the destination.

**Speaker 1:**  
Turn left, then reach the destination. Was the left turn urgent?

**Speaker 2:**  
Which point are you referring to?

**Speaker 1:**  
It was a bit urgent.

**Speaker 2:**  
Well, it didn't feel like they accelerated. It was more like they were coasting. I didn't feel it was particularly tight, actually.

**Speaker 1:**  
Okay. Did you feel a bit worried in that scenario?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, actually a bit. Because when the electric bike came over, it wasn't particularly easy to notice. We also honked a bit.

**Speaker 1:**  
Right.

**Speaker 2:**  
Because of the electric bike, yes. It felt like it suddenly appeared.

**Speaker 1:**  
It seemed like it was trying to overtake the three cars on the right. The distance between the cars was quite narrow.

**Speaker 2:**  
So it shouldn't have tried to overtake.

**Speaker 1:**  
I felt it should have waited a bit since it was a tight situation. I felt it should have waited a bit.

**Speaker 2:**  
But there was a concern about safety. When we reached the classic point, then turned left. Is it here?

**Speaker 1:**  
Yes, because the car suddenly cut across, and it didn't seem to do a proper check. The parking was quite tight there.

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, it was very close. The braking was quite sharp, right? It was quite obvious, not extremely, but quite noticeable. The braking was a bit abrupt. We then reached the destination. 100 meters ahead, there was a traffic violation camera. Please be aware of the administrative regulations when driving in Beijing's administrative area.

**Speaker 1:**  
It seemed like there was a bit of acceleration on this road.

**Speaker 2:**  
We were about to reach the destination, then turn right. When we reached the classic point, then...

**Speaker 1:**  
Turn right here, you are...
**Speaker 1:** It seems like there's a bit of acceleration here on this stretch of road.

**Speaker 2:** We're about to reach the agricultural point, turn right soon. We'll arrive near the classic lake shortly after.

**Speaker 1:** Turn right here. Did you press the handle again up ahead?

**Speaker 2:** There should be a crossing here, yes, a diagonal one. The cars are quite close to each other.

**Speaker 1:** Is it here? Here. Anyway, it's still one.

**Speaker 2:** The road conditions are quite complex. There are many bicycles and electric scooters here, and they don't strictly follow traffic rules.

**Speaker 1:** So, we didn't slow down? It seems like we didn't slow down at this point.

**Speaker 2:** Turn right.

**Speaker 2:** Continue on the right lane. Turn right at the traffic light in 200 meters.

**Speaker 1:** It feels like we're moving towards the right lane.

**Speaker 2:** Turn right at the traffic light, then immediately proceed.

**Speaker 1:** I didn't notice the 4S shop.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it should be here. It seems like there was a car very close by, and it just drove past without checking.

**Speaker 1:** Is it here?

**Speaker 2:** Turn right, then immediately reach the waypoint.

**Speaker 1:** It was a bit dangerous. We'll reach the classic point in 300 meters. But he drove quite well on this stretch.

**Speaker 2:** We're about to reach the classic point, then turn right. We'll arrive near the waypoint shortly after, then turn right.

**Speaker 1:** Were you worried he might take the wrong route? How does this right turn feel? We're about to reach the destination. Did you notice if the driver's route matched the navigation?

**Speaker 2:** It should be consistent.

**Speaker 1:** How does it feel here? It's okay. It didn't seem that close from inside the car.

**Speaker 2:** The road near the southern point is quite narrow. Then turn right into Zhongguancun North Street.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel a bit worried when it got close?

**Speaker 2:** There's a photo spot 100 meters ahead.

**Speaker 1:** I can see the other driver is trying to let us pass. This is the road we just drove on.

**Speaker 2:** We'll reach the point soon, then turn left.

**Speaker 1:** Do you remember this place? We couldn't find it earlier.

**Speaker 2:** We had to return. This is Changfu Road.

**Speaker 1:** It feels like we're going in circles. Have we arrived?

**Speaker 2:** Near the classic point, then turn left. The driver might be a bit nervous at first, but he gradually relaxed as he got used to it.

**Speaker 1:** How could you tell he was nervous at the beginning?

**Speaker 2:** One sign was the braking...
**Speaker 1:**
How could you tell he was nervous at the beginning?

**Speaker 2:**
Well, one clear sign was his braking. Initially, he was braking very frequently, probably due to the complex road conditions. But as he got more comfortable, the frequency of his braking decreased significantly.

**Speaker 1:**
So, he managed to control his speed better as he went along?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. As we approached the waypoint, he was more relaxed and in control. We went straight through a traffic light, and about 150 meters later, we reached the waypoint. Then, at the end of the road, we made a right turn onto the main road.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel any bumps on the road as you entered the main road? Was the right turn smooth?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the main road was smooth, and the right turn was executed well. We continued on the main road, and about 400 meters later, we reached a U-turn point where there were pedestrians taking photos and someone on the phone.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you remember anything specific about that point?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, we were in the leftmost lane, and about 200 meters later, we made a U-turn at the traffic light and entered the side road.

**Speaker 1:**
How was the U-turn? Was it smooth?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was smooth. We waited for the oncoming cars to pass before making the turn.

**Speaker 1:**
Were there any issues with the car in front?

**Speaker 2:**
No, we kept to the left lane and made the right turn without any problems.

**Speaker 1:**
Were there any other dangerous maneuvers by the driver?

**Speaker 2:**
No, nothing else stood out as particularly dangerous.

**Speaker 1:**
What driving behaviors make you feel unsafe when you're a passenger?

**Speaker 2:**
Sudden braking is one of them.

**Speaker 1:**
Sudden braking? Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really.

**Speaker 1:**
Why do you think sudden braking is unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**
Sudden braking can indicate that the driver is either not paying attention or needs to make an abrupt maneuver, which can be dangerous.

**Speaker 1:**
Overall, what do you think makes driving safer? Did our driver today meet those standards?

**Speaker 2:**
Maintaining a safe distance and controlling speed are crucial. Yes, today's driver did a good job in those aspects.

**Speaker 1:**
Besides the instances you mentioned, did the driver do anything else that made you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
No, nothing else.

**Speaker 1:**
What driving behaviors generally make you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Not signaling when turning and sudden acceleration or deceleration.

**Speaker 1:**
Those are understandable concerns. Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
No, those are the main issues.
**Speaker 1:** In terms of dimensions, hmm.

**Speaker 2:** Not signaling when turning, hmm.

**Speaker 1:** That makes you feel uncomfortable psychologically, right? Hmm. Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** Then there's sudden acceleration and sudden braking.

**Speaker 1:** Anything else? Overall, what do you think makes driving more comfortable for you?

**Speaker 1:** Do you think safety and comfort are similar? I just asked about safety. Yes, they are quite similar.

**Speaker 2:** I would say so. Hmm, slowing down a bit, so you rarely need to brake. This way, it's both safe and comfortable.

**Speaker 1:** What do you think makes a driver a good or professional driver?

**Speaker 2:** Consistent speed. And...

**Speaker 1:** What do you think is the biggest difference between an experienced driver and a novice driver?

**Speaker 2:** Handling? First, the skill, hmm, and then the awareness of the surroundings.

**Speaker 1:** Have you ever learned about autonomous driving? No? Have you ever experienced it? Based on your understanding of autonomous driving, what aspects do you think it can never match human drivers?

**Speaker 2:** Handling emergencies? Hmm, it can't make preemptive judgments based on common sense.

**Speaker 1:** So, the adaptability of autonomous driving isn't very good. Right, hmm. Do you think the recent trip was driven by a human or by autonomous driving? Why do you think it was a human?

**Speaker 2:** Subjective judgment, whether it's a human driving. That's the first impression, that it's a human.

**Speaker 1:** Because a person is sitting there, right?

**Speaker 2:** And they are operating the vehicle? Hmm, and also...

**Speaker 2:** Like I mentioned earlier, the driver maneuvered between two vehicles. If it were a machine, it might consider that a risky move, but a human might do it to save time.

**Speaker 1:** Let's assume the scenario where an autonomous driving system is pretending to drive. If you think about it this way, how would it differ from your usual riding experience?

**Speaker 1:** You can look at some details. If it were autonomous driving, what details would make it look like autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:** Actually, I don't feel there's a significant difference.

**Speaker 1:** So, there's no difference from your usual riding experience. Hmm. When you cross an intersection on foot, assuming there's no traffic light, how do you judge the intentions of the approaching vehicles?

**Speaker 2:** One way is to look at the turn signals, hmm, and then the speed of the vehicle.

**Speaker 1:** How would you choose to cross in that situation?

**Speaker 2:** First, I would definitely yield, let the cars go first, hmm, then cross when the cars have passed or are far away, hmm, or if the driver signals me to go, hmm, then I would cross.

**Speaker 1:** Let me see if there are any other questions I haven't asked.

**Speaker 1:** Hmm, no, that's all for today.
Speaker 1: Or perhaps the driver, um, at this point I would...

Speaker 2: Let me see if there are any other questions we haven't covered.

Speaker 2: Hmm, no, that's all. We've finished our questions for today. Thank you for participating in our experiment.
