**Speaker 1:**
Xiao Hong, let me ask you a few questions about your daily commuting. Do you usually take long or short trips?

**Speaker 2:**
Short trips, I guess?

**Speaker 1:**
How long do these short trips usually take?

**Speaker 2:**
Typically less than an hour.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about the vehicle during this trip?

**Speaker 2:**
The air conditioning was a bit stuffy, and the driver braked a bit harshly at times, but overall it was okay. Also, you mentioned that the driver didn't use the turn signal.

**Speaker 1:**
So, the first issue is that the air conditioning was stuffy, and the second is that the driver braked harshly. You also mentioned that the driver didn't use the turn signal. Do you think the driver's skills were lacking?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, if the driver didn't use the turn signal, especially since I was sitting in the back, it might indicate a lack of adherence to traffic rules.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you feel the driver didn't follow traffic rules. If you had a choice, what type of car would you prefer? An SUV, a gasoline car, or an electric car?

**Speaker 2:**
An electric car, I think. 

**Speaker 1:**
Do you have any specific preferences for the car model?

**Speaker 2:**
No, as long as it's comfortable for passengers.

**Speaker 1:**
So, no specific model requirements, just comfort. Why would you choose an electric car?

**Speaker 2:**
Because its acceleration and braking are more responsive.

**Speaker 1:**
But I think that also depends on the driver.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it does, but compared to gasoline cars, electric cars generally have better braking performance and are more responsive.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you think electric cars are set up to brake more frequently. How do you feel about your own driving?

**Speaker 2:**
It's okay, I guess. Haha.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you encounter any issues when driving on the road?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really, but I do get nervous in traffic jams, especially when trying to merge. 

**Speaker 1:**
Why do you get nervous?

**Speaker 2:**
Because I'm afraid I won't be able to merge properly. There are so many cars, and I don't have much experience with traffic jams. I'm also worried that the cars behind me will get impatient.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you're afraid of not handling these situations well. Let's watch the video recording of the trip. If you have any thoughts or feelings at any point, feel free to share.

**Speaker 1:**
We'll pause at certain points to ask about your feelings. How did you feel when the car was making those turns?

**Speaker 2:**
I was very cautious and braked lightly. Sometimes, the braking was a bit harsh.
**Speaker 1:**
So, during that time, you were being quite cautious and tapping the brakes. Sometimes, though, it might have been a bit abrupt.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I felt that the braking was too abrupt, and the driver didn't consider the passengers' comfort when decelerating.

**Speaker 1:**
You think the driver was too fast when making turns?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but he was quite attentive to the cars on the left and right, as well as those behind.

**Speaker 1:**
So, how do you feel about the driver's safety measures when making turns?

**Speaker 2:**
Overall, it was good, except for not signaling properly.

**Speaker 1:**
Now, as you entered a side road, how did you feel? There are some non-motorized vehicles and bicycles on side roads. Did you pay special attention to the road conditions?

**Speaker 2:**
At that time, there were fewer vehicles.

**Speaker 2:**
If a car was too close to me, I might feel a bit nervous, but if there was some distance, it was fine.

**Speaker 1:**
During this trip, did you encounter any situations where cars were too close?

**Speaker 2:**
I don't think so. I was sitting on the left side, so I didn't notice any.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you didn't feel any bicycles coming close?

**Speaker 2:**
No, there weren't many.

**Speaker 1:**
But you felt the driver maintained a good distance from other vehicles. How did you feel about the driver's steady speed on this section?

**Speaker 2:**
It was fine, except when making U-turns.

**Speaker 1:**
Is that so?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but I'm not sure if he used the turn signals.

**Speaker 1:**
Is this the only part where you were unsure, or was it throughout the trip?

**Speaker 2:**
I was unsure throughout the trip, but I felt he didn't use the signals.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel anxious or nervous when you didn't hear the signal sound?

**Speaker 2:**
A little. I wanted to remind him but couldn't speak up.

**Speaker 1:**
You couldn't say anything?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I thought it might be a test vehicle, so I didn't say anything. If there were cars coming, I might have been scared, but without cars, I felt it wasn't my place to speak up. It's like when a passenger in the back seat sees something wrong, they might want to remind the driver but hold back.

**Speaker 1:**
So, if you noticed he didn't signal, would you pay more attention to his turns?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I would focus more on his turns.

**Speaker 1:**
You noticed he didn't signal from the beginning, so you paid special attention to the road conditions at each turn. How did he handle those turns?

**Speaker 2:**
He definitely slowed down, and...
**Speaker 1:** You always pay special attention to road conditions. How did Mengze handle it? Even though he didn't use the turn signal, how did he manage those situations?

**Speaker 2:** Well, he definitely slowed down and was aware of the following traffic.

**Speaker 1:** Did that make you feel any better?

**Speaker 2:** I think so.

**Speaker 1:** It's necessary, right? Even though you saw the driver paying attention, he didn't use the signal. How did that make you feel?

**Speaker 2:** I still felt a bit anxious.

**Speaker 1:** Were you worried that the car might get into trouble because of this?

**Speaker 2:** It seemed like the car's automatic braking system activated.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about that?

**Speaker 2:** I felt that it wasn't a big issue.

**Speaker 1:** So, you weren't very concerned about it. Right. What happened next?

**Speaker 2:** We got out of the car. I saw the driver being cautious, so I felt okay, but I was paying attention to that part.

**Speaker 1:** Did you check the cars behind you?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I looked to the right, but once I was on the road, I didn't check behind.

**Speaker 1:** You could check the rearview mirror in front.

**Speaker 2:** I did, but not frequently. When I was making a U-turn or on the right side, I would check the rearview mirror.

**Speaker 1:** The rearview mirror usually gives a good view. Did you check it?

**Speaker 2:** Not really. I think I didn't.

**Speaker 1:** So, you mainly focused on the right side of the road?

**Speaker 2:** Both sides, actually. Because I was in the back seat.

**Speaker 1:** But you were sitting on the left side. When do you usually focus on the right side? When making a right turn?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, when turning or performing other maneuvers.

**Speaker 1:** So, you look both ways. Do you think he maintained a safe distance?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, he did. His turns were quite smooth.

**Speaker 1:** Besides not using the turn signal, were there any other issues?

**Speaker 2:** Not really. There were fewer cars, and we were on a small road, so it was fine.

**Speaker 1:** How do you think he could drive more safely? The first thing is using the turn signal, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, and...

**Speaker 1:** Why didn't you use the handle? Although I asked downstairs, we need to record it here.

**Speaker 2:** I felt that although his driving was a bit aggressive, it wasn't uncomfortable to the extent that I needed to use the handle.

**Speaker 1:** What level of discomfort would make you use the handle?

**Speaker 2:** If he were to...
**Speaker 1:**
So, it wasn't uncomfortable to the point where you felt you had to press the efficiency button?

**Speaker 2:**
If I was leaning back in my seat and the braking caused me to lurch forward significantly, I would feel that the driver wasn't being smooth.

**Speaker 1:**
So, this driver didn't make you feel like the whole car was out of control?

**Speaker 2:**
No, it just made the car feel a bit jerky.

**Speaker 1:**
When you ride in other people's cars, what driving behaviors make you feel uneasy?

**Speaker 2:**
What behaviors? Generally?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, driving habits and maneuvers.

**Speaker 2:**
Not using turn signals is a big one for me. It's very dangerous, especially when there are fewer cars on the road. If it were busier, it would be even more unsafe, and I might press the button.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you might just press the handle. Do you usually remind the driver?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I do. Also, speeding or running red lights makes me uneasy. For example, if the light turns yellow and the driver speeds up to get through the intersection.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you do that when you drive?

**Speaker 2:**
I used to, but after being reminded often, I stopped doing it.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you usually drive with family or friends?

**Speaker 2:**
Mostly with family.

**Speaker 1:**
When you drive alone, do you have any concerns? Are you more cautious?

**Speaker 2:**
I might be more cautious when driving alone because I have to pay attention to everything myself. I worry about which route to take and whether I'm following traffic rules.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you use navigation systems often? Do they help you when you're driving alone?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, they help me check the road conditions. They usually offer assistance without me asking.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you pay attention to whether the driver follows traffic rules. What do you look out for?

**Speaker 2:**
I mainly watch their speed, especially when I'm in the passenger seat. Today, I didn't notice any speeding, and it seemed like the driver was going at a reasonable pace.

**Speaker 1:**
When driving through certain areas, do you worry about pedestrians or other cars suddenly appearing?

**Speaker 2:**
Not usually, but if there's a car parked on the side with its turn signal on, I get a bit worried that it might suddenly pull out.
**Speaker 1:** When you encounter a situation where a car is parked on both sides and the driver signals a left turn to pull out, do you feel concerned that they might suddenly come out?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. In such cases, I pay extra attention to maintaining a safe distance from pedestrians as well.

**Speaker 1:** Do you find this part of driving challenging or straightforward?

**Speaker 2:** I don't find it particularly simple or straightforward.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think the driver is attentive to your comfort during the ride? Do they make any special efforts to ensure you feel comfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, perhaps by controlling the speed well.

**Speaker 1:** You think they control the speed well, but do they brake too hard?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, sometimes the braking is a bit harsh.

**Speaker 1:** What could the driver do to make you feel more comfortable, aside from better braking control? Are there other aspects they could improve?

**Speaker 2:** Controlling the temperature inside the car, for example. Ensuring it's not too hot or too cold.

**Speaker 1:** Do you feel the driver is attentive to their surroundings?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, they seem quite attentive to the sides and rear. They adjust the mirrors frequently.

**Speaker 1:** What about pedestrian safety?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, sometimes when the signal is green for going straight, but the driver is turning right, they might not notice pedestrians crossing. In such cases, it's safer to wait.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think yielding to pedestrians is important?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, definitely. Yielding to pedestrians is always safer.

**Speaker 1:** Are there any other factors that affect your comfort?

**Speaker 2:** The driver's mood is important. If they are agitated, they might make rash decisions.

**Speaker 1:** Do you often get nervous while driving?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I tend to be a cautious and careful driver.

**Speaker 1:** Safety first, right?

**Speaker 2:** Exactly. For instance, in the earlier situation, the driver should have yielded to the pedestrian.

**Speaker 1:** But they didn't?

**Speaker 2:** No, they didn't. The pedestrian had to stop, and the driver continued driving.

**Speaker 1:** If you were driving, would you have stopped for the pedestrian?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I would have stopped and waited for them to cross. I think my driving habits are strongly influenced by my driving school training.
**Speaker 1:** When you're driving, do you notice and save the information about other cars around you?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I do. I feel that my driving habits are quite good, thanks to the driving school. It seems like there aren't many cars around here. Do you pay attention to the road conditions?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, I do. I feel more at ease on open roads.

**Speaker 1:** But do you notice if there are cars behind you when you change lanes?

**Speaker 2:** Actually, I feel like sometimes people don't pay attention to the cars behind them.

**Speaker 1:** Did you mention this in your feedback?

**Speaker 2:** No, I didn't. But at that moment, I felt relaxed because the road was quite empty.

**Speaker 1:** Did the driver use the turn signal when changing lanes?

**Speaker 2:** No, not when turning right or changing lanes.

**Speaker 1:** Were you concerned about that?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because the road was narrow and there were other cars ahead. But I felt the distance was safe, so I wasn't too worried.

**Speaker 1:** The driver wasn't going very fast, right?

**Speaker 1:** Do you think today's driving data is good? Feel free to evaluate it.

**Speaker 2:** If the driver didn't use the turn signal, I would consider that not fully qualified.

**Speaker 1:** Why do you think the driver didn't use the turn signal?

**Speaker 2:** Maybe they thought there were fewer cars on the smaller road and didn't see the need, especially if they were driving slowly.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think you should use the turn signal on an empty road?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because you can't guarantee that other fast-moving vehicles won't suddenly appear from behind or from other directions. If they don't notice your turn, it could lead to an accident.

**Speaker 1:** What kind of driver do you think this person is?

**Speaker 2:** If they didn't use the turn signal, I would consider them not fully qualified.

**Speaker 1:** Would you mark them as unqualified?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I would.

**Speaker 1:** Were there any sudden vehicles appearing?

**Speaker 2:** No, there weren't any sudden vehicles. The cars were mostly taxis temporarily parked on the right side.
**Speaker 1:** So, the vehicle that came out, it didn't suddenly appear, right?

**Speaker 2:** Actually, it didn't suddenly come out. Those vehicles were taxis temporarily parked on the right side, and they had their left turn signals on, preparing to move out, but they hadn't yet. I can't remember which road it was.

**Speaker 1:** Did our driver seem to yield?

**Speaker 2:** The taxi hadn't moved yet. We just turned the steering wheel and went ahead. Yes, we went first.

**Speaker 1:** I felt some bumps on the road, didn't you?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, there were some bumps. I noticed them earlier, but I didn't pay attention to them in the video.

**Speaker 1:** So, based on your experience, can you recall any specific part where it was particularly bumpy?

**Speaker 2:** Are you referring to the car on the right side earlier? It didn't seem too bumpy because we were driving on a typical road.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, in bumpy areas, the driver tends to brake more. Do you usually keep a safe distance when driving? How far do you think is safe?

**Speaker 2:** The driver maintained a good distance. I can't give you an exact number, but I think it was around 5 to 10 meters, maybe not exactly 5 to 15 meters. When stopping at a red light, this distance seems appropriate.

**Speaker 1:** On this road, do you pay attention to the bicycles on the right? There seem to be many.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I was watching the bicycles. The driver didn't rush to overtake them, which was good.

**Speaker 1:** I noticed a warning sign. Did the car shake a bit?

**Speaker 1:** Were you worried about the bus suddenly moving when we passed it?

**Speaker 2:** The bus had its hazard lights on, or maybe it was just parked. I was a bit concerned about the distance, but we passed it smoothly.

**Speaker 1:** So, our car was quite close to it, but it was fine.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, we passed it without any issues.

**Speaker 1:** Considering today's driver, do you think they were competent? What makes a good or professional driver in your opinion?

**Speaker 2:** I think the driver didn't use the turn signals properly. That's important to me.

**Speaker 1:** So, using turn signals is crucial for you. Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** A good driver should also be mindful of pedestrians and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles.
**Speaker 1:**
So, this point is still quite important to you. Right, and what else?

**Speaker 2:**
Well, I think a good driver, as you mentioned, should be mindful of pedestrians and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles, whether they are in front, behind, or on either side. Additionally, it's important to use the mirrors effectively, both inside and outside the car. Also, controlling the speed is crucial. I might be an overly cautious driver.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think there's a difference between you and an experienced driver?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, sometimes being overly cautious can lead to hesitation, which can actually increase safety risks. For example, when changing lanes, if you are not quick enough with the steering, it can affect the vehicles behind you in the lane you are moving into. This hesitation might cause the cars behind to brake suddenly, potentially leading to accidents. It's important to change lanes promptly while ensuring it's safe to do so.

**Speaker 1:**
So, what do you think makes you better than other new drivers?

**Speaker 2:**
I pay close attention to traffic rules and details. For instance, I am mindful of giving way to pedestrians and other vehicles, especially during busy times.

**Speaker 1:**
Have you ever looked into autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:**
I've heard about it, but I haven't studied it in detail. Have you experienced it? No, I haven't.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think are the limitations of autonomous vehicles compared to human drivers?

**Speaker 2:**
For example, detecting pedestrians. An autonomous vehicle might stop automatically when it detects a person, but it can't always determine if the person intends to cross the road or is just walking by. This judgment is something humans are better at.

**Speaker 1:**
What about in terms of vehicle behavior?

**Speaker 2:**
In traffic situations, like when there's a traffic jam, human drivers might bend the rules a bit to find a quicker route, even if it's not entirely polite. Autonomous vehicles, on the other hand, strictly follow traffic rules, which might put them at a disadvantage in heavy traffic because they won't take shortcuts or make quick decisions that a human might.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
In emergency situations, like when two cars are about to collide, the hardware and decision-making capabilities of autonomous vehicles might not be as effective as a human's quick reflexes.
**Speaker 1:**
Are there any other concerns?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, there are concerns about the hardware in emergency situations. For example, during a sudden encounter with another vehicle, the autonomous driving system might brake. I’m not sure if the system's responses in emergencies are comprehensive enough. It might brake in advance, but it could also brake too harshly or lack better solutions for avoiding collisions, like steering, especially on icy or snowy roads.

**Speaker 1:**
If you had the chance, would you want to experience autonomous driving as a driver or a passenger?

**Speaker 2:**
I would want to try both.

**Speaker 1:**
Would you trust an autonomous car?

**Speaker 2:**
I can't say without experiencing it first.

**Speaker 1:**
You just want to try it out, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, if I haven't tried it, saying I don't trust it would be a bit unfair.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think the recent drive was done by a human or by the autonomous system?

**Speaker 2:**
I think it was driven by a human.

**Speaker 1:**
What makes you think so?

**Speaker 2:**
If it wasn't a human, how could the braking be so abrupt?

**Speaker 1:**
So, the abrupt braking made you think it was a human driver. Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
Now that you mention it, I didn't pay close attention to the driver's actions, like shifting gears. So, I can't be sure if it was a human driving.

**Speaker 1:**
You can't be sure because you didn't observe the driver's actions closely, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I didn't closely observe the driver's hands or other movements.

**Speaker 1:**
If it was on autonomous mode and the driver was just a safety officer pretending to drive, how would that differ from your usual riding experience?

**Speaker 2:**
The speed would be more consistent and smoother, more average.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you think it would maintain a constant speed, like a machine setting?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it would feel very regulated.

**Speaker 1:**
These details make you think it might be a machine driving. One more question: as a pedestrian, when you cross an intersection without traffic lights, how do you judge the driver's intentions?

**Speaker 2:**
Mainly by the distance. If there's enough safe distance for me to cross, I don't worry much about the driver's intentions. But if the vehicle is close, I judge by whether it slows down or signals a turn.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you look at the driver's facial expressions?

**Speaker 2:**
I don't think facial expressions help much.

**Speaker 1:**
In such situations, how do you proceed?

**Speaker 2:**
If the vehicle is within a safe distance, I proceed cautiously.
Speaker 1:
In such a situation, how would you proceed?

Speaker 2:
Generally, if the other vehicle is already within a safe distance, I would let them go first.

Speaker 1:
So, you would let the other car go.

Speaker 2:
Yes, unless they have already stopped and are waiting for me. In that case, I would quickly proceed.

Speaker 1:
In heavy traffic, would you move forward, or would you wait based on the flow of traffic? For example, if some cars are moving slowly, would you move forward a bit and then stop?

Speaker 2:
Yes, if there is a lot of traffic but I need to cross the road urgently, I might move forward a bit to make the drivers notice me. Then, I would assess whether they intend to stop or slow down.

Speaker 1:
Alright, that covers all the questions. Our interview ends here. Thank you.

Speaker 2:
You're welcome.
