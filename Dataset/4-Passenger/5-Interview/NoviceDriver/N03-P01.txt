**Speaker 1:**
Let me start by asking you a few questions about your daily commuting habits. Do you often travel by car?

**Speaker 2:**
Not very often.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you usually walk or take the subway?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I mostly use public transportation like buses and subways. I rarely take taxis.

**Speaker 1:**
When you do take a car, is it usually for long or short trips? How long are the short trips, typically around 20 minutes? How did you feel about the experience of riding in our vehicle this time?

**Speaker 2:**
It felt pretty good, quite similar to taking a regular ride-hailing service like Didi.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it felt just like riding with a regular taxi driver?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, pretty much.

**Speaker 1:**
If you had to choose, what type of car would you prefer for your trips?

**Speaker 2:**
What type of car? Do you mean like a sedan or an SUV?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, or it could also be a gasoline car or an electric car.

**Speaker 2:**
I don't have a strong preference.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you notice any differences between gasoline cars and electric cars in terms of the riding experience?

**Speaker 2:**
Electric cars feel smoother, especially during acceleration, but the overall driving comfort is quite similar.

**Speaker 1:**
You drive yourself sometimes, right? How do you think you drive?

**Speaker 2:**
I think I drive quite cautiously. My driving is generally smooth, without sudden braking or acceleration.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, now we will play the video of the recent drive. If you notice any moments that change your experience, feel free to point them out. I might pause at certain points to ask about your feelings. Do you think the car accelerates quickly?

**Speaker 2:**
It's within an acceptable range.

**Speaker 1:**
How about the series of VR turns, including the right turn ahead?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't feel anything unusual. The car stayed within its lane, and I didn't feel like it was out of control.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you notice anything special about this segment?

**Speaker 2:**
The road conditions were quite complex, with bicycles turning into cars. And also...

**Speaker 1:**
Pedestrians. How do you think the driver handled it? Did you feel tense?

**Speaker 2:**
It was alright.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright.

**Speaker 2:**
There was one moment when I felt quite tense.

**Speaker 1:**
What specifically made you feel tense?

**Speaker 2:**
If the driver seemed flustered, looking around nervously, it would make me feel uneasy.
**Speaker 1:**
What specifically made you feel not nervous?

**Speaker 2:**
Well, if the driver himself is flustered and looking around nervously, it would transmit a sense of tension to me. But I noticed he was quite calm and steady, so I felt he must be experienced in handling such situations.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you think he maintained the distance from other cars and pedestrians?

**Speaker 2:**
I felt it was within a safe range. There was no risk of collision.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you have any special feelings during this part of the drive? Did you feel any acceleration?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, there was acceleration. It felt like he wasn't driving overly cautiously.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel the acceleration was smooth?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it felt smooth. Maybe later on, he drove more freely. There was a part where it felt a bit different.

**Speaker 1:**
Was it the part where he used the gear shift?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, from this angle, it did seem quite fast.

**Speaker 1:**
How about inside the car?

**Speaker 2:**
Inside the car, it didn't feel that way during that part.

**Speaker 1:**
When you were sitting in the passenger seat, which areas did you focus on? The front and the right side? You didn't look to the left?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I didn't look to the left.

**Speaker 1:**
Would you look to the left when making a left turn?

**Speaker 2:**
It seems like I didn't.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you didn't look to the left at all during the entire drive?

**Speaker 2:**
No, because the driver didn't seem flustered.

**Speaker 1:**
So, the driver's state is very important to you. Did you worry about hitting the bicycle over there?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't notice it. I was probably looking ahead and didn't see the bicycle on the right.

**Speaker 1:**
Did the driver slow down at that point?

**Speaker 2:**
I don't remember. I have no memory of it.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you don't know if the car had a buffering effect when slowing down or if the driver slowed down smoothly?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the deceleration and stopping didn't feel abrupt.

**Speaker 1:**
From this angle, it did seem like he was driving fast, but you didn't feel that way in the car?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I didn't feel that way in the car at that time. It was only later that I noticed some situations.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you look at the dashboard?

**Speaker 2:**
Not at all.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you didn't look at the dashboard during that part?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't.

**Speaker 1:**
Was it during the part where he used the gear shift?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but not during that part.

**Speaker 2:**
I felt like I should have pressed the handle during that part.

**Speaker 1:**
Was it during the recent part of the drive?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, during that part, there were no people or cars, but it felt like he was driving too fast.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you felt the acceleration was too obvious?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's why I pressed the handle.

**Speaker 1:**
Why did his acceleration make you want to press the handle? Were you worried?
**Speaker 1:** Really? Hmm, you felt it accelerate noticeably. Right, so you pressed the handle.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because the road conditions suddenly seemed simple, but I felt it wasn't the right time to accelerate suddenly.

**Speaker 1:** Why did his acceleration make you want to press the handle? Were you worried someone might suddenly appear?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because the road conditions suddenly seemed simple, but I felt it wasn't the right time to accelerate suddenly.

**Speaker 1:** Is it because that section of the road was more complex before?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, the road conditions were more complex.

**Speaker 1:** So you felt that section wasn't enough for him to let go and speed up.

**Speaker 2:** Right, it could still be complex, just not visible.

**Speaker 1:** What about this section?

**Speaker 2:** This section is better because the left side is open, and the right side has a clear view. The previous section only had one lane on each side.

**Speaker 1:** Did you pay attention to the right side of the road?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I pressed the handle because someone was about to cross.

**Speaker 1:** The person crossing the road, was it the elderly lady with the cart? So you felt the driver should have yielded to the pedestrian, and you pressed the handle.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, in the end, the pedestrian crossed first.

**Speaker 1:** But you still felt the driver should have been more proactive in yielding. Do you usually yield to others when you drive?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I do. It's the same road.

**Speaker 1:** I feel the speed is increasing. Were you worried? Did you feel it inside the car?

**Speaker 2:** This section definitely felt like a bug.

**Speaker 1:** So you pressed the handle because you felt scared when he started accelerating?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I felt he was driving too freely.

**Speaker 1:** Did you nervously check the road for people or cars?

**Speaker 2:** No, I wasn't that nervous.

**Speaker 1:** You just felt he shouldn't be driving like that.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I felt it was his driving habit, but not extremely dangerous.

**Speaker 1:** But it was still uncomfortable, so you pressed the handle. Todayâ€™s road conditions were good, not many cars. How did you feel about this section?

**Speaker 2:** It was okay.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel anything unusual in the car?

**Speaker 2:** No, it felt stable. Usually, when I take a taxi, I encounter fast drivers, and I choose to trust them because I'm already in the car.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think driving fast is good or bad?

**Speaker 2:** Personally, I prefer they don't drive so fast. There's no rush.

**Speaker 1:** It depends on the individual situation, right?

**Speaker 1:** So you pressed the handle because you felt he didn't yield to the pedestrian, and...
**Speaker 1:** Ultimately, we weren't in that much of a hurry.

**Speaker 1:** It mainly depends on the individual's situation, right?

**Speaker 1:** So, you pressed the handle once because you felt he didn't yield to pedestrians, and twice because you thought he was driving too fast. Did his speed make you feel unsafe or uncomfortable? 

**Speaker 2:** Unsafe. Not yielding to pedestrians is also a major issue.

**Speaker 1:** That's not good. Would you categorize it as unsafe or uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Uncomfortable. But aside from not yielding to pedestrians, his overall driving, like not hitting pedestrians and not braking too harshly, was okay.

**Speaker 1:** What do you think can be done to make driving safer?

**Speaker 2:** To make driving safer? From the driver's perspective.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, but if you have thoughts on road conditions, you can share those too.

**Speaker 2:** I feel drivers shouldn't treat driving like a game. There are many racing games, and some of my classmates play them. In games, you can crash without any real consequences, which can feel thrilling. But on the road, accelerating from 0 to 100 km/h in a few seconds is unrealistic and dangerous. Drivers need to treat real-life driving as it is, not like a game.

**Speaker 1:** Besides treating driving seriously, can you be more specific? For example, about changing lanes or following traffic rules?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I think following traffic rules is essential. Yielding to pedestrians is also a must. Additionally, constantly observing changes in road conditions is crucial.

**Speaker 1:** When you're a passenger in someone else's car, are there any other behaviors that make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:** Once, I took a ride with a driver who had his phone on the left for navigation and was watching short videos on the right phone. His hands were off the steering wheel, and he was smoking. It was the most reckless ride I've ever had.

**Speaker 1:** Did you say anything to him at the time?

**Speaker 2:** I usually don't confront drivers directly about smoking, watching videos, or making calls because I'm worried it might anger them. After all, I'm in their car, and they have control.

**Speaker 1:** Did you report this to the platform afterward?

**Speaker 2:** I gave him a low rating.

**Speaker 1:** Did he contact you to ask why you rated him poorly?

**Speaker 2:** No, he didn't. When I got into the car, I noticed his rating was already low, around 3.8 out of 5, while most ride-share cars have ratings above 4.
**Speaker 1:**  
So, how was your experience with the ride?

**Speaker 2:**  
I just got into the car, and its rating was quite average. Most of the cars I book have ratings around 4.5 to 5 stars, but this one only had a 3.8 rating.

**Speaker 1:**  
It seems like it was a bit of a gamble.

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, it was quite unusual. I was with my classmate.

**Speaker 1:**  
What makes a ride comfortable for you? For example, if the driver smokes, it might make you uncomfortable because of the smell, right?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, exactly. For me, a comfortable ride means smooth driving. I think the key is smooth acceleration. It's hard to define what sudden acceleration is, but I prefer no sudden movements at all. I want the ride to feel consistently smooth.

**Speaker 1:**  
So, smooth driving is important for comfort. What kind of driving behavior makes you uncomfortable? For instance, if the driver makes abrupt stops or accelerates suddenly?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, if the driver makes abrupt stops or accelerates suddenly, it can make me feel uncomfortable. If I get jolted forward by about 10 centimeters, that would definitely make me feel uneasy.

**Speaker 1:**  
So, maintaining a smooth ride is crucial for your comfort.

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, smoothness is the main thing.

**Speaker 1:**  
When you're in someone else's car, are there any specific behaviors from the driver that make you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**  
Talking on the phone.

**Speaker 1:**  
Talking on the phone? Does that make you worry about their focus?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, it distracts them. Even if their driving doesn't change, I worry that they might not brake in time.

**Speaker 1:**  
So, it makes you feel uneasy mentally.

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, I think talking on the phone definitely distracts them. In case of an emergency, their reaction time would be slower.

**Speaker 1:**  
So, you feel it's unsafe. What do you think makes a good or professional driver?

**Speaker 2:**  
First, they need to focus on driving. They should also be experienced and not a novice. And, of course, they should drive smoothly.

**Speaker 1:**  
Do you consider yourself an experienced driver?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, I think so.

**Speaker 1:**  
What do you think is the biggest difference between you and a novice driver?

**Speaker 2:**  
I think I am less nervous on the road and more aware of the car's dimensions, like the position of the four wheels and the overall length and width of the car.

**Speaker 1:**  
The driver we just had wasn't a novice, right? He had a few years of driving experience. We also asked you about your views on autonomous driving about ten years ago. What do you think are the aspects where autonomous cars will always...
**Speaker 1:** How many years of driving experience does the driver have? We asked you about your views on autonomous driving 10 years ago. Which aspects do you think autonomous cars will never be able to handle like humans?

**Speaker 2:** They will never be able to handle things like humans. Autonomous driving is based on many cases and experiences, but it can't predict every situation it has never encountered before. In real life, unexpected situations can happen at any time, and in those moments, it might not be as reliable.

**Speaker 1:** So, it can't handle complex situations as flexibly as a human can. Do you think the recent drive was done by a human or an autonomous system?

**Speaker 2:** It felt like a human was driving.

**Speaker 1:** Why do you think so?

**Speaker 2:** The acceleration felt very personal. At first, it seemed a bit restrained, but later it became more free and had a distinct personal style. It was quite obvious that it was a human.

**Speaker 1:** So, it was very different from the autonomous driving features you've experienced before?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, you can tell it was a human driving.

**Speaker 1:** And autonomous cruise control is more stable, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, with autonomous cruise control, acceleration and deceleration are smoother and don't have the sudden forward or backward movements that a human might cause.

**Speaker 1:** So, the driver had those noticeable accelerations?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, there were a couple of quick accelerations that made it clear it was a human.

**Speaker 1:** If the vehicle was actually on autonomous mode and the driver was just pretending to drive, how would that compare to your usual experience?

**Speaker 2:** Compared to my experience, it would be quite scary. There wouldn't be any details that make it feel like a machine is driving.

**Speaker 1:** As a pedestrian, how do you judge a driver's intentions at an intersection without traffic lights?

**Speaker 2:** I look at the car's speed and whether it is slowing down.

**Speaker 1:** So, you only look at the car's speed?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, just the speed. If the driver uses the turn signal, I also check for that.

**Speaker 1:** Do you look through the window to see the driver's face or expression?

**Speaker 2:** No, usually you can't see that.

**Speaker 1:** In such situations, how do you cross the road?

**Speaker 2:** I would wait until it's safe to cross, usually by waiting for a gap in traffic.

**Speaker 1:** If there are many cars, would you wait until there are no cars, or would you cross slowly?

**Speaker 2:** I would wait until there are no cars.
**Speaker 1:**
So, if you need to make a right turn immediately, what would you do?

**Speaker 2:**
If it's just me, I would wait until there are no cars and then make the turn. If there are a lot of cars, I would slowly move forward and look for an opportunity to go. If I'm with a group of people, I would follow their lead and turn when they do.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, that concludes our interview for today. Thank you for participating in our experiment.

**Speaker 2:**
You're welcome.
