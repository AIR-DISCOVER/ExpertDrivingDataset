**Speaker 1:**
Before we start watching the video, I’d like to ask you a few questions about your usual travel habits. Do you often travel by car?

**Speaker 2:**
Occasionally, yes.

**Speaker 1:**
Is it usually for long trips or short trips?

**Speaker 2:**
Mostly short trips.

**Speaker 1:**
Because I work in exhibitions. So, from my home to the exhibition center, how long does it usually take?

**Speaker 2:**
About 40 minutes.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about the ride during this experiment?

**Speaker 2:**
Overall, it was quite good.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you rate the driver's skills?

**Speaker 1:**
If you had to choose, what type of car would you prefer for travel?

**Speaker 2:**
Are you asking about human-driven or self-driving cars?

**Speaker 1:**
I mean the brand, as a passenger.

**Speaker 2:**
If there were a mature self-driving car, I would consider it. As for brands, I prefer BYD Qin.

**Speaker 1:**
You have a particular fondness for it.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, BYD Qin offers a very comfortable experience for passengers, both in terms of exterior and interior.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you have any preference for the type of fuel the car uses?

**Speaker 2:**
I prefer hybrid cars for now. If clean energy options like solar power become viable, that would be ideal.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you drive yourself?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I don’t drive.

**Speaker 1:**
So, regarding the type of car you prefer for travel, do you prefer gasoline or electric cars?

**Speaker 2:**
It depends on the region. In the south, electric cars are acceptable. In the north, especially in winter, I wouldn’t choose an electric car.

**Speaker 1:**
Next, I will play the video we just discussed. While watching, if you notice any moments that affect your experience, please let me know. For example, if you think the driver didn’t handle a particular situation well, feel free to mention it. What did you feel when the driver started the car?

**Speaker 2:**
It felt very stable. The atmosphere was good, and everything else was fine.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about the driver navigating through the parking lot with many turns?

**Speaker 2:**
It felt normal and compliant with the rules.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you notice anything special about the right turn?

**Speaker 2:**
No, it felt normal and reassuring.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else that stood out?

**Speaker 2:**
Just the last sudden stop, which was a bit unexpected.
**Speaker 1:**
How did the right turn feel? Was there anything special about it, or was it just to ensure safety?

**Speaker 2:**
It felt quite normal. Except for that sudden movement at the end, which caught me off guard. Other than that, it was fine.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you think the driver handled the section on the side road?

**Speaker 2:**
There were some issues with the car's handling.

**Speaker 1:**
The speed was average. Do you think it could have been a bit faster? Did you feel uncomfortable because it was too slow?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't feel uncomfortable. It felt safe.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, safety is important.

**Speaker 2:**
We are testing, after all.

**Speaker 1:**
How about when merging onto the main road?

**Speaker 2:**
It was fine.

**Speaker 1:**
No anxiety? Did you check for cars behind you?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't look to the sides or behind; I was focused on the front.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you check the right side?

**Speaker 2:**
The driver was checking both sides, so I just focused on the front.

**Speaker 1:**
How did this section of the road feel?

**Speaker 2:**
The driving was fine.

**Speaker 1:**
So far, everything seems normal.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but the temperature inside the car was a bit high, making me feel sleepy.

**Speaker 1:**
The car's temperature was too high?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it made me feel drowsy, almost like I was dreaming, in a half-awake state.

**Speaker 1:**
How was the U-turn? Did it feel normal?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was quite normal. The driver was young and handled it well, though he seemed a bit tense.

**Speaker 1:**
How does this parking experience compare to your usual taxi rides?

**Speaker 2:**
An experienced driver would probably drive faster and try to save time. Our driver didn't rush or take risks, which is different from regular taxi drivers who are often in a hurry to pick up the next fare.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it was steadier and slower than usual?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. The turns and intersections felt normal too.

**Speaker 1:**
Did the slower pace make you feel sleepy?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, especially when the temperature was high. It got a bit better later on.

**Speaker 2:**
The video demonstration was clear. The driver was cautious.

**Speaker 1:**
Was it just now or earlier?

**Speaker 2:**
It was later. Did you feel the right turn was too fast?

**Speaker 2:**
No, it was fine. The driver usually takes wide turns, so it felt slow.
**Speaker 1:** When you turn right, do you feel like the turn is too fast?

**Speaker 2:** No, it's fine. I think it's okay. The driver usually handles wide turns, so it's slower. If it were another driver, they might have taken the turn more quickly.

**Speaker 1:** When the driver slows down before turning, do you feel like they brake too suddenly?

**Speaker 2:** No, not at all. It's smooth.

**Speaker 1:** Earlier, there was an electric bike. Did you feel it was dangerous at that moment?

**Speaker 2:** No, it was quite far away.

**Speaker 1:** Even though you don't drive, you seem to have a good sense of these things.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I don't drive because my eyesight might limit me, so I decided not to drive. But I still pay attention to these details.

**Speaker 1:** I see. When you are a passenger, what kind of driving style do you prefer?

**Speaker 2:** I prefer male drivers who like to chat. If the driver doesn't talk, I feel uncomfortable. But if I talk too much, the driver might get annoyed. I like drivers who are a bit humorous and have good driving skills. I don't have high demands, but I appreciate a steady driver. I've had young drivers who were in a hurry, and that made me uncomfortable. The same goes for bus rides; if the driver brakes too suddenly, it causes a jolt, and passengers get thrown forward. That sudden stop can be quite jarring.

**Speaker 1:** So, you prefer a smoother ride?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. A smooth ride is best.

**Speaker 1:** What about driving speed?

**Speaker 2:** I prefer a bit faster because I usually have things to do. When I take a taxi, I need speed and punctuality, whether it's day or night. In my line of work, I need to arrive before meetings start, so I often take taxis. At night, I want to get home quickly to sleep, or get to a hotel if I'm working late. Sometimes I have early morning commitments too.

**Speaker 1:** Understood.

**Speaker 2:** Everything else is fine as long as the speed is reasonable.

**Speaker 1:** That makes sense.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because the speed shouldn't be too fast. I've seen crash test videos where they intentionally crash cars with people inside to test safety.

**Speaker 1:** Turning left here seems normal. Did you feel a bump or did something fall?

**Speaker 2:** No, I didn't feel any bump.

**Speaker 1:** Okay. Are the pedestrians far enough away?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, they are.
**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel any bumps?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was quite noticeable. Was it just the whiteboard?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes. Did you plan to keep a safe distance from the pedestrians here? 

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I did. The turn was very smooth.

**Speaker 1:**
As you mentioned earlier, if it were another training comparison, the angle would be smaller. This one has a larger angle, so it feels smoother.

**Speaker 2:**
This section of the road felt a bit bumpy, didn't it?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, that's a problem with the road.

**Speaker 2:**
Did the driver slow down and pay attention?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, the speed wasn't too fast. I felt it was okay.

**Speaker 2:**
Were you worried at that moment?

**Speaker 1:**
No, not at all.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the speed was controllable and predictable.

**Speaker 1:**
Exactly, because we were driving slowly, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, our speed was slow, and so was the other side's. There were no signs of danger.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think the driver is skilled?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, he seems quite experienced. Even though he was carrying a lot of stuff, he handled it well. It was very hot, and he must have felt it even more than I did. Driving in such hot weather is a big challenge.

**Speaker 1:**
Was the distance close at that time?

**Speaker 2:**
It was within a controllable range.

**Speaker 1:**
What is the controllable range for you?

**Speaker 2:**
About 30-50 centimeters.

**Speaker 1:**
Sorry, I clicked the wrong spot. Was it here?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was fine. There were many villagers on the road at that time.

**Speaker 1:**
Usually, we don't expect much competition, but there are many delivery guys outside.

**Speaker 2:**
Turning right here is still normal, right?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, he handles every turn well.

**Speaker 2:**
Did you feel any danger here?

**Speaker 1:**
No, it was the same here.

**Speaker 2:**
Do you get nervous on such roads?

**Speaker 1:**
No, not really. There are some cars on both sides, but I trust our driver. If he sees any danger, he will alert us.

**Speaker 2:**
What temperature inside the car would make you feel less drowsy?

**Speaker 1:**
About 5 degrees lower.

**Speaker 2:**
The current temperature is too high.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think the temperature inside the car is?

**Speaker 2:**
Above 40 degrees.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think the temperature is above 40 degrees?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it's quite high.

**Speaker 1:**
Are you afraid the driver might get drowsy?

**Speaker 2:**
No, he won't. Even if it's hot, he won't dare to get drowsy. It's a professional habit. Once a driver, always a driver.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think he is professional?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, he is very professional.
**Speaker 1:** Do drivers also get sleepy?

**Speaker 2:** Well, they shouldn't. No matter how hot it gets, they can't afford to be sleepy. It's a professional habit. Anyone who's been a driver knows this.

**Speaker 1:** So, it's unacceptable for them to get sleepy. You think he's a professional driver, right? You believe he's experienced.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. Since he's driving, he must have some driving experience. From what I know, drivers have their ways to stay alert, like pinching themselves. Especially for long-distance drivers, they have to keep going to make money, even if it means driving while tired. They use various methods to stay awake and alert.

**Speaker 1:** But this trip isn't very long, right?

**Speaker 2:** No, it's not.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel any danger at any point?

**Speaker 2:** There was a moment when the driver might not have noticed a parked car. We came close, and I felt a jolt.

**Speaker 1:** So, the car stopped suddenly?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, and I felt myself lurch forward a bit.

**Speaker 1:** That sounds quite noticeable.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it was very noticeable. I felt it clearly.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel it was dangerous at that moment?

**Speaker 2:** Not really dangerous, but it was uncomfortable. The driver might not have seen the car, and he seemed a bit flustered. It startled me a bit.

**Speaker 1:** So, it was uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I lurched forward, which I hadn't felt before.

**Speaker 1:** Did it wake you up suddenly?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it startled me. But it was just a small bump, nothing major.

**Speaker 1:** So, small bumps don't really affect you?

**Speaker 2:** No, during our evaluations, we consider small bumps insignificant. They don't cause much concern.

**Speaker 1:** How does the temperature inside the car compare to outside? Is it just as hot?

**Speaker 2:** It's a closed environment, so it feels hotter. If we could open the windows, it would be better, but since you're recording, that's not allowed. The closed environment can make people feel uneasy. When you're driving yourself, at least you can control the situation.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel any sudden acceleration?

**Speaker 2:** It seemed like there was a bit.

**Speaker 1:** But overall, it was smooth?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, the driver was quite steady.

**Speaker 1:** So, you think the driving was stable?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, if we were to hire a taxi driver for a long trip, they might drive faster without any prompts. But this driver was steady, even without speed restrictions.
**Speaker 1:** In her case, if she drives freely, she will drive much faster. Even though she was informed that there was no speed limit, the driver was already driving very slowly.

**Speaker 2:** Ideally, we also want the driver to drive as they normally would.

**Speaker 1:** But, actually, it might be better if you don't inform them about certain things. If you really want to test a genuine driving state, it might be better not to give them any hints. However, with all the equipment on their head, it already affects them. It's hard to replicate their usual state. Maybe next time, you could find some older drivers who might not be as easily influenced.

**Speaker 2:** Also, younger drivers might be more relaxed, but they might not communicate as easily. Their driving might be more cautious because of their inexperience. If you find older drivers, they might perform better. Or, if you have the resources, you could find some military drivers. Their driving skills are more refined due to their extensive experience.

**Speaker 1:** Actually, we have recruited many different types of drivers.

**Speaker 2:** I feel that different types of drivers can provide you with a variety of data.

**Speaker 1:** So, today's driver was more stable compared to the drivers you usually encounter.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, more stable and smoother.

**Speaker 1:** If you weren't taking a ride for work, what kind of driving style would you prefer?

**Speaker 2:** Hmm, still...

**Speaker 1:** Faster, you prefer a faster and more relaxed style?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, faster. After chatting with the driver, no matter where we go, everyone is happy to communicate. If the driver is willing, I can chat with them about topics they are interested in throughout the journey. It shouldn't be forced or awkward.

**Speaker 1:** I'll skip this part.

**Speaker 2:** We've done real road tests, new car experience tests, tire tests, and high-speed rotation tests. We've participated in various tests ourselves. So, the speed is definitely influenced by our surroundings because the driver has to be cautious.

**Speaker 2:** If the route chosen, like the one in Shougang, has almost no traffic, the speed can definitely increase. You don't want it to be too slow, as it might not provide comprehensive data. Maybe during weekends, or times with fewer people, or during holidays, you can test under different road conditions.
**Speaker 1:**
So, how did you feel about making a U-turn here? Was there anything special about it?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really. It was just a normal U-turn.

**Speaker 1:**
How about parking afterwards? Did you notice anything?

**Speaker 2:**
Well, there were a couple of points during the test. If it wasn't a test, I would have definitely said something, haha.

**Speaker 1:**
How did he park? Did he do it well?

**Speaker 2:**
I felt that there were some issues with the parking, especially in the second part of the test.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you think he didn't park well?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. I felt that the parking wasn't up to the mark. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I felt it should have been smoother.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, let's move on to the next part of the video. We have some other questions. Besides the scenario with the marked handle, were there any other dangerous maneuvers by the driver?

**Speaker 2:**
No, nothing else stood out.

**Speaker 1:**
Okay. When you ride in other people's cars, are there any situations that make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**
Smoking.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you elaborate?

**Speaker 2:**
When I take a ride-hailing service like Didi, it's usually better because it's official and they don't smoke. But with some private or unlicensed cars, the driver might smoke. They usually ask if it's okay, and I don't want to refuse and make them unhappy, so I just let them.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it's not just about the smoking itself?

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly. It's not just about the smoking. It's also about the distraction it causes. Smoking can make the driver less focused, which is a safety concern. Plus, I personally dislike the smell of smoke, but I don't want to upset the driver by refusing.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you feel unsafe because smoking can be distracting for the driver?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's right. There's always a chance that the driver might get distracted. And if I refuse, the driver might get upset, which could also affect their driving. Usually, my rides are short and during times when traffic is light, so I tolerate it.

**Speaker 1:**
Are there any other situations that make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**
Like you mentioned earlier, sometimes there are school children around. Whether I'm in a car or walking, children can be unpredictable. You never know what they might do next.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it's the presence of children that concerns you?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, especially when there are groups of children. It's not about the driver's actions but the unpredictability of the children.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it's more about the children's behavior than the driver's?

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly. It's the uncertainty of what the children might do, not the driver's actions.
**Speaker 1:**
Is it related to the driver's operation, or is it something else?

**Speaker 2:**
It's more about the unpredictability of children, not the driver.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it has nothing to do with the driver?

**Speaker 2:**
Correct. Children often don't know what they're going to do. Some kids don't even see the car because their attention is elsewhere, and they might run around carelessly. This can lead to situations where the driver feels a bit anxious or uneasy.

**Speaker 1:**
What situations make you feel unsafe with a driver?

**Speaker 2:**
For example, some drivers pursue speed. When the speed reaches a certain level, like over 80 mph, it can make me feel uneasy. I can accept 60 mph, but anything higher makes me more uncomfortable. On the highway, 100, 120 mph is normal, even 140 or 160 mph can be acceptable. But on regular roads, 80 mph is already quite fast.

**Speaker 1:**
Are there any other behaviors?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, there are. For instance, some drivers might have tattoos or piercings, which can give off an uneasy signal to some people. It's a cultural thing; some people can accept it, but I can't. Also, when I take a taxi, I prefer to be alone, but sometimes the driver might have friends or family with them, which can make me uncomfortable. I prefer a private ride.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think makes driving safer, in terms of driving habits?

**Speaker 2:**
Firstly, being more focused is important. Secondly, the speed shouldn't be too slow but should remain within a controllable range.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think today's driver's speed was within that range?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but it was a bit slow overall. If the driver had maintained a speed between 40-60 mph from the start, it would have felt better. The driver was very cautious.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't notice what our driver was wearing, but some drivers, like me, might drive in slippers, which isn't safe. For women, driving in high heels is particularly unsafe. It's best to have a pair of driving shoes in the car, like sneakers. Also, some drivers keep lighters in the car, which is unsafe, and strong perfumes can be distracting.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, besides the handle you mentioned, is there anything else?
**Speaker 1:**
Alright, besides the issue with the handle, are there any other actions by the driver that make you feel uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
No, not really. But I think driving a bit faster and having better communication would make me feel more comfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
What behaviors from drivers make you uncomfortable when you usually take a taxi?

**Speaker 2:**
Sometimes drivers use a lot of foul language, which really bothers me. Everyone has different habits, and some drivers speak very loudly, especially the older ones. They might be hard of hearing, but I'm not, and it can be hard to tolerate.

**Speaker 1:**
What about their driving?

**Speaker 2:**
As I mentioned, sudden sharp turns can be problematic. If the road conditions are normal, it's fine, but if not, it can be dangerous. Sudden turns can make me feel unsafe.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, sometimes. I remember once we had a minor collision. It wasn't serious, but it was still a bit unsettling.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think makes a good or professional driver?

**Speaker 2:**
Firstly, they should consider the passengers. Secondly, they should maintain a controllable speed—not too slow, not too fast. They should also continuously improve their skills and knowledge. If they are professional, they should focus on their driving habits, like not keeping lighters or perfumes in the car, especially in summer, as these can be safety hazards. Additionally, they should have essentials like chargers and interesting accessories to enhance the passenger experience. They should also carry necessary repair tools and a spare tire to handle any unexpected situations. This shows they are prepared and considerate of their passengers' safety and comfort.
**Speaker 1:**
Are there any specific concerns you have about the vehicle's repair system and what might happen if something goes wrong? If the vehicle isn't fully equipped, it could cause issues for both the driver and the passengers, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. The vehicle should be fully equipped with all necessary tools and parts. It would be even better if the driver is knowledgeable and not reliant solely on navigation systems. Some drivers depend entirely on GPS, but I believe a good driver should also be familiar with the routes. Relying solely on navigation isn't always ideal, especially in areas where GPS might not be reliable.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think is the biggest difference between experienced drivers and new drivers?

**Speaker 2:**
New drivers tend to be very nervous and overly focused on the steering wheel. When you talk to them, they might get even more anxious. They worry a lot, even if they are doing well. Experience helps in building confidence and better decision-making.

**Speaker 1:**
Have you ever experienced autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I have. I've tried it twice with a service called "Luobo." It's quite innovative and useful in a controlled environment. However, in an open environment, there are too many variables and blind spots that the system can't handle. For example, the cameras might miss smaller objects, which could lead to dangerous situations.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you compare autonomous driving to human drivers?

**Speaker 2:**
I still find human drivers more reliable. The recognition systems in autonomous vehicles can miss certain objects based on their size or lighting conditions. In a well-maintained area, autonomous driving might work fine, but in complex situations, it can be problematic. For instance, an experienced driver would instinctively slow down when they see a large truck, but an autonomous vehicle might not have that awareness unless explicitly programmed. This lack of instinct can lead to dangerous situations.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you believe human drivers are better at anticipating and reacting to unexpected situations?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. AI systems recognize vehicles but might not understand the behavior patterns of different drivers. Human drivers can anticipate and react to the actions of other drivers, which is something AI still struggles with.
**Speaker 1:**
Do you think the car was being driven by the driver or was it on autopilot during our trip?

**Speaker 2:**
Oh, I hadn't really thought about it. I always assumed it was the driver. I didn't think it was on autopilot. From the moment I got in, I just assumed he was driving, and I didn't pay much attention after that.

**Speaker 1:**
If the car was indeed on autopilot and the driver was just a safety officer pretending to drive, how would that compare to your usual riding experience?

**Speaker 2:**
It felt very realistic and good. Other autonomous vehicles I've experienced are similar, but they don't have as many features because they are already in operation. Our system is different; some have safety features, and some don't.

**Speaker 1:**
Were there any details that made you think the car might not be driven by a human?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't think so. I didn't seriously consider it. If you hadn't asked, I wouldn't have thought about it. Even though I knew the purpose of this trip, seeing the driver made me believe he was driving.

**Speaker 1:**
Reflecting on the ride, do you think there were any parts where the car might have been on autopilot?

**Speaker 2:**
Maybe on the straight roads. On straight roads, it could have been on autopilot. When turning or when other cars appeared, the driver might have intervened.

**Speaker 1:**
Why do you think it was on autopilot on the straight roads?

**Speaker 2:**
Because it's safer and doesn't require much intervention. For example, if a large truck is driving on the highway, the long straight stretches can be very tiring for a human driver. If there's reliable autopilot support, with controllable speed and direction, it can be very helpful.

**Speaker 2:**
On highways, you generally don't encounter many fluctuations or obstacles, so autopilot can be very useful. For instance, some companies we've interacted with operate in mining areas where there aren't many road conditions to worry about. As long as the vehicle can be controlled back and forth, it's sufficient.
**Speaker 1:**
When you are a pedestrian, walking on the road, and you need to cross an intersection without traffic lights, how do you judge the intentions of the oncoming vehicles?

**Speaker 2:**
Well, first I observe the traffic flow. If the traffic is light, I cross. If it's heavy, I try to yield to the vehicles because, after all, safety comes first. Regardless of whether there are traffic lights or not, the priority is to observe the situation. Sometimes there are special vehicles, right? You need to look ahead and assess the situation. Also, some people don't follow traffic rules, so you really need to be cautious and follow the "look twice before crossing" rule.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you slowly look for an opportunity to cross, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but I'm not always strictly adhering to the rules. Sometimes, if it's completely safe to cross, I will go ahead. If you don't cross when it's safe, it can be quite boring just standing there. I'm not someone who follows the rules to the letter, but I always ensure it's a controlled situation. Oh, it looks like we're about to wrap up.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, this is the last question. Let me check if there's anything else we haven't covered.

**Speaker 2:**
At least for this part.

**Speaker 1:**
There shouldn't be anything else.

**Speaker 2:**
Alright.

**Speaker 1:**
I'll go first.
