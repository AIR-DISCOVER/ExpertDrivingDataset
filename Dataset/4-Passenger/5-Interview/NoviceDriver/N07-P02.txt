**Speaker 1:**
Let's start with some basic questions. Do you often travel by car?

**Speaker 2:**
I usually ride an electric bike myself, but I take a car maybe once a week.

**Speaker 1:**
Three or four times a week? Is it by bus? Long-distance or short-distance trips?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, short-distance, around 20 minutes.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think about the vehicle we used for today's experiment?

**Speaker 2:**
In what aspects? Or...

**Speaker 1:**
Or how do you feel about the driver's skills? Pretty good? If you had a choice, what type of car do you prefer? Like an off-road vehicle, SUV, gasoline car, or electric car?

**Speaker 2:**
I prefer off-road vehicles; they are more spacious.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you drive yourself?

**Speaker 2:**
I can drive, but I don't do it often.

**Speaker 1:**
Not much, huh? Now let's review the video we just recorded. I'll ask some questions about the driver's actions. Feel free to point out anything you think was done particularly well or anything that made you uncomfortable.

**Speaker 2:**
Can you see the recording? Was the driver watching the recording?

**Speaker 1:**
Of course, he was watching.

**Speaker 2:**
I thought there was some kind of simulation light because he mentioned a black dot.

**Speaker 1:**
No, no, the driver was driving normally.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel during the ride, especially when merging into the auxiliary road?

**Speaker 2:**
The process was fine. The driver seemed very careful, looking left and right. It wasn't abrupt; it was quite smooth. It was okay.

**Speaker 1:**
Any specific feelings about merging into the auxiliary road?

**Speaker 2:**
No particular feelings. Nothing significantly different. No, it felt normal.

**Speaker 1:**
Was there anything that wasn't perfect? Today, there should have been a U-turn. How did you feel about that?

**Speaker 2:**
I remember that part. It seemed like the driver was either nervous or not very skilled at making the U-turn. It felt like he had to adjust multiple times and didn't make it in one go.

**Speaker 1:**
So, he didn't make the turn smoothly in one go?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. But maybe it wasn't possible to make it in one go. I'm not sure.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel concerned about the surrounding cars?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I was a bit worried about the surrounding cars when he had to stop and reverse.

**Speaker 1:**
Now, after the turn, there's the process of starting and accelerating. How did you feel about that?
**Speaker 1:**
Let's stop here and reverse a bit.

**Speaker 2:**
Okay.

**Speaker 1:**
Now, after turning, we are in the process of starting and accelerating. How do you feel about the acceleration process before we start? 

**Speaker 2:**
It's fine. It's not too abrupt, quite smooth.

**Speaker 1:**
Now we are in a steady driving phase. How do you feel about this phase?

**Speaker 2:**
The speed is appropriate, and everything feels fine. Nothing stands out particularly.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you feel about the turns?

**Speaker 2:**
I think it's okay. It doesn't feel very skilled, but it's acceptable.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you elaborate on what feels unskilled?

**Speaker 2:**
It seems like the driver is being very cautious, maybe overly so.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think it's a bit slow?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, somewhat.

**Speaker 1:**
How about the transitions in this area?

**Speaker 2:**
I don't have a strong impression. Nothing particularly stands out.

**Speaker 1:**
What about the left turn?

**Speaker 2:**
The left turn was done well.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, it was good.

**Speaker 2:**
I think the driver was very observant and careful. The turn was smooth without any abrupt movements.

**Speaker 1:**
How about the visibility and the overall feel?

**Speaker 2:**
There was nothing special. The visibility was clear, and the driver didn't slow down unnecessarily. It felt smooth and steady.

**Speaker 1:**
This is an intersection without traffic lights. How did you feel about passing through it?

**Speaker 2:**
Overall, I didn't feel much difference. The driver handled it smoothly, just like other intersections. There was no significant impression.

**Speaker 1:**
So, nothing stood out to you?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't even notice we turned so many times. Everything felt fine.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel anything unusual while in the car?

**Speaker 2:**
No, my focus was mostly on the sides. I didn't look forward much, and the turns felt natural.
**Speaker 1:** So, how was your experience with the turn?

**Speaker 2:** Actually, my attention was mostly on the side. He was in front, and I wasn't really looking ahead. When he turned, I just followed his line of sight and looked to the side. I didn't have a strong sense of the turn itself.

**Speaker 1:** Was there anything specific about the turn?

**Speaker 2:** From a technical and sensory perspective, it wasn't particularly smooth.

**Speaker 2:** I do remember feeling a bit tense because the traffic on that side seemed to be moving quite fast. I was a bit worried about the turn.

**Speaker 1:** The traffic on the left side?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, there was quite a bit of traffic on that side. He was turning from there.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel nervous?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, a bit. Especially when there are a lot of cars and people, and the driver is making a turn, I tend to feel a bit anxious.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think there's anything the driver could do to make you feel less nervous?

**Speaker 2:** Maybe just being more cautious, looking around more, and driving slower and more steadily. That would make me feel more at ease.

**Speaker 1:** It seems like the driver did manage to do that this time.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, he did a pretty good job.

**Speaker 2:** There was a moment that felt sudden because I didn't realize there was a car coming from the front, and then he turned abruptly. I wasn't sure what was happening at first.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, that was the road back to the parking lot.

**Speaker 2:** Right, so at that moment, I felt a bit confused and uncertain.

**Speaker 1:** Was it because you didn't know what was coming next?

**Speaker 2:** It felt like the car was already at the intersection, and then it suddenly turned. Usually, you would anticipate the turn earlier. It felt unexpected.

**Speaker 1:** It was quite sudden.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, and on the way back to the parking lot, I noticed a loud noise. Was it the engine?

**Speaker 1:** Was it a noise from the back seat? That was the car's noise, not related to the driver. Did you notice any dangerous maneuvers by the driver?

**Speaker 2:** No, other than what I mentioned earlier. I think he drove quite well and was considerate of pedestrians.
**Speaker 1:** You mentioned earlier that there were no issues. So, how do you think he could drive more safely?

**Speaker 2:** I think he drives quite well. He is considerate of pedestrians. For example, earlier on the road, there was a person who seemed unsure about crossing. He stopped and let the person go first. He is quite cautious and drives smoothly. I think he drives pretty well.

**Speaker 1:** Do you remember where exactly he yielded to the pedestrian?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't see it in the video, but I remember there was a person in front of us. He waved his hand to signal the pedestrian to go ahead.

**Speaker 1:** The driver waved, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it was on a side road. It felt like it was around that area, but it might not have been captured in the video.

**Speaker 1:** Was it when he was turning?

**Speaker 2:** No, it wasn't during a turn. There was a person around that spot, and he called out to them, and they crossed the road.

**Speaker 2:** But it wasn't in the video. You could ask another person who was there to check.

**Speaker 1:** When you usually ride in someone else's car, are there any behaviors from the driver that make you feel unsafe? Not just this time, but in general.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, things like swearing, driving with one hand while the other is resting on the window, or texting and using the phone while driving. Also, driving very fast and then stopping suddenly. These behaviors create significant safety risks. And then there are those who don't yield and seem to be in a constant competition with other drivers. These are the things that make me feel unsafe.

**Speaker 1:** Understood. Do you think the driver did anything this time that made you uncomfortable, aside from what you mentioned earlier?

**Speaker 2:** No, I don't think so.

**Speaker 1:** How do you think he could drive to make you feel safer and more comfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Sometimes when he turns, he does it a bit too quickly. It's not that he turns too fast, but he could be a bit smoother.

**Speaker 1:** So, he turns a bit quickly?

**Speaker 2:** No, it's not that he turns quickly. It's more that he could be smoother when there are no cars around. He doesn't need to slow down so much. It feels a bit rushed sometimes. But overall, he drives smoothly, better than my dad.

**Speaker 1:** When you ride in someone else's car...
**Speaker 1:**  
When you ride in someone else's car, what behaviors make you feel uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**  
It's different from feeling unsafe, right? It's more about feeling uncomfortable. For example, if someone drives very fast and then suddenly stops at a red light, it can make me feel carsick. Also, if they accelerate quickly or take turns too sharply, causing the car to sway from side to side, it can make me feel uneasy. Other than that, I'm generally okay.

**Speaker 1:**  
Next, let's talk about some questions related to autonomous driving. What do you think makes a driver a good or professional driver?

**Speaker 2:**  
First, I think a good driver should have stable emotions and not get easily upset by road conditions. Technical skills are also important. A good driver should be able to control their speed well. I can't stand erratic driving; it's very unsettling.

**Speaker 1:**  
What do you think is the biggest difference between an experienced driver and a novice driver?

**Speaker 2:**  
The biggest difference is that novice drivers are more cautious. For example, they are more careful when turning or driving on the road and tend to drive slower. Experienced drivers, on the other hand, might be more relaxed, sometimes driving with one hand and taking turns without slowing down much.

**Speaker 1:**  
In what ways do you think autonomous driving can never match human drivers?

**Speaker 2:**  
First, there's the aspect of conversation. Some drivers love to chat. Do you like chatting while driving?

**Speaker 1:**  
It depends on my mood. If I'm in a good mood, I don't mind chatting. Another thing is the intangible sense of security. Do you understand? When there's no one in the driver's seat, you might feel anxious about unexpected situations that the system might not handle well. But if there's a person there, you feel more relaxed and secure. This is especially true when riding alone at night; having a person there makes you feel more comfortable.

**Speaker 1:**  
Do you think the car we just talked about was driven by a person or was it on autonomous mode?

**Speaker 2:**  
It was driven by a person.
**Speaker 1:**
Do you think the car you were just in was being driven by a person or was it on autopilot?

**Speaker 2:**
It was being driven by a person.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright. If we assume that the car was actually on autopilot and the driver was just a safety officer, would your experience have felt different compared to knowing a human was driving?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I would think so.

**Speaker 1:**
Why is that?

**Speaker 2:**
Because if I knew a human was driving and then found out it was actually on autopilot, it would be surprising. 

**Speaker 1:**
Let's assume it was indeed an autonomous vehicle.

**Speaker 2:**
If I consider the way it was driven, I would say it didn't feel as skilled or as human-like. For example, I might think it could have taken a wider turn or adjusted speed more smoothly. It drove very steadily and took turns very slowly. If it was an autonomous vehicle, these are areas that could be improved. Overall, the experience was good, though.

**Speaker 1:**
Were there any specific details that made you think it might be on autopilot?

**Speaker 2:**
The driver was wearing something on their head, and there was some mention of a "black dot" at the beginning.

**Speaker 1:**
During the ride, did you notice anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
No, not really.

**Speaker 1:**
One last question: If you were a pedestrian crossing the street without traffic lights, how would you judge the intentions of non-electric vehicles or cars?

**Speaker 2:**
In such situations, I usually don't just step out. I might give a hand signal to indicate that I want to cross and see if the driver acknowledges it. If the driver doesn't start moving, then I would proceed.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you prefer to wait until there are no cars at all, or do you signal to cars to stop for you?

**Speaker 2:**
It depends on the situation. If I'm in a hurry, I might signal and cross quickly. If I'm not in a rush, I would wait until there are no cars.
Speaker 1: Sometimes when I'm in a hurry to get somewhere, I just bravely push through. I signal all the way and just go for it. But if I'm not in a rush, I wait until there are no cars before crossing.

Speaker 2: That makes sense. It's important to balance urgency with safety. 

Speaker 1: Yes, exactly. 

Speaker 2: Well, that wraps up our interview for today. It's exactly 5 o'clock.
