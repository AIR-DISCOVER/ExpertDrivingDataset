**Speaker 1:**
Ah, thank you for your time. Today, we took three trips, which wasn't easy. Let's start with some basic questions. Do you often travel by car?

**Speaker 2:**
About four times a month or less.

**Speaker 1:**
Four times a month, got it. Are these long trips or short trips?

**Speaker 2:**
Around 30 yuan per trip, I think.

**Speaker 1:**
A 30-yuan fare would be considered a short trip. How often do you take these trips?

**Speaker 2:**
Usually, each trip lasts about half an hour.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about today's ride?

**Speaker 2:**
I felt a bit uncomfortable in the back seat.

**Speaker 1:**
How would you rate the driver's skills? Were they average? If you had a choice, what type of car would you prefer? An SUV, a gasoline car, or an electric car? And why?

**Speaker 2:**
I think electric cars have more issues. I once took an electric car, and the driver had to stop to charge it, which took a long time.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you drive yourself?

**Speaker 2:**
Not often, almost never.

**Speaker 1:**
Let's review the video of our trip. I'll pause at certain points to ask about your feelings and any discomfort or safety concerns you had. Feel free to interrupt me if you have any comments. I noticed from the data that you pressed the handle before we started. Is that correct?

**Speaker 2:**
I don't think so. It might have been an accident.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright.

**Speaker 2:**
Oh, during that turn, I felt a bit uneasy. Every time we turned, especially at that spot, it felt uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
This spot here?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. There were several sharp turns.

**Speaker 1:**
This section, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it felt uncomfortable during the turns, and there was some bumpiness.

**Speaker 1:**
It was bumpy, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, and the turn was quite sharp.

**Speaker 1:**
A sharp turn and some bumps.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you press the handle when we made the right turn?

**Speaker 2:**
It might have been because of a sudden brake or acceleration, I guess.

**Speaker 1:**
During the right turn?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that could be the reason.
**Speaker 1:** So, you pressed the button, right?

**Speaker 2:** That might be because he braked suddenly or started abruptly, I guess.

**Speaker 1:** Was it during the right turn?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it could be because there was a pole at the entrance. He braked. If it was nearly 8 seconds, it might be because he braked. I felt he braked quite hard.

**Speaker 1:** He braked hard, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it was quite extreme, quite heavy.

**Speaker 1:** So, he braked heavily.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, you could feel it clearly. He stepped on the brake and stopped the car.

**Speaker 1:** He was about to turn right into the side road. How did you feel at that moment?

**Speaker 2:** If you...

**Speaker 1:** Here, it was fine. I noticed you pressed the button again when entering the main road.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, there was a car. You see, there was a car here.

**Speaker 1:** Oh, this car? How did you feel at that moment?

**Speaker 2:** I felt very tense. He suddenly swerved the steering wheel to the side to avoid the car.

**Speaker 1:** You felt tense, and the car came closer.

**Speaker 2:** I didn't notice at first. I was looking out the window, and suddenly I felt the car swerve. Then I saw a car passing by.

**Speaker 1:** Did the driver let that car pass?

**Speaker 2:** I think so. I wasn't looking, but I felt the driver turned the steering wheel to the right, swerving a bit. I definitely felt it.

**Speaker 1:** So, at that moment, he swerved to the right.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, and I looked and saw a car coming. I felt very tense, like we almost collided.

**Speaker 1:** He was quite close.

**Speaker 1:** You also pressed the button when he was making a U-turn.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, when he was making a U-turn.

**Speaker 1:** Was there a car, or...

**Speaker 2:** No, it was just during the U-turn.

**Speaker 1:** It wasn't very smooth? Let me check.

**Speaker 2:** I'm not sure what you mean by pressing the button. I just felt uncomfortable in unfamiliar places, like when braking or starting. During the U-turn, it was also uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:** The button was pressed at 38 minutes and 45 seconds, while waiting in line.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, he might have braked suddenly.

**Speaker 2:** He might have tapped the brake. I thought he was about to start, but he stopped there.

**Speaker 1:** You thought he was going to make the U-turn, but he stopped. Did you feel uncomfortable at that moment?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I felt uncomfortable because of the braking.
**Speaker 1:**
I thought he was going to make a U-turn. But then he stopped there. Did you feel uncomfortable at that moment?

**Speaker 2:**
I felt a bit uncomfortable because of the way he braked.

**Speaker 1:**
So, the car felt uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Not extremely uncomfortable. It's all relative.

**Speaker 1:**
I see. Did you press something at that moment?

**Speaker 2:**
Shopping? Yes, it was because of the U-turn.

**Speaker 1:**
How did the U-turn make you feel?

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel dizzy? Was it because he was too abrupt or something else?

**Speaker 2:**
I'm generally a sensitive person. For example, with U-turns, braking, and starting, I feel these actions very clearly. Even if I'm relaxed and just watching the road, I tend to amplify these sensations. So, I could feel it quite distinctly.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you felt a bit dizzy at that spot?

**Speaker 2:**
Not exactly dizzy, but somewhat uncomfortable. It's relative. It's different from watching a screen, right? Because you didn't specify the exact level of discomfort, so I just...

**Speaker 1:**
Maybe the audio and video weren't synchronized. I see you pressed something again here. Do you remember?

**Speaker 2:**
I don't really remember. Maybe it was because of the turn.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel uncomfortable during the turn?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, somewhat.

**Speaker 2:**
Did each number indicate a press? Did I press that many times?

**Speaker 1:**
Haha, I'm not sure. Sometimes pressing 9 might register multiple times. Do you remember pressing here?

**Speaker 2:**
Play it again. It might have been because of the braking. There was a car in front.

**Speaker 1:**
Was the braking too abrupt?

**Speaker 2:**
Not very abrupt. If you were driving, you might not notice these things as much. But as a passenger, you feel the braking and starting more distinctly. The driver might not be paying attention to the passenger's experience. For example, when you see a car and brake a bit harder, the passenger feels it more.

**Speaker 1:**
So, a small action by the driver can feel much bigger to the passenger?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. The impact on the passenger can be more significant.
**Speaker 1:** Even a small maneuver can significantly impact the passenger's experience.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it might seem minor to us, but for the passenger, it can be quite noticeable. Their attention is on the car, so they might not specifically notice the braking or quick acceleration, but they will feel it. For instance, if the driver doesn't gently press the accelerator and instead floors it, the passenger will feel a sudden jolt. It really depends on the driver's actions and how they affect the passenger.

**Speaker 1:** So, it's mainly the driver's actions that influence the passenger's experience. Did you notice any specific instances where this happened?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because I was sitting in the back, I couldn't see everything clearly. But I could definitely feel it when you made a turn. It felt like my head was being jolted.

**Speaker 1:** If I make a sudden maneuver, it can definitely cause that sensation. I noticed that most of your comments were related to turning.

**Speaker 2:** Exactly. When you turn, it can cause a feeling of dizziness or when you brake suddenly, it feels like your head is being pushed forward.

**Speaker 2:** For example, when we were driving through a narrow street with parked cars on the side, you were driving quite fast.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, there were parked cars on the side, but you were driving quickly.

**Speaker 2:** Right, there were cars parked on the right and traffic on the left, but you still drove fast. It made me a bit anxious, not just this time, but it reminded me of similar situations.

**Speaker 1:** What were you worried about? An accident?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. I'm generally a very cautious person. For instance, when I ride an electric scooter, I always slow down when I see cars. If there are cars on both sides, I wouldn't drive so fast.

**Speaker 1:** You mentioned this earlier.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, that's what I was referring to.

**Speaker 1:** You felt the speed was too high.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, especially on the third trip, it felt like the driver was in a hurry to get back. For example, if there were pedestrians or cars on the right side.

**Speaker 1:** I noticed you mentioned a car appearing from the right side.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it made me feel unsafe.

**Speaker 1:** Right, there was a car on the right. Was that when you pressed the button?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, that's correct.

**Speaker 1:** Do you remember if the car slowed down at that moment?

**Speaker 2:** I don't recall exactly, but I think it did slow down.
**Speaker 1:**
Did you notice anything?

**Speaker 2:**
Hmm, yes.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you remember anything specific about the car at that moment?

**Speaker 2:**
Maybe it slowed down, but I don't really remember. I didn't see it clearly.

**Speaker 1:**
Even if you didn't see it, you must have felt something.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes.

**Speaker 1:**
I noticed that when it passed by here, it didn't slow down. A car appeared from the left, and the driver turned the steering wheel to the left.

**Speaker 2:**
He probably had to turn the steering wheel. I'm not sure about the change.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you press the button when the car turned?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was probably because of the turn. The car was going quite fast. When you turn at high speed, you can feel it very clearly.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, the speed combined with the turn made it very noticeable. Did you feel uncomfortable or worried about safety?

**Speaker 2:**
I felt a brief dizziness.

**Speaker 1:**
A brief dizziness?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because I was in the car. Now that I look at it, I see someone on the right, but when I was in the car, sitting in the back, I couldn't see much. So, I didn't feel it until we reached that spot. I saw an electric bike on the left and a parked car on the right. At that moment, I felt it was quite late.

**Speaker 1:**
I see.

**Speaker 2:**
Which is?

**Speaker 1:**
Was the electric bike there at that time?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I was just checking if there was anything in front of you.

**Speaker 1:**
The team leader didn't mention it. I was just asking.

**Speaker 2:**
Maybe because the deceleration wasn't that quick, it felt okay. I waited a bit, so I didn't feel much.

**Speaker 1:**
How about here? Did you feel anything just now?

**Speaker 2:**
If there was no turn, then no, I didn't feel anything. You set up an observation point here, right?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes.

**Speaker 2:**
Is there anything different here besides the turn?

**Speaker 1:**
No, we just ask about every turn and U-turn on this route.

**Speaker 1:**
You pressed the button here as well.

**Speaker 2:**
That was probably because of the turn.

**Speaker 1:**
Right.

**Speaker 2:**
It was likely due to acceleration, deceleration, or turning.

**Speaker 1:**
You also pressed the button when turning right. Was it because of the sound?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was probably because of the sound.

**Speaker 1:**
The data from the button presses should cover most of it. Did you feel anything specific when turning right?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't feel anything.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about the acceleration after the turn?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't press the button then, did I?

**Speaker 1:**
No, you didn't.
**Speaker 1:** In this situation, how did you feel about the acceleration process?

**Speaker 2:** Yesterday, where was it? I didn't press it, right?

**Speaker 1:** No, you didn't press it. From now on, you didn't press it.

**Speaker 2:** Right, not pressing it means it was probably fine.

**Speaker 1:** Okay, and during the straight driving process just now, you also felt it was okay, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it was about to turn, then immediately started driving, right?

**Speaker 2:** It's best to turn left into the professional content.

**Speaker 1:** Professional, what direction? Our entire lab is called the Institute of Intelligent Industry. We study videos related to autonomous driving. Let's stop here. Now, let's ask some other questions. Haha, besides the handle products, did you notice any dangerous operations by the driver?

**Speaker 2:** As I mentioned earlier, the first was when the car came out, and the second was on the road. I felt there was a car parked on the right and another passing on the left, and he was still driving very fast. Just these two.

**Speaker 1:** How do you think it could be driven more safely?

**Speaker 2:** How? You see, just like that. Observe the road conditions more. When you usually ride in someone else's car, are there any operations by the driver that make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, for example, when there are many cars, he starts very quickly, accelerates very fast. Also, when there are cars passing on both sides or when there are people around, driving fast can feel very critical.

**Speaker 1:** Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** Not for now.

**Speaker 1:** Besides the handle scenario, did any other operations make you feel uncomfortable during data collection?

**Speaker 2:** Starting too fast. Did you use it? But this also falls under manual operation.

**Speaker 1:** Nothing else. When you ride in someone else's car, what kind of operations make you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Are you referring to that?

**Speaker 1:** Is it the same, or is it the data collector?

**Speaker 2:** No. You know, when you ride in a car, does smoking count?

**Speaker 1:** Smoking? Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** There's also road rage. When others cut in, you curse at them. Anything else?

**Speaker 1:** No, that's it. What do you think makes a good or professional driver? Specifically.

**Speaker 2:** Smooth driving. Specifically, braking and starting. Pay a little more attention, brake gently, and accelerate slowly. Don't press the gas pedal all the way down at once. Anything else? Also, maintaining a stable attitude.

**Speaker 1:** Okay, what do you think are the differences between new drivers and experienced drivers?
**Speaker 1:** When accelerating, don't press the pedal all the way down at once. Is there anything else?

**Speaker 2:** Another important aspect is maintaining composure and stability.

**Speaker 1:** Got it. What do you think is the biggest difference between new drivers and experienced drivers?

**Speaker 2:** The biggest difference? I think new drivers tend to be more cautious.

**Speaker 1:** More cautious, right.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, and experienced drivers might be less emotionally stable.

**Speaker 1:** Less emotionally stable, indeed.

**Speaker 2:** For example, if someone cuts them off, they might get very angry. As a new driver, you tend to focus on your own mistakes, but as an experienced driver, you might start to think that everyone else is at fault.

**Speaker 1:** I see. Now, regarding autonomous driving, do you think there are aspects where autonomous driving can never match human drivers?

**Speaker 2:** The sense of security, perhaps?

**Speaker 1:** The sense of security? Do you feel that human driving inherently feels safer than autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:** Personally, I still don't feel very comfortable with autonomous driving.

**Speaker 1:** You don't feel comfortable with autonomous driving, right.

**Speaker 2:** Or at least not driving autonomously alone. If someone is with me, I might feel a bit safer. But overall, I still think human driving feels safer.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think the car we were just in was driven by a human or was it on autonomous mode?

**Speaker 2:** It was driven by a human.

**Speaker 1:** Why do you think so?

**Speaker 2:** It was quite obvious. I feel that autonomous driving would be smoother, especially with acceleration and deceleration. Since it's programmed, it should be more stable. The ride we just had was not very smooth or comfortable.

**Speaker 1:** If the car we were just in was actually on autonomous mode, but the driver was just sitting there, would your experience have been different? Assuming the driving style was exactly the same, but it was autonomous, how would you feel?

**Speaker 2:** What do you mean by different?

**Speaker 1:** I mean in terms of your feelings and experience.

**Speaker 2:** I don't think it would be different.

**Speaker 1:** So, it wouldn't feel different, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, but if there was a person sitting there, I would feel safer.

**Speaker 1:** Having someone sitting there makes you feel safer, right. During the ride, was there any moment or detail that made you question whether the car was on autonomous mode?

**Speaker 2:** No, except when you mentioned it.

**Speaker 1:** Okay, one last question. If you had high expectations for autonomous driving, do you think it should perform better than what we experienced?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I have high expectations for autonomous driving. I believe it should be more stable because it's machine-controlled. The ride we had didn't meet those expectations.
**Speaker 1:**  
I don't think it should be driven like this. I feel that because of the machine settings, it should be more stable. Since this person has driven several times, I feel that his driving skills might not be good. Maybe his starting or something else is off. By the third trip, I felt he was in a hurry to get home, so he drove very fast. This made me think that I might have higher expectations for autonomous driving.

**Speaker 2:**  
You have high expectations, right?

**Speaker 1:**  
Yes, I do.

**Speaker 2:**  
So, you think it shouldn't be like this. Do you mean that there was some autonomous driving involved?

**Speaker 1:**  
No, I'm just asking hypothetically. Lastly, if you were a pedestrian crossing a street without traffic lights, how would you judge the car's or driver's intentions?

**Speaker 2:**  
I would look around more.

**Speaker 1:**  
Where would you look more?

**Speaker 2:**  
I would observe the surroundings, the entire street.

**Speaker 1:**  
How would you judge if a car is approaching? How would you determine if it will stop or keep going?

**Speaker 2:**  
I would look at the distance between the car and myself and see if the car is slowing down. If I feel the car is slowing down, I would quickly cross. If not, I would wait for it to pass.

**Speaker 1:**  
Do you usually prefer to cross quickly or wait longer?

**Speaker 2:**  
I usually prefer to cross quickly.

**Speaker 1:**  
Alright, we've asked all the questions we had. Lastly, how would you evaluate the driver's performance today overall?

**Speaker 2:**  
I felt the driving wasn't very smooth.

**Speaker 1:**  
Not very smooth. Did you feel safe?

**Speaker 2:**  
I wouldn't say I felt very safe. I wouldn't want to take a second ride. It wasn't extremely unsafe, but I wasn't comfortable enough to want to do it again.

**Speaker 1:**  
How about the comfort level?

**Speaker 2:**  
Are we rating out of 10?

**Speaker 1:**  
It doesn't matter, just say what you think.

**Speaker 2:**  
Let's rate it out of 10.

**Speaker 1:**  
Sure, out of 10, how would you rate the comfort?

**Speaker 2:**  
I would give it a 7 out of 10. Is this water for us to drink?

**Speaker 1:**  
Yes, it is. Thank you for your participation. Is there anything else?

**Speaker 2:**  
Just to confirm, is autonomous driving supposed to be very smooth?

**Speaker 1:**  
I don't know, I haven't experienced it myself.

**Speaker 2:**  
Oh, okay.
