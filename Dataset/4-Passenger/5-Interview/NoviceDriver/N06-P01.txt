**Speaker 1:**
I'd like to start by asking you a few questions about your usual travel habits. Do you often take a car to get around?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, when we go out to eat or visit a place, we usually take a taxi or use a ride-hailing service like Didi.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you only take a car when you have something specific to do, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's correct. Usually on weekends.

**Speaker 1:**
On weekends. And are these trips generally long or short?

**Speaker 2:**
Typically, they are between 5 to 10 kilometers.

**Speaker 1:**
How long does a 5 to 10 kilometer trip usually take?

**Speaker 2:**
About half an hour.

**Speaker 1:**
Half an hour. How did you find the experience of riding in our vehicle for this experiment?

**Speaker 2:**
It felt similar to my usual car rides.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it felt pretty much the same as usual?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, nothing particularly different for me.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you find the driver's skills?

**Speaker 2:**
They were good, as expected.

**Speaker 1:**
If you had to choose, what type of car would you prefer for your travels?

**Speaker 2:**
What types are you referring to?

**Speaker 1:**
Like SUVs, sedans, electric cars, gasoline carsâ€”different models and energy sources.

**Speaker 2:**
I think I would prefer an electric car.

**Speaker 1:**
Why do you prefer electric cars?

**Speaker 2:**
They feel easier to handle. It seems like they respond better to your inputs and accelerate faster.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you find electric cars easier to drive?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, definitely easier to drive. And when I'm a passenger, I also prefer them.

**Speaker 1:**
You prefer electric cars as a passenger too, but the experience might be different from driving.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I like the smooth and quiet ride they offer.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you have any preference for a specific car model?

**Speaker 2:**
Just a regular sedan is fine for me.

**Speaker 1:**
A regular sedan is okay. Do you drive yourself?

**Speaker 2:**
I don't drive in Beijing, but I do drive at home, especially during the summer holidays.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you rate your driving skills?

**Speaker 2:**
I think I'm an average driver.

**Speaker 1:**
Why do you consider yourself an average driver?

**Speaker 2:**
One reason is dealing with complex and unfamiliar road conditions. Another is that I might feel anxious about unexpected situations on the road.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you're concerned about sudden incidents?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
Now, I can play a video of our recent drive. While watching, if you notice any moments where your experience changes, feel free to point them out. I'll also pause at certain points to ask for your feedback.

**Speaker 2:**
Sure, go ahead.
**Speaker 1:**
If at any moment you feel a change in your experience, please let me know. I will also pause at certain points to ask about your feelings.

**Speaker 2:**
Okay, you mean situations where I feel a change in the experience. Got it.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, for example, if you think the driver is going too fast or doing a great job, you can mention it. If you feel the driver is being courteous to pedestrians, you can also bring that up. So, let's start. How did you feel when the driver started the car?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't feel anything unusual. I think it was fine, no issues.

**Speaker 1:**
Oh, you mean...

**Speaker 2:**
Are we done with that part?

**Speaker 1:**
It seems like there was no sound here. Let me restart and check again. This part wasn't muted.

**Speaker 1:**
So, we can only...

**Speaker 1:**
Let's proceed. Do you think the driver should have honked to alert the nearby vehicle when starting?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, yes, but it didn't cause any issues.

**Speaker 1:**
It felt like the driver was turning quite fast. Did you feel anything special at that moment?

**Speaker 2:**
No, not really.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel the turn was too sharp?

**Speaker 2:**
I think it was okay.

**Speaker 1:**
You think it was okay? So, the speed and smoothness were fine?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I think it was fine. Do you think the editing is good?

**Speaker 1:**
From the video, it seems fine to me, but it's based on your experience. How do you think the driver handled the turn? Did he pay attention to the road conditions?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, there was a car that almost sideswiped us when we entered the main road.

**Speaker 1:**
You mean when exiting the parking lot?

**Speaker 2:**
No, no, not there. It was further ahead.

**Speaker 1:**
Here?

**Speaker 2:**
No, that's not it. It's further ahead in the video. You can keep playing it.

**Speaker 1:**
Let me know when we get to that part. Did you have any safety concerns during the turn?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't have any concerns.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel uncomfortable at any point?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't feel uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you have any concerns about the driver's actions?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't have any concerns because the other car was supposed to yield to us.

**Speaker 2:**
In 150 meters, turn left.

**Speaker 1:**
Were you worried about hitting the electric bike in front?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I wasn't worried.

**Speaker 2:**
Prepare to turn left.

**Speaker 1:**
Overall, how did you feel about this stretch of the road?
**Speaker 1:** Did you think you were going to hit the electric bike in front?

**Speaker 2:** No, no, I didn't.

**Speaker 2:** We're about to turn left ahead.

**Speaker 1:** How do you feel about driving on this stretch of road overall?

**Speaker 2:** The road is okay. Up to this point, there haven't been any issues. But here, you need to be a bit more careful.

**Speaker 1:** You mean when merging onto the main road?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. When you get to this point.

**Speaker 1:** So, the side road is functioning normally.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, and then you enter the main road here.

**Speaker 1:** Right, here? Yes, at around 20 km/h. Did you feel any discomfort or lack of safety at that moment? Because there was another car in front.

**Speaker 2:** At that moment, I did feel a bit of a sudden jolt when I turned the steering wheel sharply. I forgot to press the button; I thought it was a special situation. But I think this kind of situation is quite common. I was just preparing to move the car quickly.

**Speaker 1:** I noticed you didn't press the handle. Even though it's common, did you feel uncomfortable in the car at that time?

**Speaker 2:** No, I didn't feel uncomfortable. The sudden braking was just a sensation.

**Speaker 1:** So, sudden braking doesn't usually make you feel uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** No, it doesn't. Why would it?

**Speaker 1:** Because it can be quite sudden.

**Speaker 2:** Maybe, but I think it just felt like a slight bump or a sudden stop. I might get a bit scared if it felt like a collision.

**Speaker 1:** You need to feel that impact, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I might be a bit more aggressive in my driving.

**Speaker 1:** I understand what you mean.

**Speaker 2:** We're about to reach the classic route, then make a U-turn in 10 meters to enter the main road.

**Speaker 1:** How do you feel about this stretch of road? We just passed over a lot of manhole covers. Did you feel any constant bumpiness?

**Speaker 2:** No, I don't really remember that.

**Speaker 1:** You don't remember?

**Speaker 1:** But in our interviews, we usually ask about these detailed points.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I might have just ignored it.

**Speaker 1:** Ignoring it can also be a reaction.

**Speaker 2:** We'll make a U-turn in 10 meters to enter the main road. It didn't affect me much, so I ignored it.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think the cars were too close together at that point? Do you remember?

**Speaker 2:** Normally, as long as you can't see the front car's bumper, it's fine.

**Speaker 1:** So, you think it was normal here?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it seemed just right.

**Speaker 1:** So, the road seemed quite smooth.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it was smooth. We just passed a few bumps. Let's see. We're about to reach the classic route, then make a U-turn in 10 meters to enter the main road.

**Speaker 1:** How do you think the driver did with the U-turn?

**Speaker 2:** The U-turn was done well. It was really good. It was done in one go.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, because usually...
**Speaker 1:**
How do you think the driver did with the U-turn here?

**Speaker 2:**
Hmm, the U-turn was pretty good. Really good, actually. He did it in one go.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, because usually, many drivers struggle with this spot.

**Speaker 2:**
In 200-350 meters, we will reach the waypoint. I tried it myself beforehand.

**Speaker 1:**
He definitely did a test drive, and this video is probably his third time driving here. He must have driven this route four times. During our first two test drives, were there any moments that stood out to you? If you can't remember now, we can look back.

**Speaker 2:**
We are about to reach the waypoint. Turn right in 40 meters.

**Speaker 1:**
It feels like the driver accelerated quite suddenly here.

**Speaker 2:**
I actually like it when there's no hesitation, especially when there are no cars around.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you prefer a faster driving style?

**Speaker 2:**
Turn right in 40 meters.

**Speaker 1:**
It feels more comfortable, right? And there wasn't much traffic at this intersection.

**Speaker 2:**
In 250 meters, we will reach the waypoint. Turn right in 20 meters.

**Speaker 1:**
Earlier, the car in front suddenly slowed down. Did you feel our driver braked too abruptly?

**Speaker 2:**
Probably, yes.

**Speaker 1:**
But it was still within a normal range for you?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but I only notice it when it's really abnormal.

**Speaker 1:**
I understand. You mentioned that you only feel discomfort if it feels like a collision is imminent, so your tolerance is higher than average. That's why I asked. Everyone has different thresholds. Turn right in 10 meters. How did you feel about this turn?

**Speaker 2:**
We have reached the waypoint.

**Speaker 1:**
Everything felt normal, but I still need to ask.

**Speaker 2:**
We are about to reach the waypoint. Turn left in 30 meters.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel worried when that car suddenly appeared?

**Speaker 2:**
A little bit. It seemed like the driver didn't notice the black car ahead.

**Speaker 1:**
Oh, so you felt the driver wasn't paying attention?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it seemed like he didn't notice it. Now our driver is coming out.

**Speaker 1:**
Did our driver slow down?

**Speaker 2:**
He definitely did. Turn left in 30 meters. Let me check the video again. It seems like he didn't.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, at that moment, there was some concern. Do you think our driver should have slowed down more?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, he should have been more cautious. He should have observed the traffic better.

**Speaker 1:**
The road conditions...
**Speaker 1:** You should slow down a bit, right?

**Speaker 2:** Actually, he should have yielded to me. Since we were coming from the same place, he should have observed the traffic.

**Speaker 1:** So, you think the driver did nothing wrong?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I think it was fine, but maybe he could have slowed down a bit earlier. When approaching the destination, turn left in 30 meters, then turn left at the end of the road.

**Speaker 1:** That left turn felt normal to you?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, 100 meters to the destination.

**Speaker 1:** Were you worried about hitting any pedestrians on this stretch of road?

**Speaker 2:** No, because the distance between the cars was quite large.

**Speaker 1:** Was the speed of the car a concern?

**Speaker 2:** The speed wasn't particularly fast, and there were no pedestrians in the middle of the road. Approaching the destination, turn left in 10 meters.

**Speaker 1:** Did the turn feel normal?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, 400 meters to the destination. Did you feel any bumps on this road?

**Speaker 1:** No.

**Speaker 2:** Approaching the destination, turn right in 30 meters.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think he was driving too fast here?

**Speaker 2:** Approaching the destination, turn right in 30 meters.

**Speaker 1:** Did you observe if the driver was speeding, especially since there was a speed limit sign?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't observe.

**Speaker 1:** Turn right, then turn right in 200 meters. Turn right at the traffic light in 200 meters, then approach the destination.

**Speaker 2:** Did you feel too close to the side?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, because there was an electric bike next to us, and the solid line in front might have caused the driver to change lanes.

**Speaker 2:** Were you worried about safety at that moment?

**Speaker 1:** I was focused on the road and didn't notice the person. The driver should have changed lanes earlier.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, he should have changed lanes earlier and slowed down a bit.

**Speaker 1:** Now, looking back, do you think the driver should have changed lanes earlier?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, he should have changed lanes earlier. It seemed like he wanted to overtake but couldn't.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel the driver was too close to the solid line?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I was worried about safety, especially with the electric bike so close. I was also concerned about getting points deducted because I saw a camera.

**Speaker 1:** So, you think the driver didn't follow traffic rules?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I didn't notice the person at that moment because I was focused on the turn and the solid line. Turn right, then approach the destination.

**Speaker 1:** Did the right turn feel normal to you?
**Speaker 1:** When you saw the line being crossed, you might not have been paying much attention. Okay, turn right, and then we'll reach the classic route nearby.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, the right turn is about 350 meters ahead to reach the classic route.

**Speaker 1:** Hmm, so on this wide road...

**Speaker 2:** We're about to arrive.

**Speaker 1:** Do you find the experience better here compared to other places?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, definitely.

**Speaker 1:** Does it feel more comfortable?

**Speaker 2:** It feels less stressful. Driving on this kind of road is better than in areas with lots of pedestrians, motorcycles, and electric bikes.

**Speaker 1:** More relaxing.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, we're about to reach the driving experience point, in about 10 meters.

**Speaker 1:** The right turn here is also normal. It feels like the driver made a wide turn.

**Speaker 2:** I didn't notice that.

**Speaker 1:** Were you a bit nervous?

**Speaker 2:** I think the driver might not have noticed it either.

**Speaker 1:** Were you worried that he might miss the turn?

**Speaker 2:** Sometimes I feel that way too. You can't always drive perfectly, right? There might be some sharp turns.

**Speaker 1:** Exactly.

**Speaker 2:** We almost missed the turn.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, as a passenger, were you worried he might miss it?

**Speaker 2:** If he missed it, I wouldn't worry too much. We'd just have to go around again. But he didn't miss it, just almost did.

**Speaker 1:** Right, he didn't miss it, but it was close.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it was close. In 150 meters, we'll reach the classic route.

**Speaker 2:** In 30 meters, turn right. In 350 meters, we'll reach the classic route.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel any unusual bumps on the road?

**Speaker 2:** We're about to reach the point, in 40 meters, turn left.

**Speaker 2:** We're near the point, in 40 meters.

**Speaker 1:** Is there anything special about turning left here? No, it feels normal.

**Speaker 2:** In 100 meters, we'll reach the classic route. The red light is about to turn green.

**Speaker 1:** When the car stopped here, how did you feel? It felt normal.

**Speaker 2:** In 1 kilometer, we'll reach the classic route.

**Speaker 1:** I can't remember exactly how I felt a few days ago.

**Speaker 2:** Near the classic route, in 100 meters, turn right. Then, in 100 meters...

**Speaker 1:** Turn right at the road entrance.

**Speaker 2:** Turn right at the end of the road to enter the main road.

**Speaker 1:** Over here...

**Speaker 2:** Yes, that's right. I remember seeing an old man.

**Speaker 1:** Seeing him, and...

**Speaker 2:** Hoping not to hit him.

**Speaker 1:** Were you worried about hitting him?

**Speaker 2:** At that moment...

**Speaker 1:** I felt the driver wasn't slowing down. If you were the driver, would you slow down?

**Speaker 2:** I would slow down.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel close to the old man?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it felt quite close.
**Speaker 1:** If you were the driver, would you slow down here?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I would slow down.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel that the car was too close to the curb?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it was quite close. How did you manage to get so close?

**Speaker 1:** I was a bit worried at that moment, right? But when turning, it felt normal.

**Speaker 2:** In 400 meters, make a U-turn at the traffic light.

**Speaker 1:** I need to make a U-turn at the green light. It seems like the red light has been on for a long time.

**Speaker 2:** Enter the main road, then turn right in 200 meters.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel that the car was too close to the one in front?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it was a bit close.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel like it was almost going to hit the car in front?

**Speaker 2:** I couldn't see the wheels of the car in front. It was that close.

**Speaker 1:** Do you feel it's a bit unsafe?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, now that you mention it, it does feel a bit close. But I wasn't worried about a collision.

**Speaker 1:** Was the U-turn too sharp?

**Speaker 2:** No, it wasn't too sharp.

**Speaker 1:** In 200 meters, turn right, then immediately keep left.

**Speaker 1:** Does driving on these small roads make you more nervous than usual?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, there are often unexpected pedestrians.

**Speaker 1:** Were you worried about pedestrians suddenly appearing?

**Speaker 2:** A little bit. Since I wasn't the driver, I didn't think about it much. But I trusted the driver.

**Speaker 1:** Did you trust today's driver?

**Speaker 2:** Why wouldn't I trust them? Of course, I trusted them. Turn right, then immediately keep left.

**Speaker 1:** Wow, this place looks quite narrow from the camera. Did you feel that way at the time?

**Speaker 2:** Maybe I'm not that sensitive to these things.

**Speaker 1:** In 80 meters, turn left, then in 60 meters, turn right.

**Speaker 1:** Even though you didn't press the brake, do you remember any actions by the driver that made you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:** The destination is approaching.

**Speaker 1:** When merging onto the main road, the driver turned the steering wheel too sharply. What situations make you feel unsafe when you're a passenger in someone else's car?

**Speaker 2:** When driving on small roads with many pedestrians and electric bikes, I worry more about others than myself. I worry the driver might hit someone. So, if the car is going too fast on these small roads, I feel unsafe.
**Speaker 1:**
Are you worried about others? Are you concerned that the driver might hit someone else? So, if you're driving too fast on these small roads, do you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, as a passenger, when I'm in someone else's car, I don't worry much about myself.

**Speaker 1:**
But safety can actually be a two-way street.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but I might be more afraid of the car hitting someone else.

**Speaker 1:**
So, if the car is going too fast, you're afraid it might hit someone, right? Are there any other behaviors that make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**
In today's scenario, it didn't really happen, but when I'm on a bus, especially when the bus starts moving from a stop, that's a situation where I might feel unsafe.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it's like when we're moving forward and the bus starts to drive away from the stop?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
Can we focus on the driver's actions? You mentioned two scenarios.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the two scenarios I described: one is on a small road. Am I speaking from the driver's perspective or as a passenger?

**Speaker 1:**
As a passenger?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, as a passenger, I don't feel unsafe for myself.

**Speaker 1:**
Would sudden stops count as well?

**Speaker 2:**
Sudden stops, yes, like when there's a blind spot and suddenly an electric bike or a person appears out of nowhere.

**Speaker 1:**
Like when someone suddenly pops out?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's concerning.

**Speaker 1:**
Some people worry about the driver swerving or driving too fast, which raises safety concerns. You don't have these worries?

**Speaker 2:**
No, because even if there's a collision, it usually doesn't have a significant impact on the people inside the car. 

**Speaker 1:**
During this recent trip, did the driver do anything that made you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
The only thing was the way the driver handled the steering wheel.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else besides that?

**Speaker 2:**
No, just whether the driving experience was comfortable or not.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you think driving can be made safer?

**Speaker 2:**
By driving slower.

**Speaker 1:**
Driving slower, just like that. But you mentioned earlier that you feel comfortable when driving faster, so how do you reconcile that?

**Speaker 2:**
Driving faster is fine as long as it's within a safe range. I prefer it when there are more cars and fewer pedestrians, like on main roads where everyone is driving. Generally, there are fewer issues in those situations. It's the small roads that are more concerning.
**Speaker 1:**
When there are many cars, not people, on the main roads, everyone is driving on them, and usually, there aren't many issues. But on smaller roads or side roads, unless you feel it's safe, you generally need to drive slower, especially if you're not familiar with the road conditions.

**Speaker 2:**
So, how can driving be more comfortable for you? Is it by driving faster within a safe range?

**Speaker 1:**
I might not have explained it clearly before. I like the moment of acceleration, that burst of speed.

**Speaker 2:**
You mean that?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, the feeling of being pushed back during the initial acceleration. But for long-term driving, it should be more stable. Whether driving fast or slow, it should be smooth.

**Speaker 2:**
By smooth, you mean?

**Speaker 1:**
Maintaining a consistent speed, yes, the speed should be steady.

**Speaker 2:**
What behaviors from other drivers make you uncomfortable when you're a passenger? Sudden stops?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, sudden stops and abrupt steering.

**Speaker 2:**
That's about it. Can you give me some examples of other actions that might make you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 1:**
Actually, I have a question. You mentioned that abrupt steering makes you uncomfortable, but when I just got on the main road, the driver made a sudden turn, and you said it didn't bother you. So, is it the intensity of the steering?

**Speaker 2:**
It might be when the car stops suddenly after a sharp turn or abrupt braking, making me lurch forward. If the car is moving fast, sudden steering doesn't usually bother me. For example, if I'm driving and a car comes close to me from the side or behind, I might make a quick turn to avoid it. This kind of sudden steering is common in daily driving. But if a person suddenly appears in front of me, forcing me to make a sharp turn or brake suddenly, making me lurch forward, that scares me and makes me uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
Okay, so what qualities do you think make a good or professional driver?

**Speaker 2:**
First, from a pedestrian's perspective, if I'm standing on the road...

**Speaker 1:**
You can also consider it from a passenger's perspective.

**Speaker 2:**
From a passenger's perspective, I think politeness is important. A good driver should be courteous to pedestrians and give way to buses.
**Speaker 1:** From a passenger's perspective, I think it's important to be polite. This means yielding to pedestrians, buses, and taxis. Additionally, having comprehensive driving skills is crucial.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, driving skills include good anticipation and quick reflexes. It's about being able to predict and react swiftly to different situations.

**Speaker 1:** I understand.

**Speaker 2:** And then, of course, there are specific driving techniques, like being good at reversing and making smooth turns.

**Speaker 1:** Do you consider yourself an experienced driver or a novice?

**Speaker 2:** A driver? I would say I'm just about able to drive on the road.

**Speaker 1:** Haha, so that makes you a novice driver.

**Speaker 2:** If those are the only two options, then yes.

**Speaker 1:** What do you think is the biggest difference between you and an experienced driver?

**Speaker 2:** It's probably the quick and accurate feedback. Experienced drivers can assess road conditions and make the right decisions quickly. Another important aspect is the psychological side of driving. Experienced drivers tend to be more confident and composed.

**Speaker 1:** More confident?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, more confident.

**Speaker 1:** So, do you feel less confident as a driver?

**Speaker 2:** If I were the driver, I might not feel as confident.

**Speaker 1:** Have you ever learned about autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I've learned about it and experienced it.

**Speaker 1:** You haven't experienced it?

**Speaker 2:** Let me clarify, I understand the concept, but I haven't experienced it firsthand. What exactly do you mean by autonomous driving?

**Speaker 1:** I mean both autonomous and assisted driving.

**Speaker 2:** Okay, I understand. From a consumer's perspective, I've researched it. My field of study is somewhat related to image recognition, though not specifically for automotive applications.

**Speaker 1:** Based on your understanding of autonomous vehicles, what are some things that autonomous cars can never do as well as human drivers?

**Speaker 2:** My first thought is the difference between day and night driving. If the system relies on cameras for recognition, it won't be as effective as the human eye. Hardware limitations affect its performance.

**Speaker 1:** You mean recognizing road conditions during the day and night?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. Cameras might work better during the day, but at night, their performance can be limited due to hardware constraints.

**Speaker 1:** I see.

**Speaker 2:** Additionally, in unexpected situations, like a pedestrian suddenly appearing, I think human drivers can react and handle it better than current autonomous systems.
**Speaker 1:**  
So, just those two points?

**Speaker 2:**  
I might not be very familiar with other aspects, like certain special scenarios, for example, driving in the rain or during a sandstorm.

**Speaker 1:**  
Weather conditions, you mean?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, I'm not sure how to handle those. In heavy fog, for instance, human visibility might be around 5 meters. I don't know how well it can recognize traffic lights or assess the car's condition. It might still rely on navigation software combined with human judgment.

**Speaker 1:**  
Do you think the gentleman earlier was driving the car himself or was it in autonomous mode?

**Speaker 2:**  
He was driving himself.

**Speaker 1:**  
Why do you think so?

**Speaker 2:**  
How could autonomous driving manage to drive like that?

**Speaker 1:**  
Hahaha, you mean the part where it turned right? You think autonomous driving wouldn't handle that well? The person almost missed it. Have you considered that it might have been specially designed?

**Speaker 2:**  
No, even if it was specially designed, it couldn't have knocked out the first camera.

**Speaker 1:**  
Right, so if that was an autonomous driving system with a safety driver pretending to drive, could you identify any details that suggest it was autonomous?

**Speaker 2:**  
I've never experienced a fully autonomous car. I've seen Teslas abroad that can drive completely hands-free. When I filled out the questionnaire a few days ago, I thought I was coming to experience that.

**Speaker 1:**  
So, it was different from your expectations?

**Speaker 2:**  
I didn't have any particularly high expectations. I thought it would be fine either way. Let me think about the details. Do you mean sometimes it's autonomous and sometimes it's human-driven?

**Speaker 1:**  
If you think that way, can you identify any details that make you feel it wasn't a human driving, or is it hard to recall?

**Speaker 2:**  
I think the turning and reversing.

**Speaker 1:**  
Turning and reversing?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, turning and reversing, and also turning at intersections.

**Speaker 1:**  
Why do you think it might have been autonomous?

**Speaker 2:**  
But not all the time.

**Speaker 1:**  
Certain specific features?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, the turning was quite slow, which I liked. It wasn't abrupt before the turn. The speed was very consistent.

**Speaker 1:**  
Slow and steady?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, very steady. This kind of turn feels like something autonomous driving could achieve.

**Speaker 2:**  
And the acceleration felt like a human was driving. The way it started and accelerated felt like how I usually drive.
**Speaker 1:** Accelerating, I feel like the way it drives is similar to how a human would. The acceleration at the start feels quite natural. From what you just experienced, do you think it matches how you usually drive?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, when there's no one in front of me, I feel confident.

**Speaker 1:** So, you think the driving style of the driver is similar to your own, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. And when it comes to changing lanes, I felt it was definitely human-like. I had a good feeling about it.

**Speaker 1:** Why do you think it felt like a human was driving, especially during the lane change?

**Speaker 2:** Well, the way it maneuvered and the way it handled the situation felt very natural. The first and second times were consistent.

**Speaker 1:** As a pedestrian, for example, when you need to cross an intersection without traffic lights, how do you judge the intentions of oncoming vehicles? How do you decide whether to cross or not?

**Speaker 2:** I look at the distance. If the car is too close, I don't cross. If it's farther away, I cross quickly.

**Speaker 1:** In such situations, how do you generally cross? Do you wait for an opportunity, like if a car lets you go, you stop in the middle of the road and wait for the next car, or do you just go straight across?

**Speaker 2:** It depends on the situation. For example, at a congested intersection, if I'm crossing with a green light and there's a car turning, if there are many cars, they usually stop for pedestrians. If there are only one or two cars, I judge based on their distance. At straight road crossings without traffic lights, I look at the car's distance. If there are only one or two cars and they are far away, I cross quickly. If they are close, I wait.

**Speaker 1:** So, you specifically look at the distance and the number of vehicles, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, and after crossing the zebra crossing, I also consider the car's speed. If there are many cars at an intersection, one might yield.

**Speaker 1:** Let me check if there are any more questions. No, that's all for today's interview. Thank you very much for participating in our experiment today.
