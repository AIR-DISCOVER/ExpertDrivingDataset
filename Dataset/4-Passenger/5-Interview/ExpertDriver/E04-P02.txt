**Speaker 1:**
Let me start by asking you a question about your daily life. Do you often travel by car?

**Speaker 2:**
Not often. When I do, it's usually for longer trips rather than short ones.

**Speaker 1:**
So, when you do take a car, is it usually for long distances? How long are these trips typically?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, for long distances. For example, last weekend I drove 50 kilometers into the mountains.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you find the experience of traveling in the car this time?

**Speaker 2:**
I felt very comfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
Was the ride smooth?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, very smooth. The driver’s skills were good.

**Speaker 1:**
In what ways?

**Speaker 2:**
The driver was calm and didn't rush. He drove slowly and carefully.

**Speaker 1:**
If you had to choose, what type of car do you prefer for your travels? For example, an SUV, an electric car, or a performance car?

**Speaker 2:**
I prefer performance cars.

**Speaker 1:**
Why is that?

**Speaker 2:**
Because I don't like the sound that electric cars make. It's not pleasant to me.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you mean the high-tech sound they produce?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it sounds a bit sci-fi.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you drive yourself? If so, how would you rate your driving skills?

**Speaker 2:**
I don't drive, but if I did, I think I would be a good driver.

**Speaker 1:**
Now, let's watch this video. If anything stands out to you or makes you uncomfortable, feel free to mention it. I'll also ask you some questions during the video.

**Speaker 1:**
Is it the environment or the surroundings that you find concerning?

**Speaker 1:**
When a vehicle approaches from behind, does it make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think this is a normal occurrence?

**Speaker 1:**
How do you feel before starting a drive?

**Speaker 1:**
What do you feel when the car moves forward?

**Speaker 1:**
If the driver accelerates in a straight line, how does that make you feel?

**Speaker 1:**
Does it affect your sense of comfort and safety?

**Speaker 1:**
What about when a large vehicle suddenly appears?

**Speaker 1:**
How do you feel when crossing the street and the driver handles the car well?

**Speaker 1:**
Why do you think the driver’s skills are good?
**Speaker 1:**
When the large vehicle suddenly entered the lane, what was your reaction?

**Speaker 2:**
I tried to assist from inside the car.

**Speaker 1:**
When crossing the street, why did the driver fail to reach the red light safely? Was it a technical issue?

**Speaker 2:**
It seemed like a technical issue. The driver's actions didn't align with the traffic signals.

**Speaker 1:**
Does this situation relate to pedestrians and traffic signs? How did this experience affect your perception of safety?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it does. The buildings and road standards might have played a role. I noticed the driver engaged in some risky behaviors during the experiment, like checking the route on his phone multiple times. How do you think driving can be made safer?

**Speaker 1:**
In our experiment, we observed that certain driving behaviors could be improved for safety. How did you feel about the driver's actions during the experiment?

**Speaker 2:**
It gave me a sense of constant alertness, anticipating potential dangers. Even though the driver was supposed to give way to non-motorized vehicles, the narrow lanes made it challenging. Non-motorized vehicles often pushed us towards the motorized lanes, creating dangerous situations.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you often encountered sudden appearances of vehicles from the right, forcing you to swerve left, sometimes into the path of larger vehicles. This sounds very dangerous.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. It felt very unsafe. When riding with others, what behaviors make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 1:**
Other drivers often check their phones, which is concerning. How do you define safety in driving?

**Speaker 2:**
Safety in driving means maintaining control and avoiding risky behaviors. Speeding is a major concern, but bumps and jolts are less of an issue for me unless they are severe.

**Speaker 1:**
Did the driver do anything today that made you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really, it was okay. But generally, what behaviors from drivers or passengers make you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 1:**
Smoking, talking excessively, or playing loud music can be very distracting and uncomfortable.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I prefer a quiet environment. If everyone is talking, it makes the car ride even noisier and more stressful.

**Speaker 1:**
I understand. So, you value a comfortable and quiet ride.
**Speaker 1:** So, you prefer a quiet environment, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, if everyone is chatting, it can get even noisier in the car, which is already a confined space.

**Speaker 1:** I understand. How do you define comfort in a car?

**Speaker 2:** Comfort? Well, I think it includes things like the car seat's backrest and the headrest. For example, if the headrest moves back and forth with the car's bumps, it can be hard to sleep. If the car is shaking, it feels like a cradle, but if my head keeps moving, it's uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:** So, you prefer an environment where you can sleep, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. It gives me a cradle-like feeling, but only if my head stays still.

**Speaker 1:** Do you have any other thoughts on what defines comfort in a car?

**Speaker 2:** The backrest is important. Some backrests can't be adjusted backward, which affects the ability to relax and sleep. Also, if the seat is narrow and my legs are long, it can be uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:** Mainly, it's about personal space and comfort, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:** What do you think makes a driver professional? What qualities or skills do they need to have?

**Speaker 2:** They don't need to be overly enthusiastic, but they should always follow the rules and be consistent.

**Speaker 1:** What do you think is the biggest difference between a new driver and an experienced one?

**Speaker 2:** The biggest difference is their respect for the rules. Experienced drivers are more aware of and adhere to the rules.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think today's driver is experienced or a novice?

**Speaker 2:** I think today's driver is very knowledgeable about the rules.

**Speaker 1:** In what ways do you think autonomous cars will never be able to match human drivers, no matter how advanced they become?

**Speaker 2:** There are some decisions that require flexibility. For example, if there's a choice to be made, a human might choose differently than an autonomous car. 

**Speaker 1:** Can you give an example?

**Speaker 2:** For instance, if you're slightly late and need to decide whether to take a right or left turn, a human might choose based on the situation, but an autonomous car might not make the same choice. It might stick to a predetermined path.

**Speaker 1:** So, you think autonomous cars lack the flexibility that humans have in making decisions?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, humans can make decisions based on their judgment, while autonomous cars might make random or less optimal choices.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think there are other areas where autonomous cars might struggle compared to human drivers?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, in daily traffic situations, their judgment might not always be accurate. They might misinterpret certain conditions.
**Speaker 1:**
Do you think that autonomous driving randomly chooses other aspects? And what about the daily traffic conditions on the road? Some judgments might not be accurate.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, there have been instances where the system misidentified objects. For example, there was a news story where it mistook a barrier for a road.

**Speaker 1:**
So, do you think today's driving is done by an autonomous system or a human driver? I think today it's a human driving, right? Why do you think it's a human driving? Because the driver is filming, right? Yes, you can continue. If today's car was autonomously driven and the driver was just a safety officer simulating driving, would your experience be different? Would you feel less secure? Yes, I wouldn't feel comfortable. Why is that? Because I feel the system isn't accurate enough. It can't even recognize people correctly, let alone other objects.

**Speaker 1:**
Were there any moments today that made you feel like the car wasn't driven by a human? Any specific instances?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I felt like a real person was driving the car.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you define the intelligence of an autonomous driving system?

**Speaker 2:**
It should be able to recognize traffic lights, depth, and other signals.

**Speaker 2:**
For example, if there's an obstacle ahead, it should start detecting it and recognize what's around it. It should avoid obstacles and be aware of other vehicles, like a truck approaching from behind. It should also adjust to strong sunlight and other environmental factors.

**Speaker 1:**
Does it adjust the seat based on your body type or other factors?

**Speaker 1:**
As a pedestrian, how do you recognize the intentions of vehicles at an intersection without traffic lights? For example, whether they will stop, go through, or turn?

**Speaker 2:**
I can't always tell immediately. I usually just stay away from them.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you wait for all the cars to pass before you cross? I wait and observe their decisions before making my own. You prefer to watch and then proceed step by step, right? Yes, I wait until about 80% of the cars have passed, and when I feel it's safe, I cross. I judge whether they pose a threat to me before proceeding.
**Speaker 1:** When about 80% of the cars have passed, I make sure that the remaining ones don't pose a significant danger to me. If I determine that it's safe, I proceed. I assess whether a car might be a threat to me. If I feel it's dangerous, I wait until it's safe to go.

**Speaker 2:** Alright, that covers most of the questions we had for today's interview. Do you have any questions or suggestions for us?

**Speaker 1:** No, I don't have any.

**Speaker 2:** Okay, then I'll go ahead and stop the recording.
