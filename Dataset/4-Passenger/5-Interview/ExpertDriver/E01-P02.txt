**Speaker 1:**
Generally, we conduct both short and long tests. The short tests usually last about 10 to 20 minutes.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's right.

**Speaker 1:**
So, for this experiment, how did you find our vehicle?

**Speaker 2:**
It was very good.

**Speaker 1:**
Great. Did you feel any discomfort at any point?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I didn't.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think about the driver's driving skills?

**Speaker 2:**
They were good.

**Speaker 1:**
If you had a choice, what type of car would you prefer for traveling? For example, an off-road vehicle, an SUV, a gasoline car, an electric car, or a regular car? And why would you choose an electric car?

**Speaker 2:**
It just feels more comfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you drive often?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I do.

**Speaker 1:**
How would you rate your own driving skills?

**Speaker 2:**
They're okay, I guess.

**Speaker 1:**
Now, we're going to watch this video. If you have any thoughts or experiences to share during the video, feel free to speak up. For example, if you feel uncomfortable at any point or have any opinions, just let us know.

**Speaker 2:**
Sure, I will.

**Speaker 1:**
For instance, when we encounter a turn, do you feel anything specific?

**Speaker 2:**
No, nothing in particular.

**Speaker 1:**
Earlier, we saw some cyclists passing by. Did you notice any issues with the way we handled that situation?

**Speaker 2:**
No, it seemed fine.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think the driver did a good job?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was okay.

**Speaker 1:**
Is there anything the driver could do to make the ride more comfortable for you or other passengers?

**Speaker 2:**
No, the driver seemed quite familiar with the route and handled it well.

**Speaker 1:**
When the driver transitioned from the side road to the main road, how did you feel about that?

**Speaker 2:**
It was quite smooth.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think it was safe and reasonable?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel any discomfort or lack of safety during the ride?

**Speaker 2:**
No, everything was fine.

**Speaker 1:**
When the driver moved from the right lane to the left lane, did you notice anything?

**Speaker 2:**
It felt a bit fast, but it was okay.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel the car was going too fast?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, sometimes it felt a bit too fast, especially when I saw motorcycles passing by.
**Speaker 1:** So, what do you feel when you see a motorcycle? Do you think it's too fast or dangerous?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, every time I see a motorcycle, I feel it's somewhat dangerous.

**Speaker 1:** You mean, when you see a motorcycle, you feel it's dangerous because it's fast and the rider might be driving recklessly?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because they are usually fast and often drive erratically.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think the driver reacts to this behavior in any way?

**Speaker 2:** I would hope the driver takes some actions to make me feel safer and more comfortable.

**Speaker 1:** Like what kind of actions?

**Speaker 2:** Maybe lightly tapping the brakes or keeping their foot near the brake pedal.

**Speaker 1:** And being prepared for any sudden changes?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:** Was there any issue during this drive?

**Speaker 2:** This time was better, but the first time, they seemed to swerve occasionally, and sometimes they had to make sudden turns or U-turns.

**Speaker 1:** So, the first time they made a U-turn?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, sometimes there were sudden maneuvers.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think the driver handled the situation well?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, they did manage it well.

**Speaker 1:** How do you think they handled the turns?

**Speaker 2:** It wasn't always perfect.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think they slowed down or observed the situation in advance?

**Speaker 2:** They probably did.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think they could have done better?

**Speaker 2:** I think they drove quite well.

**Speaker 1:** So, you think they drove well?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, but in city traffic, especially when making right turns, you often encounter pedestrians, bicycles, or other vehicles.

**Speaker 1:** If you were driving, would you prioritize avoiding these obstacles?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, but sometimes it's hard to see everything clearly.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think this is a risky situation?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, especially if there are children around.

**Speaker 1:** It seems like they made a U-turn and got back on the main road right in front of us. Do you think our driver slowed down appropriately? How was the distance?

**Speaker 2:** The speed wasn't very fast.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about the deceleration process? Do you remember a delivery driver passing by, and we were on the right side?

**Speaker 2:** If there were no other cars, it should be fine.

**Speaker 1:** That's your personal feeling?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because we were always behind them.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think honking was a good idea?

**Speaker 2:** It can remind the delivery driver not to veer to the left, right?

**Speaker 1:** If it were you, would you do the same?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, or...
**Speaker 1:** What do you think is the best part?

**Speaker 2:** Can you remind the delivery truck not to veer to the left?

**Speaker 1:** If it's just you, you can.

**Speaker 2:** Or I could choose to keep a greater distance from it, maybe move a bit more to the left, so I don't get in its way.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think this is something a driver needs to pay attention to?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it's something to be aware of. The driver might think the speed is fine, but the person should be able to pass because of the space here.

**Speaker 1:** Right, so you think his behavior is reasonable, or would you prefer to be more cautious?

**Speaker 2:** I might look up the original text and be ready to place an order if needed.

**Speaker 1:** When there are two cars coming from the opposite direction, it's a scenario that requires attention.

**Speaker 1:** It's not necessarily a problem, but do you feel it is?

**Speaker 2:** It shouldn't be.

**Speaker 1:** Do you feel comfortable with this turn?

**Speaker 2:** This area seems a bit too congested.

**Speaker 1:** And there are quite a few cars.

**Speaker 2:** I feel a bit lucky with that set.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think the driver can avoid this situation with better driving?

**Speaker 1:** Do you think it's because he turned too sharply?

**Speaker 1:** Like this turn.

**Speaker 1:** He needs to pay attention to the vehicle in front. We are following him closely. Would you prefer to keep a bit more distance?

**Speaker 1:** Do you think the current distance is reasonable?

**Speaker 1:** Do you think this distance is too close?

**Speaker 1:** Do you feel there's a bit of skill involved here?

**Speaker 1:** Because there's a car on the side.

**Speaker 1:** So, handling this turn safely is crucial.

**Speaker 2:** I don't know if he looked, but in general, you should check the left side in such situations.

**Speaker 1:** How do you feel about his turn? Was it smooth?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, overall it was smooth. The turn was...

**Speaker 1:** Did the turn make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:** There were some moments, but overall it was fine.

**Speaker 1:** Was there any noticeable acceleration or deceleration?

**Speaker 2:** Not really, it seemed quite steady.

**Speaker 1:** When approaching a large truck or bus, how do you feel?

**Speaker 2:** A bit of pressure.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, a sense of pressure.

**Speaker 2:** I would let them go first.

**Speaker 1:** So you might yield to them.

**Speaker 1:** There's someone coming out here.

**Speaker 1:** When approaching a large vehicle and someone comes out, how do you feel?
**Speaker 1:**
You might need to yield when interacting with other drivers.

**Speaker 1:**
There's a person coming out from here.

**Speaker 1:**
They are close to this large vehicle, and as this person comes out, they...

**Speaker 1:**
You think they might not have made any obvious maneuvers.

**Speaker 2:**
It seems like there's not much you can do, just keep an eye on them, and then suddenly they come over.

**Speaker 1:**
You need to be prepared.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, you might need to be ready at any moment.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think that when making this turn, it's more obvious, and his brother passed by?

**Speaker 2:**
With more experience, he might predict that a new driver won't create a problem.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, you think it's a sign of a confident, experienced driver.

**Speaker 2:**
But if it were me, I might let them go first and then proceed.

**Speaker 1:**
So you think this is a result of his consideration.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I think he must have considered and predicted the other person's actions.

**Speaker 1:**
If it were you, you would...

**Speaker 2:**
What?

**Speaker 1:**
When the driver was driving, he saw from a distance.

**Speaker 2:**
Did he? Remind me.

**Speaker 1:**
He might have reminded too early or too late. Just now, there was a moment when he needed to accelerate.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think that when someone crossed the road, it felt dangerous?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but he might be more familiar with the area, so he didn't react strongly.

**Speaker 1:**
He drove quite skillfully.

**Speaker 1:**
Just now...

**Speaker 2:**
Did the driver seem to use the horn?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes.

**Speaker 2:**
Usually, in such situations...

**Speaker 1:**
Earlier, it was mentioned that larger vehicles might need more acceleration, and here, the driver should start in the middle. Do you think this behavior is good?

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel uncomfortable with his driving?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think he maintained a good distance from the large vehicle? How did you feel about the U-turn he made? It was quite obvious because it was a green light, and he made a large turn.

**Speaker 2:**
I felt like he might hit something.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel it was more challenging in winter? Would you prefer if he made a slight turn first and then a full turn after the pedestrians had crossed?

**Speaker 2:**
Not necessarily, just a quick check would be fine. Why? Do you think there might be some work ahead that requires attention?

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think the driver's maneuvers made you feel uncomfortable or unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**
Mainly at the turning points.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, he should have been more gentle with the steering, and he pressed the horn a bit too hard.
**Speaker 1:**
So, at that turn, there were a lot of pedestrians, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. There were quite a few people there.

**Speaker 1:**
Right, he should have been more cautious. You lightly pressed the horn, and then a bit more firmly. Let's take a closer look at that.

**Speaker 1:**
1621.

**Speaker 1:**
So, around here, you felt he was being too aggressive. We pressed the horn lightly, and it should have been at this spot.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you think he should have handled it better?

**Speaker 2:**
He should have paused a bit here and waited for the pedestrian to cross. It seemed like the pedestrian was distracted, maybe on their phone.

**Speaker 1:**
And what about the oncoming traffic?

**Speaker 1:**
There was another instance...

**Speaker 1:**
This might have been the second day after installation, but let's not worry about that for now. Besides this scenario, did you notice any other dangerous maneuvers by the driver?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you think he could drive more safely?

**Speaker 2:**
Overall, he seemed a bit reckless. For example, if there was a car in front, he would honk and then just weave through traffic. He could be more cautious and patient, especially in heavy traffic or tricky situations.

**Speaker 1:**
When you usually ride with other drivers, what behaviors make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**
It's not about blaming anyone, but I feel uncomfortable when drivers are erratic, like constantly switching lanes or driving aggressively. It can be unsettling.

**Speaker 1:**
So, generally speaking, you don't feel unsafe when riding with others?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really. It doesn't usually make me feel unsafe, but it might be concerning for pedestrians.

**Speaker 1:**
What behaviors do you think could endanger pedestrians?

**Speaker 2:**
Like we discussed, especially at night, when a car makes a right turn at a red light without checking properly. Sometimes, you can't see if there are pedestrians crossing, and it can be dangerous if someone suddenly appears.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think there's a way to improve this?

**Speaker 2:**
I'm not sure. It seems tricky. Maybe better awareness and caution at intersections, especially at night.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, just being more attentive in such situations.

**Speaker 1:**
And about the driver’s habit of honking...

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it felt unnecessary at times.
**Speaker 1:** So, how did you feel about the overall driving experience?

**Speaker 2:** I felt like I had to be cautious and pay attention to the situation.

**Speaker 1:** Did the driver's habit of frequently using the horn make you uncomfortable, or did it just make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:** It seemed like the driver was constantly taking detours and making sudden turns, which made me feel uneasy.

**Speaker 1:** Besides that, was there anything else the driver did that made you feel uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Not really, but those sudden maneuvers were quite unsettling.

**Speaker 1:** In your opinion, what makes a good or professional driver?

**Speaker 2:** I think a good driver is someone who considers the comfort of the passengers. For example, braking gently instead of making sudden stops.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think the driver we had was professional or just an average driver?

**Speaker 2:** I'm not sure.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think there's a difference between a professional driver and a good driver?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, a professional driver has good technical skills, but a good driver also considers the feelings of others, including passengers and other drivers on the road.

**Speaker 1:** What do you think is the biggest difference between an experienced driver and a novice driver?

**Speaker 2:** I think it's mainly about confidence. As a novice driver, I tend to hesitate when changing lanes or let others go first. An experienced driver might be more assertive in such situations.

**Speaker 1:** So, you usually let others go first when merging?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I prefer to let them go first, but some experienced drivers might not do that.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think there are aspects of driving that autonomous vehicles will never be able to replicate?

**Speaker 2:** I haven't experienced autonomous vehicles myself, but I think they might struggle with complex road conditions that require human judgment.

**Speaker 1:** Based on your understanding, do you think the car we were in was being driven by a person or was it on autopilot?

**Speaker 2:** It felt like the driver was trying to make it look like they were driving, but it might have been on autopilot.
**Speaker 1:** Do you think the car we just saw was being driven by a person or was it on autopilot? If you felt the driver was just pretending and the car was actually on autopilot, why do you think that?

**Speaker 2:** If it was a machine, it would probably stop when encountering a pedestrian. But in reality, an experienced driver might not anticipate the pedestrian's movement in time.

**Speaker 1:** So, you believe that an autonomous vehicle might be more cautious.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because it's programmed to be cautious and follow certain protocols when it detects something.

**Speaker 1:** If I told you that the car we were talking about was actually on autopilot, with the driver just acting as a safety monitor, how would that compare to your usual experience as a passenger?

**Speaker 2:** It felt no different from being driven by a human. Or maybe there were some subtle signs that it wasn't a human driver.

**Speaker 1:** If you were a pedestrian crossing a street without traffic signals, how would you judge the intentions of a non-motorized vehicle, like a bicycle, or a car? How would you determine the driver's intentions?

**Speaker 2:** I would look at the speed and whether the vehicle is preparing to stop or slow down. If it stops, I would cross. If it doesn't, I would wait for it to pass before crossing.

**Speaker 1:** So, you wouldn't just rush across regardless of the vehicle's actions. You would approach cautiously and observe?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I would observe and look for an opportunity to cross safely.

**Speaker 1:** If the vehicle doesn't stop, you would let it pass first?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I would wait for it to pass.

**Speaker 1:** And if both of you hesitate and stop at the same time?

**Speaker 2:** If the vehicle stops, I would proceed to cross.

**Speaker 1:** What if both of you start moving again at the same time?

**Speaker 2:** I would watch the vehicle closely. If it starts to slow down or stop, I would cross. Otherwise, I would wait.

**Speaker 1:** Our interview is concluding. The driver we discussed has been driving for 25 years and is a professional.

**Speaker 2:** I really thought it was a human driver. I didn't notice any significant difference.

**Speaker 1:** So, even if it was an autonomous vehicle, you didn't feel much difference compared to a human driver.
