**Speaker 1:**
Before we play this video, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your usual travel habits. Do you often travel by car?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I do.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you usually take long trips or short trips?

**Speaker 2:**
Mostly short trips.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, how did you find the experience of riding in our vehicle for this experiment?

**Speaker 2:**
It was very comfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
What aspects made it comfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
The driver's skills were quite good.

**Speaker 1:**
How could you tell the driver was skilled?

**Speaker 2:**
The ride was smooth.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you mean the speed was consistent, or there were no sudden bumps?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was smooth in terms of speed and overall comfort.

**Speaker 1:**
So, there were no sudden accelerations or decelerations?

**Speaker 2:**
Exactly, no sudden accelerations or decelerations. The road wasn't perfectly smooth, but the driver's handling made it comfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
So, the driver's operation was steady?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
If you had a choice, what type of car would you prefer for travel? For example, a sedan or an SUV?

**Speaker 2:**
A sedan.

**Speaker 1:**
Why do you prefer a sedan?

**Speaker 2:**
It feels more stable.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you prefer gasoline cars or electric cars?

**Speaker 2:**
I prefer gasoline cars.

**Speaker 1:**
Why do you prefer gasoline cars?

**Speaker 2:**
They have stronger power and you don't have to worry about the battery running out suddenly. Also, for long trips, they can go further.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you drive yourself often?

**Speaker 2:**
I have a car, but I drive only occasionally.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you usually travel as a passenger?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes.

**Speaker 1:**
How would you rate your own driving skills?

**Speaker 2:**
I'd say my driving is average.

**Speaker 1:**
Now, I'll play the video of our recent drive. If you find it inconvenient to watch from your current position, feel free to move your chair. During the video, if you notice any moments that change your experience, please let me know. I will pause the video at certain points to ask about your feelings at those times.

**Speaker 2:**
Alright, let's start.
**Speaker 1:** At any point, feel free to let me know if you have any questions. I will pause the video at certain points to ask about your feelings at that moment. Shall we start by collecting some extreme data? The front processor has the forward architecture, and then we immediately turn right. How did you feel about the driver's start? In terms of speed?

**Speaker 2:** At the start...

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel?

**Speaker 2:** It was fine.

**Speaker 1:** A normal start, right? There are many turns here. How do you think the driver handled the turns?

**Speaker 2:** It would be better if the turns were a bit tighter.

**Speaker 1:** You felt the turns were a bit wide, and he got close to the car next to him?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, he got a bit close to the other car.

**Speaker 1:** Were you worried he might hit the car next to him?

**Speaker 2:** No, I felt his skills were good enough.

**Speaker 1:** When did you start feeling confident about his skills? What made you think he was a good driver?

**Speaker 2:** When he was turning, I noticed he checked for other vehicles.

**Speaker 1:** So, the driver was looking around, and you observed that, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, but not always, just a quick glance.

**Speaker 1:** We are approaching an intersection, and then we will turn right. How do you think the driver handled it?

**Speaker 2:** I think he did fine.

**Speaker 1:** Did you pay attention to the oncoming traffic?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I did. There were very few cars.

**Speaker 1:** So, you weren't worried because there were no cars?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:** How did the driver handle the turn? You can evaluate based on speed or the angle of the turn.

**Speaker 2:** I think he could have stayed a bit more to the right.

**Speaker 1:** You wanted him to move a bit more to the right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, if he had turned a bit earlier, it would have been better.

**Speaker 1:** Were you worried he might hit the pole on the side if he didn't turn earlier?

**Speaker 2:** Not really, but the angle seemed a bit too wide.

**Speaker 1:** Why didn't you use the handle? Were you not nervous?

**Speaker 2:** No, I wasn't nervous or scared. I just thought it would be better that way.

**Speaker 1:** Did you worry about the driver hitting an electric bike or a parked car on the side road?

**Speaker 2:** No, the driver had already slowed down.

**Speaker 1:** You noticed the driver slowing down?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, and I wasn't worried about the distance either.
**Speaker 1:**
Oh, did you notice that the driver slowed down? And were you not worried about the distance?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because given the distance and speed, he could stop quickly if needed.

**Speaker 1:**
I see. So, you weren't too concerned about the distance. When you were about to move to the left, did you notice the oncoming tricycle?

**Speaker 2:**
From the picture, it might look like that, but from inside the car, it was quite a large area.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you weren't worried because of the distance, right? How did you feel about the driver's overall performance on the side road?

**Speaker 2:**
It was good. The speed wasn't too fast.

**Speaker 1:**
When merging onto the main road, did you check the vehicles behind?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't pay much attention to that.

**Speaker 1:**
So, how did you feel about the driver's merging onto the main road? Was it safe?

**Speaker 2:**
I think he could have merged first and then checked the left mirror before moving further.

**Speaker 1:**
Actually, he shouldn't have moved directly to the far left. Did you notice that at the time?

**Speaker 2:**
I thought as long as there were no cars, it was fine.

**Speaker 1:**
If you had noticed, would you have used the handle to signal? Would you have felt it was unsafe or uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it would have been unsafe.

**Speaker 1:**
During the straight driving segment, did you have any particular feelings?

**Speaker 2:**
The road ahead was quite spacious.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it was smooth, right? Was the driver's speed consistent and reasonable?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was reasonable, except for one part.

**Speaker 1:**
Which part?

**Speaker 2:**
The U-turn.

**Speaker 1:**
You mean when coming back?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the U-turn was too close to the pedestrian path.

**Speaker 1:**
Let's take a look. Do you mean here?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, let's look again. He didn't drive over it, but it was very close.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you felt the front wheels were too close to the pedestrian path, right? Did you feel it was unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but from inside the car, it looked different than in the picture.

**Speaker 1:**
From inside the car, did it look particularly close to the pedestrian path?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it looked very close from inside the car.
**Speaker 1:**
When you were in the car, did it seem like you were very close to the sidewalk?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, from inside the car, it felt very close.

**Speaker 1:**
When the driver was making a U-turn, did you hear the reverse signal? Were you worried that the car might hit the greenery? Can we look at this for a few seconds? Were you concerned about that at the time?

**Speaker 2:**
Why would I be? There were leaves in front, weren't there?

**Speaker 1:**
But wasn't there something blocking underneath? Were you worried it might hit that?

**Speaker 2:**
Well, the car made several beeping sounds, so I wasn't really worried.

**Speaker 1:**
So you weren't concerned at the time, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Right, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you pay attention to the cars coming from behind?

**Speaker 2:**
Sometimes I did, but mostly I was looking forward.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about the driver's U-turn, aside from driving over the sidewalk?

**Speaker 2:**
The U-turn was a bit wide.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, it was a bit wide.

**Speaker 2:**
Maybe because the road itself wasn't very wide.

**Speaker 1:**
But you weren't worried about safety, right? Did you feel uncomfortable because the turn was too wide?

**Speaker 2:**
Maybe because I'm used to riding in cars, I didn't feel much.

**Speaker 1:**
So it was within your acceptable range, right? Did you feel the driver had control over the car when going over bumpy sections like manhole covers or speed bumps?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, there were a few manhole covers on the main road. I felt a slight bump, but it was fine. Did the driver slow down or brake gently to ensure passenger comfort?

**Speaker 1:**
Because the speed wasn't very fast, I didn't feel much. Did you notice if the driver deliberately slowed down?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't really notice that.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel the car accelerating?

**Speaker 2:**
This car didn't accelerate very quickly.

**Speaker 1:**
When turning right, were you worried about electric bikes suddenly appearing?

**Speaker 2:**
At that section of the road, the driver glanced over.

**Speaker 1:**
Oh, you noticed the driver looking?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, he checked and then made the turn safely.

**Speaker 1:**
Did the driver slow down when crossing the pedestrian crossing? Did you feel it in the car?

**Speaker 2:**
He looked to make sure no one was there before proceeding.
**Speaker 1:**
Did he slow down when he approached the crosswalk? Did you feel anything when you were in the car at that intersection?

**Speaker 2:**
He basically checked to see if there were no people.

**Speaker 1:**
After passing 300 meters, you reached the destination. During the entire drive, did he actively avoid pedestrians and other vehicles?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, for example, he would slow down when there were pedestrians. If there were no pedestrians, he would keep a safe distance.

**Speaker 1:**
Did he steer away, like moving a bit to the left if there were pedestrians on the right? Did you notice that?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I did notice that.

**Speaker 1:**
So, if there were pedestrians on the right, the driver would steer to the left to avoid them. Did you observe this?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, he would definitely do that.

**Speaker 1:**
So, the driver did avoid pedestrians and other vehicles, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, drivers must be cautious.

**Speaker 1:**
Oh, there's a garbage truck ahead that seems to have dropped a bag of trash. Did you notice that?

**Speaker 2:**
That wasn't trash; it was just an empty garbage bag.

**Speaker 1:**
It was empty, right? So, there was no need to worry.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, if it had trash in it, the bag wouldn't be so light.

**Speaker 1:**
We saw it on the surveillance footage, and we wanted to ask about it. So, there was no concern at that moment, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the bag would scatter in the wind. We were about to reach the destination.

**Speaker 1:**
Then, at the traffic light, the driver made a right turn. How did you feel about his turn?

**Speaker 2:**
It was normal.

**Speaker 1:**
Normal, okay.

**Speaker 2:**
He followed the traffic signals.

**Speaker 1:**
When passing larger vehicles like buses or trucks, were you worried that a pedestrian, car, or electric bike might suddenly appear in front of the car?

**Speaker 2:**
No, because we didn't encounter such situations.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you never worried about that?

**Speaker 2:**
No, never.

**Speaker 1:**
When passing an intersection where the view is blocked by another vehicle, were you concerned about potential accidents?

**Speaker 2:**
No, because there wasn't much traffic on the road at that time.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you weren't worried about a car or person suddenly appearing from behind the obstruction?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I wasn't worried. I think it was a gate or something, but no, I wasn't concerned. Did the driver slow down?

**Speaker 1:**
Do you remember if he slowed down?

**Speaker 2:**
I don't think he slowed down, but the car wasn't going very fast either.

**Speaker 1:**
So, there was no need to slow down?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, even if someone appeared, the car could stop quickly because it wasn't going very fast.

**Speaker 1:**
As you were about to reach the destination, the driver made a left turn at the end of the road. How did you feel about the speed bumps?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't feel much; the car handled them well.
**Speaker 1:** As we were approaching the store, the driver had to make a left turn at the end of the road. How did you feel when the driver went over the speed bumps? This area isn't near a school, so it should be relatively smooth.

**Speaker 2:** I didn't notice anything unusual. It felt normal.

**Speaker 1:** Did you pay attention to any specific areas? This is a relatively complex intersection with multiple directions.

**Speaker 2:** Let me think. Yes, I did notice a couple of electric bikes nearby, but nothing out of the ordinary.

**Speaker 1:** So, there were two electric bikes, but you didn't feel anything special, just normal driving?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, there was enough space on my side. It felt normal.

**Speaker 1:** So, the turn was normal, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because there was enough space. The lane was clear, so it was fine.

**Speaker 1:** So, it wasn't too close to the white car, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, there was still some distance. We were approaching the destination.

**Speaker 1:** How was the driver's speed during this segment?

**Speaker 2:** The speed was normal.

**Speaker 1:** Normal. Did you notice any speed limit signs? Did the driver exceed the speed limit at any point?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't pay attention to the speed limit signs.

**Speaker 1:** You didn't notice. But did you feel the driver was driving fast?

**Speaker 2:** No, the driver wasn't driving fast. There were some slight bumps, but nothing major.

**Speaker 1:** Did the driver brake gently? Did you feel any sudden jolts?

**Speaker 2:** The braking was gentle. There were no sudden stops or starts.

**Speaker 1:** The driver made a slight left turn. Did you notice that?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I did. There was a bit of space there.

**Speaker 1:** And there were no cars coming from the opposite direction?

**Speaker 2:** Correct, no cars from the opposite direction.

**Speaker 1:** Did you notice the driver yielding to pedestrians?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, when the driver turned the steering wheel, it was clear they were yielding.

**Speaker 1:** As we approached the second street, there were some pedestrians on the side. Did you see if the driver was observing them and slowing down?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, the driver slowed down when turning. They were cautious.

**Speaker 1:** We are about to reach the destination. How do you think the driver handled yielding to pedestrians?

**Speaker 2:** The driver did well. They were considerate of the pedestrians.
**Speaker 1:** How did he handle it? Specifically, the right turn and yielding to pedestrians. What do you think about his performance?

**Speaker 2:** Pretty good. He did well. Yes, he was considerate of pedestrians. How should I put it? He didn't engage in dangerous driving.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about this section? This part is called "opposition." He wasn't driving fast, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. There were no other cars around.

**Speaker 1:** So, in such an open area, did you ever wish the driver would go a bit faster? Since there were no other cars, did you think about that?

**Speaker 2:** Honestly, I didn't think about it at the time.

**Speaker 1:** You didn't think about it?

**Speaker 2:** No, I didn't. When you see an open road, you just want to keep moving. Traffic jams make you feel frustrated.

**Speaker 1:** As long as the road conditions are good, it's fine, right?

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about that right turn just now?

**Speaker 2:** It was normal. He checked his mirrors.

**Speaker 1:** In 900 meters, we will reach our next point. Can I go back and ask a question? Sure, here it is. How did you feel about this section? There was a car about to start, and there were also two bicycles.

**Speaker 2:** I felt that he should have let the car go first.

**Speaker 1:** So, let the car go first, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, if I were the driver, I would have let the car go first. You can't just go ahead.

**Speaker 1:** But our driver went straight ahead. What do you think about that? Would it have been better if he had gone a bit slower?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I noticed that. He went ahead because there were no cars, so it was fine.

**Speaker 1:** Right.

**Speaker 2:** It's not that there were no cars; it's just that the road was clear. The open space made a difference.

**Speaker 1:** What do you think would have been the ideal action for the driver?

**Speaker 2:** I think the ideal action would have been to wait for the car and the bicycles to pass, and then proceed.

**Speaker 1:** So, we should have let the starting white car go first, and then the two bicycles, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, but it seemed like the car was turning. 

**Speaker 1:** Yes, it was about to start.

**Speaker 2:** He was changing lanes, how should I say it?

**Speaker 1:** Do you think the driver's action of going straight ahead was unsafe or uncomfortable for you?

**Speaker 1:** Did it make you feel unsafe? If it was safe, did it still make you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because he should have...

**Speaker 1:** It would have been better if he had gone a bit slower, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. Driving too fast can make you worry about collisions, right?
**Speaker 1:**
So, you think he should slow down a bit more, right? You feel that driving too fast makes you worry about potential collisions, correct? Slowing down feels safer, but his current speed is still acceptable.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. You got it.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you feel driving on this road? We're almost there.

**Speaker 2:**
Well, there aren't many cars.

**Speaker 1:**
Right, it's pretty quiet.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it's quite peaceful.

**Speaker 1:**
When you turn left here, what do you pay attention to? Mainly checking for oncoming traffic, right? So, you look to the left first, then to the right after you start turning. Is that correct?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, first look left, then right.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you think the driver handled the turn? Was it smooth?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was normal. When approaching the traffic light, how did the driver handle the sudden appearance of the bicycle?

**Speaker 1:**
He slowed down a bit.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, he slowed down a bit. I think he should have kept a bit more distance from the electric bike.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you think it would be better to slow down more or even stop to let it pass, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, stopping would be safer.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel unsafe or worried at that moment?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really, I don't get anxious easily.

**Speaker 1:**
Haha, were you worried about a collision or safety issues?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I wasn't.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you feel about the upcoming right turn? The curve seems quite wide. Did you check the left side?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I checked both sides.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think the driver handled the turn well?

**Speaker 2:**
As long as there are no cars, it's fine.

**Speaker 1:**
Now, he wants to change lanes, but there's a car coming from behind. The turn signal is on. How do you think the driver handled the U-turn at the traffic light?

**Speaker 2:**
I think he should stay in the correct lane.

**Speaker 1:**
Are you suggesting he should move to the main road?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, but there's no gap.

**Speaker 1:**
There's a green area here, this is the main road, and this is the service road.

**Speaker 2:**
He can't make the U-turn from the main road.

**Speaker 1:**
Our route is to take the service road. Besides that, how do you think the driver did overall?
**Speaker 1:**
So, how did you feel about the driver's performance overall, aside from that issue?

**Speaker 2:**
The speed wasn't very fast at the time.

**Speaker 1:**
Did it feel normal to you?

**Speaker 2:**
He might have driven onto the sidewalk, possibly.

**Speaker 1:**
Driving onto the sidewalk isn't good, right? Did you feel unsafe at any point?

**Speaker 2:**
At that moment, I felt it was okay as long as no one was around.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, let's continue.

**Speaker 2:**
There might have been something in front of the sidewalk.

**Speaker 1:**
Hold on a second, I need to deliver a charger to them. Give me a minute. Okay, so you think he drove onto the sidewalk during the U-turn? That's not good. Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
I feel like he shouldn't have made that turn.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you think he should have turned?

**Speaker 2:**
He should have taken a different route.

**Speaker 1:**
Let's review it again. He might have crossed the lane.

**Speaker 2:**
It seems like he crossed the lane.

**Speaker 1:**
He had to make that turn to get to the service area. How did you feel about that turn?

**Speaker 2:**
It seemed like he was driving against traffic.

**Speaker 1:**
That doesn't seem right.

**Speaker 2:**
I mean, his behavior was questionable.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, if he drove like that. How do you think the driver did overall?

**Speaker 2:**
The driver made the turn okay and didn't hit anything. Yes, there was another part where he didn't pass the test. After that, there was a right turn, and we parked. Do you have any strong impressions of that part? Anything that stood out to you?

**Speaker 2:**
When we were almost at the destination, the driver seemed a bit anxious and kept honking the horn.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel uncomfortable with the honking?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really. If it were me, I might have done the same if there was a slight traffic jam. It didn't feel too bad.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you think the honking wasn't a big deal?

**Speaker 2:**
It's not that it was bad, just a bit too impatient. For example, if the light turned green and then red again without moving, it would be better if he wasn't so anxious.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it would be better if he were less impatient, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
A few more questions: you didn't use the handle, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Correct, I didn't.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think the driver did anything dangerous during the drive?

**Speaker 2:**
He might have taken the turn too sharply when leaving the parking lot.
**Speaker 1:**
Were there any dangerous maneuvers during the entire drive?

**Speaker 2:**
Hmm, yes. When he was turning out of the driveway, he turned a bit too sharply and got too close to the other cars.

**Speaker 1:**
Are you referring to the initial turns right at the beginning? These few turns here, correct?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. When he was turning here, he got too close to the other cars.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you think he was too close to the other cars at this spot?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was a bit risky. He glanced over but still got too close.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you think there was a potential for a collision. Did he use the turn signal at that time?

**Speaker 2:**
I felt that if it were a more experienced driver, they might have handled it better.

**Speaker 1:**
It seemed normal to you?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, if I were driving, I wouldn't have gotten that close. It wasn't too close, but it could have been better.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you think this is an area for improvement?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, if he had turned a bit earlier, it would have been much better.

**Speaker 1:**
Were there any other places that felt dangerous to you?

**Speaker 2:**
Just that turn we mentioned earlier.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, we talked about that. How do you think driving can be made safer in general, not just for this driver?

**Speaker 2:**
By following the rules and regulations.

**Speaker 1:**
Following traffic rules. Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
Being courteous to pedestrians, especially in crowded areas like near schools.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, being aware of blind spots and using the horn when necessary.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
No, that's about it. Do you think today's driver followed these practices?

**Speaker 2:**
He might be inexperienced, but he didn't use the horn.

**Speaker 1:**
In which situations do you think he should have used the horn? Just give an example.

**Speaker 2:**
In blind spots, especially when there are large vehicles like buses blocking the view of pedestrians.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you think he should have used the horn in pedestrian blind spots?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because using the horn alerts others that a car is coming.

**Speaker 1:**
What behaviors from other drivers make you feel unsafe when you're a passenger?

**Speaker 2:**
For example, if the driver speeds up too quickly.
**Speaker 1:** So, when you're a passenger in someone else's car, what kind of behavior from the driver makes you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:** For example, if the driver suddenly accelerates.

**Speaker 1:** Especially if they speed up quickly and don't follow the rules. Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** Also, if they play with their phone or don't wear a seatbelt.

**Speaker 1:** Not wearing a seatbelt, got it. Anything else? Like making or taking calls while driving, holding the phone to their ear?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, holding the phone to make a call feels unsafe.

**Speaker 1:** Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** Driving with one hand on the wheel. They teach us to use both hands, right?

**Speaker 1:** Anything else? No? Okay. Have you noticed any other behaviors from drivers that make you uncomfortable, either psychologically or physically?

**Speaker 2:** Entering blind spots without warning, like not honking beforehand, makes me uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:** Does it make you feel uneasy?

**Speaker 2:** Actually, I don't feel much either way.

**Speaker 1:** Haha, so it doesn't really bother you?

**Speaker 2:** It would be better if they honked.

**Speaker 1:** How do you think a driver can make you feel more comfortable overall?

**Speaker 2:** Driving at the appropriate speed—fast when it should be fast, slow when it should be slow.

**Speaker 1:** Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** Being decisive, especially in heavy traffic or when there are many pedestrians.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think today's driver met your expectations? Did they do anything that made you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** I mostly worry about them driving too fast. Other than that, not much.

**Speaker 1:** So, did you feel okay with today's driver since they drove slowly?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, they drove at a reasonable speed. Anything else that made you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Oh, when they made that sharp turn earlier, the car felt awkward. Like I mentioned before.

**Speaker 1:** The turn was too wide, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, the turn was a bit too wide.

**Speaker 1:** Were you worried about hitting the curb or pedestrians?

**Speaker 2:** Not exactly, just that specific turn felt off.

**Speaker 1:** Was it the turn up ahead?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, that's the one. I felt they should have adjusted earlier.

**Speaker 1:** You think they should have adjusted their steering earlier?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it felt like they should have moved to the adjacent lane earlier and then turned.
**Speaker 1:** So, you think the lane change wasn't smooth, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it felt like he switched to the adjacent lane and then came back from the front. It just didn't feel right.

**Speaker 1:** Oh, you mean the turn wasn't smooth, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, this road feels awkward to handle.

**Speaker 1:** Oh, let's take a look.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, there's another lane here.

**Speaker 1:** Hmm, you think it should switch to this smaller lane, right? The one on the left?

**Speaker 2:** This part should be able to be enlarged.

**Speaker 1:** So, you want it to switch to this lane here, right? Not this part, but the other one. Hold on, let me rewind and check. Hmm, you can see here.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, see, there's a dashed line here. It seems like you can only switch to this lane, but there's no dashed line on the other side, so you can't go there.

**Speaker 1:** Oh, so you think it's a problem with the road setup, right? What kind of driver actions make you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** The driver's actions, well...

**Speaker 1:** Nothing specific? When you ride in other people's cars, are there any behaviors that make you uncomfortable? You mentioned driving too fast earlier. Are there any other behaviors that bother you?

**Speaker 2:** Also, in China...

**Speaker 1:** Not slowing down in blind spots, right? Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** No, that's about it.

**Speaker 1:** What do you think makes a good driver?

**Speaker 2:** First, following the rules.

**Speaker 1:** Following traffic rules.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, not running red lights.

**Speaker 1:** Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** And yielding at crosswalks.

**Speaker 1:** Yielding to pedestrians at crosswalks, or just not stopping on the crosswalk?

**Speaker 2:** I think it's better not to stop on the crosswalk. Anything else?

**Speaker 1:** No, that's it. Do you consider yourself a new driver or an experienced one?

**Speaker 2:** I think I'm a...

**Speaker 1:** New driver. What do you think is the biggest difference between you and an experienced driver?

**Speaker 2:** Maybe my anticipation isn't very good. You need to anticipate while driving, right?

**Speaker 1:** Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** I might drive slower because I'm afraid there might be someone in front.

**Speaker 1:** Driving too slow because you're worried about people in front. Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** No, that's about it.

**Speaker 1:** Have you heard about autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:** Not much before, but today I learned a lot, haha.

**Speaker 1:** What do you think autonomous driving can't do as well as a human driver?

**Speaker 2:** You mean what the car can't do?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, what the car can't do like a human.
**Speaker 1:** What aspects of driving can't be achieved by autonomous vehicles, like a human can?

**Speaker 2:** Driving? Are you saying the car can't do it?

**Speaker 1:** What? Yes, exactly. The car can't drive like a human. Autonomous driving can't match a human driver's capabilities.

**Speaker 2:** It might be something like, for example, if it's driving smoothly and suddenly someone jumps out in front of it. I feel like...

**Speaker 1:** You mean it suddenly accelerates?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, yes. For example, if it suddenly speeds up or something like that.

**Speaker 1:** Are you afraid the vehicle might lose control?

**Speaker 2:** No, it's not that. I'm more worried about people. If someone suddenly appears, the reaction time of the autonomous system might be a bit slow.

**Speaker 1:** So, you're saying autonomous driving can't react as quickly as a human can?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, there might be a delay.

**Speaker 1:** You mean the reaction speed is slower?

**Speaker 2:** Not exactly slow, but just a bit slower.

**Speaker 1:** Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** I feel like with autonomous driving, it follows traffic lights. For example, if the light turns green, it will go. But what if someone runs a red light? The car can recognize the light, but it might not recognize the person.

**Speaker 1:** So, you're worried that pedestrians might not follow the rules, and the autonomous system can't handle that?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. The car can distinguish between red and green lights, but if someone crosses against the light, it might not handle it well.

**Speaker 1:** So, you're afraid the autonomous car might violate traffic laws?

**Speaker 2:** No, I'm afraid people might violate traffic laws. For example, if a pedestrian crosses on a red light and the car doesn't see them.

**Speaker 1:** You're worried the car might hit a pedestrian who is breaking the law?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. Let me note that down. You're afraid it can't recognize such situations, right? Anything else?

**Speaker 2:** No, that's all. Do you think the recent trip was driven by a human or by an autonomous system?

**Speaker 1:** I felt like it was driven by a human. Why?

**Speaker 2:** Because I haven't experienced autonomous driving before. And...

**Speaker 1:** Yes, go on.

**Speaker 2:** I saw the driver's hand on the steering wheel, so I felt it was a human.

**Speaker 1:** You felt the driver's actions matched the vehicle's movements?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. Let me note that down. Anything else?

**Speaker 1:** No, that's all. Now, let's assume the recent trip was driven by an autonomous system, and the driver was just a safety operator pretending to drive. If you think about it that way, can you recall any details that might suggest it was autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:** I always felt it was human-driven, especially during turns. But if we assume it was autonomous and the driver was pretending, then...
**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about that turn? Let's assume it was an autonomous driving scenario, with the driver pretending to drive. What details made you think it might be autonomous driving?

**Speaker 1:** How did this experience differ from your usual driving experiences?

**Speaker 2:** I still need to distinguish that.

**Speaker 1:** So, there was no noticeable difference? If we assume it was autonomous driving, were there any details that made you think, "Is this really autonomous driving?" For example, was there a moment when you suddenly thought, "Is this being driven by a person?"

**Speaker 2:** At first, I felt it was.

**Speaker 1:** You felt it was driven by a person the whole time. Can you explain why you thought it was human-driven?

**Speaker 2:** I felt like the driver's hands were firmly on the steering wheel.

**Speaker 1:** In terms of the car's movement, like speed or handling certain situations, what made you think it was human-driven?

**Speaker 2:** I felt that if it were autonomous driving, it would have kept a bit more distance from pedestrians when turning.

**Speaker 1:** So, you think an autonomous car would keep a safer distance from pedestrians while turning?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it would probably keep a bit more distance from them.

**Speaker 1:** Were there any other indicators?

**Speaker 2:** In blind spots, I feel an autonomous car would automatically honk to alert others.

**Speaker 1:** Any other details?

**Speaker 2:** If it were autonomous, I think it would have accelerated a bit on that open stretch of road.

**Speaker 1:** So, you think an autonomous car would speed up on open roads. Any other observations?

**Speaker 2:** No, that's about it.

**Speaker 1:** One last question: As a pedestrian, when you need to cross an intersection without traffic lights, how do you judge the intentions of the oncoming vehicles?

**Speaker 2:** I usually wait until there are no cars.

**Speaker 1:** So, you don't rely on the cars to yield; you just wait until there are no cars to cross, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it depends on the type of intersection.

**Speaker 1:** An intersection without traffic lights—how do you judge if a car will let you cross?

**Speaker 2:** I wait until the car passes before I cross.

**Speaker 1:** So, you wait until all the cars have passed before crossing, or you cross when there are no cars in sight?

**Speaker 2:** Or if the car is still far away.

**Speaker 1:** So, you wait until there are no cars or until they are far away.
Speaker 1:
When there are no cars, quickly go through. Yes, that's right.

Speaker 2:
Or when the car is still quite far away.

Speaker 1:
Yes, wait until there are no cars or they are far away. That's all for our questions. Thank you very much for participating in our experiment today.
