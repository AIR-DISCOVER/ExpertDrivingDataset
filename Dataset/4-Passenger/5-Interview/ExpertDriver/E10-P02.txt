**Speaker 1:**
Hello, let's start with some simple questions. Do you often travel by car? No? Not really?

**Speaker 2:**
I usually take the subway.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you find our vehicle and driver during this experiment? Pretty good? How would you rate the driver's skills?

**Speaker 2:**
The vehicle was comfortable. As for the driver, I have a driver's license, but I don't drive often, so I can't really judge. But overall, it felt smooth.

**Speaker 1:**
If you had a choice, what type of car would you prefer? For example, an off-road vehicle, SUV, gasoline car, electric car, or sedan? Do you have any preferences?

**Speaker 2:**
A sedan, I guess. It's more comfortable. I don't drive much myself.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright. Now, let's review the video of our recent drive. As we watch, please point out any moments or sections where you felt uncomfortable, unsafe, or particularly good. Also, feel free to comment on the driver's performance. I'll ask you some questions based on different driving scenarios.

**Speaker 1:**
Here, the driver is making a right turn. How did you feel about this turn?

**Speaker 2:**
The driver was quite cautious.

**Speaker 1:**
Cautious?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, he waited for pedestrians and cyclists to pass before proceeding. The turn was smooth, unlike some drivers who brake suddenly. His speed control was good.

**Speaker 1:**
So, the driver was cautious, observing pedestrians and other vehicles, and only turned when the way was clear?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, and the start was smooth too.

**Speaker 1:**
Smooth in terms of speed?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, the speed was consistent, not too fast, and felt stable.

**Speaker 1:**
Stable meaning the speed was steady?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it seemed like he was familiar with the route, driving at a moderate speed.

**Speaker 1:**
Before the official experiment, there was a test drive, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I thought he might be unfamiliar, but it was fine.
**Speaker 1:** So, you mentioned the speed was quite slow.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it was during our initial 4G test drive.

**Speaker 1:** Did you have a test drive? I thought you were unfamiliar with it.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, we did. I thought he was unfamiliar too, but it was fine.

**Speaker 1:** Was it usually too slow?

**Speaker 2:** Not too slow, just very cautious.

**Speaker 1:** A cautious feeling, I see.

**Speaker 1:** So, we had a right turn or an entry into a side road. How did you feel about that process?

**Speaker 2:** It felt normal. We were driving on the side road, and then we entered the main road.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, he would enter the main road ahead.

**Speaker 2:** At that point, the speed increased. Looking at the map, it seemed like there were no other cars, so the speed suddenly picked up.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, the acceleration was noticeable.

**Speaker 2:** Right, the acceleration was fine since there were no other cars around.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel the acceleration inside the car?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I definitely felt it.

**Speaker 1:** Did the acceleration make you uncomfortable, or did it feel normal?

**Speaker 2:** It felt normal.

**Speaker 2:** After that, the ride was very smooth. I almost fell asleep at one point, even though you reminded us not to. The car was quite comfortable, and the vibrations weren't as noticeable as in other cars. It was very smooth.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think we could skip or fast-forward some parts?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, you can fast-forward. There wasn't much happening in the middle.

**Speaker 1:** We need to review this part.

**Speaker 2:** It was normal, right? He made it in one go.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, he made it in one go. During our previous tests, many drivers couldn't do it in one go.

**Speaker 2:** This 4G test was done in one go. I was worried he might need to adjust, but he did it well. His basic skills are good.

**Speaker 1:** If he had to reverse and adjust, would it have felt less impressive?

**Speaker 2:** Definitely. If he had to reverse and adjust, it would seem like the driver wasn't skilled.

**Speaker 1:** So, making it in one go made you feel the driver was skilled. After the U-turn, there was another acceleration. Did you feel that was fine?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it was fine. No issues there.

**Speaker 1:** We remind everyone not to fall asleep because the ride is so smooth.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, he was driving around the university...
**Speaker 1:** It seems like you were about to fall asleep during this part.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, the driver was so steady that we had to remind everyone not to fall asleep.

**Speaker 1:** So, he drove around the university a couple of times, right? Was it Tsinghua University?

**Speaker 2:** I don't think so, but he was very enthusiastic.

**Speaker 1:** I noticed some lag, so I closed a few apps. How did you find the steady speed during the drive?

**Speaker 2:** It was very comfortable, almost made me want to sleep. Very smooth.

**Speaker 1:** Were there any complex or dangerous situations today? Like cars passing by or pedestrians crossing the road?

**Speaker 2:** This was at Rizhao University Town. We drove around the university twice without any issues.

**Speaker 1:** I see. Did you notice anything specific at the entrance? It’s an unregulated entrance without traffic lights. Although the road conditions seemed good today, there were cars and pedestrians from all directions. How did you feel about the driver's handling at this entrance?

**Speaker 2:** As long as there are no sharp turns or sudden stops, I feel fine.

**Speaker 1:** Everything seemed normal?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, very good. I’ve experienced autonomous driving at Shougang, and I didn’t feel any tension.

**Speaker 1:** So, you’ve ridden in an autonomous vehicle before?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, for about 5 to 10 minutes, covering around 5 kilometers.

**Speaker 1:** As long as there are no sudden stops or rapid accelerations, you feel comfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, no sudden stops or rapid accelerations. As long as the driver isn’t in a hurry and there are no other cars suddenly cutting in, it doesn’t feel dangerous to me.

**Speaker 1:** So, you felt the driver was steady?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, although the trip took a bit longer. The distance was 18 kilometers, but it took about 21 minutes.

**Speaker 1:** So, it took about 3 minutes longer than expected?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, but it felt very safe overall.

**Speaker 1:** We should be on the return trip now, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, this should be the second day, and we’re heading back.

**Speaker 1:** It seems like there was no speeding.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, no speeding. It was quite interesting.

**Speaker 1:** In 450 meters, we’ll make a U-turn at the traffic light. We’re already on the return trip.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, the driver will make a turn soon and then head back.

**Speaker 1:** The driver seems very steady.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, very steady. I used to ride with NetEase drivers, and they were also very steady.
**Speaker 1:** So, you were saying that in situations like this, ride-hailing drivers usually speed up when the road is clear?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, they definitely speed up. They accelerate and then slow down just before reaching a traffic light. Some drivers are in a hurry and only slow down when they are very close to the car in front, often braking suddenly. I find that very annoying. But this driver is different; he drives steadily and doesn't rush.

**Speaker 1:** So, you're saying that on clear roads, ride-hailing drivers tend to accelerate and then suddenly decelerate, but this driver maintained a steady speed?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. He was just waiting for the traffic light to turn green. There's nothing much to it. When the light turned green, he continued driving smoothly.

**Speaker 1:** I see. So, you think this driver was very steady. How do you think the driving experience could be improved to make it safer or more comfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Honestly, I felt quite comfortable this time. There's nothing I would change.

**Speaker 1:** Besides this experience, what kind of driver behavior makes you feel unsafe when you're a passenger?

**Speaker 2:** Sudden acceleration, especially when overtaking. It can be quite scary on the highway when a driver suddenly overtakes without warning. Also, not slowing down when turning in the city.

**Speaker 1:** Not slowing down when turning?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, and speeding. On the highway, the speed limit is usually 120 km/h, but some drivers go up to 160 km/h. They might think it's normal, but it makes me nervous. Sudden braking is also alarming; it makes my heart skip a beat because it usually means something unexpected happened.

**Speaker 1:** Apart from safety concerns, are there any driver behaviors that make you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Road rage, like when drivers start cursing at other cars.

**Speaker 1:** So, emotional outbursts and cursing?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. It makes the ride very unpleasant.
**Speaker 2:**
What's that called? Road rage? Road rage is when you start cursing at others.

**Speaker 1:**
I don't usually curse.

**Speaker 2:**
It's like when someone cuts you off, and you go "blah blah blah," criticizing their driving. It's a way to vent your emotions. But if there's no one else in the car, maybe it's just the two of us, or sometimes there's no one else. And then...

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think...

**Speaker 2:**
Talking on the phone, yes, especially that. It makes me uncomfortable. I've encountered situations before the new traffic regulations were enforced, where you had to use a headset to make calls, otherwise, you'd get points deducted. Before that, people would drive with one hand on the wheel and the other holding the phone. Some would even send voice messages while driving. But after ride-hailing services became popular, I see it less often.

**Speaker 1:**
Okay, so what do you think makes a professional driver? What should they do?

**Speaker 2:**
They should manage their emotions well.

**Speaker 1:**
Manage their emotions, yes.

**Speaker 2:**
And maintain a consistent speed. Accelerate when needed, decelerate when needed, but not too abruptly. It depends on the road conditions. For example, slow down at intersections and when making turns. These are basic skills. And definitely, they shouldn't be making phone calls while driving.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else? No? Okay. What do you think is the biggest difference between experienced drivers and new drivers? How about their psychological qualities?

**Speaker 2:**
Some new drivers are hesitant and don't accelerate when they should, which can cause them to miss opportunities. Experienced drivers have more experience and can handle emergencies better. New drivers might not be familiar with the roads, like one-way streets or traffic signs. There's a saying that many people fail because they think they're experts. Experienced drivers might develop bad habits over time.

**Speaker 1:**
For example?

**Speaker 2:**
For example, they might think they're fine driving with one hand on the wheel. I've noticed many people do that, thinking they have full control. And that's about it. 

**Speaker 1:**
Alright. Now, let's talk about some issues related to autonomous driving. Just answer based on your own opinion. Do you think there are aspects where autonomous driving can never match human drivers?

**Speaker 2:**
Following instructions?

**Speaker 1:**
Following instructions?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, like at intersections when a traffic officer is directing traffic.

**Speaker 1:**
Following a traffic officer's directions.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because I recently saw a news report from the U.S. where an autonomous vehicle was directed by a traffic officer to turn right...
**Speaker 1:**
Let's talk about the traffic police's instructions.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because recently I saw news from the United States where an autonomous vehicle was instructed by a traffic officer to turn right, but it turned left instead. The vehicle was very rigid in its programming and couldn't understand human instructions. How can it follow a traffic officer's directions? It can't. This could make people feel unsafe, right?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, it can make passengers feel unsafe.

**Speaker 2:**
The first time I experienced it, I was a bit nervous because I was in the passenger seat. I thought it was okay since the trip was short. But when I saw the steering wheel moving on its own, I was quite scared. As a Chinese person, I believe that humans should control machines for safety. Also, I like to chat with the driver when I'm in a car, but with autonomous driving, it feels very mechanical and inflexible. For example, if I set a destination, I worry that I can't change it on the fly like I could with a human driver. And the cost is quite high.

**Speaker 1:**
Oh, it's quite expensive now?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was 30 yuan for 5 kilometers. It felt quite expensive.

**Speaker 1:**
Okay, do you think the car we just rode in was driven by a human or was it autonomous?

**Speaker 2:**
It felt like it was driven by a human. Why? Because there was someone sitting there, and I felt like they were controlling the steering wheel.

**Speaker 1:**
So, if we assume the car you just rode in was autonomous and the person sitting there was just a safety officer not actually driving, would that make you feel different?

**Speaker 2:**
No, it wouldn't make a difference to me. I've ridden in autonomous vehicles before, and they feel the same as human-driven ones. The speed control and reactions, like stopping at red lights or making turns, are similar to a human driver. However, the vehicle follows pre-set routes, and if it encounters an unfamiliar road, it might not know what to do. It feels like the speed control is too precise. But whether it's true or not, it doesn't matter to me; there's no difference.

**Speaker 1:**
Okay, one last question. This isn't directly related to today's experiment, but if you were a pedestrian crossing an intersection without traffic lights, how would you judge the intentions of cars or non-motorized vehicles?

**Speaker 2:**
By their turn signals. I look at whether they are turning left or right. Turn signals, anything else?

**Speaker 1:**
For example, if they are turning left or...

**Speaker 2:**
Right, I would judge based on that.
**Speaker 1:** Is it a right turn? The turn signal, is it on?

**Speaker 2:** For example, if they are turning left or...

**Speaker 1:** Right turn. I usually judge by looking at the car's wheels. Sometimes, by observing the wheels, I can tell if the car is going straight or stopping. If I'm unsure, I stop and wait for the car to make a move, then I can decide.

**Speaker 1:** You should stop first, yes.

**Speaker 2:** When I'm riding a bicycle and I encounter a car, I wait to see if it's turning left or right. Once it moves, I can tell.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, wait for it to move and see which direction it goes.

**Speaker 2:** If it doesn't move, I proceed. If it does, I wait. For instance, if the car is about to start, it will make a starting motion. If it stops, I can feel it. So, I rely on both the lights and my intuition.

**Speaker 1:** You rely on the lights and your intuition. In such situations, do you prefer to wait for all cars to pass before crossing, or do you rush forward?

**Speaker 2:** I definitely make sure it's clear first. I value my life.

**Speaker 1:** So, you only cross when there are no cars or when you are sure it's safe.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I usually wait for the green light. I rarely run red lights. I only go when I'm sure there are no cars.

**Speaker 1:** I've asked all the questions I had. Do you have any final thoughts on the driver? Any positive feedback?

**Speaker 2:** I think I've covered everything. I liked the driver's consistent speed. However, sometimes it can be frustrating when there's no traffic and the driver doesn't speed up. But today, I didn't feel rushed.

**Speaker 1:** Were you in a hurry today?

**Speaker 2:** No, not today. But usually, when I'm in a hurry, I prefer the driver to speed up if the road is clear. It can be annoying if they don't. But overall, it was comfortable. I almost felt like sleeping. The driver was very cautious and attentive to safety.

**Speaker 1:** That concludes our interview. Thank you.
Speaker 1: The driver seemed to be very safety-conscious. He was quite cautious, like I mentioned earlier, very careful and meticulous.

Speaker 2: Yes, our interview is coming to an end. Thank you for your participation. I'll recreate the link for you.

Speaker 1: Thank you for inviting me to this experiment.

Speaker 2: You're welcome, Wang Feng.
