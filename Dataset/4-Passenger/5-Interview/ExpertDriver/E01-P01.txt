**Speaker 1:**
First, I want to ask a few questions about your driving habits. You often travel by car, right? When you usually drive your private car, how long do you typically drive each time? 30 days? 33 days? How did you feel about this test drive?

**Speaker 2:**
I think the headrest was quite comfortable. My head and legs felt supported, but I think the seat could be improved.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel overall?

**Speaker 2:**
Overall, it was good. The car's acceleration and deceleration were smooth. If you had to choose, what type of car would you prefer for your travels? A gasoline car, an electric car, or an off-road vehicle?

**Speaker 1:**
I think I prefer electric cars. They offer a different experience compared to gasoline cars.

**Speaker 2:**
For example, during acceleration, some drivers might use a technique that makes the car feel smoother. Do you notice a difference?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, gasoline cars tend to have more noticeable movements during start and stop. It can feel a bit jerky. Do you drive yourself?

**Speaker 2:**
I have a driver's license, but I don't drive often. How do you feel about your driving skills?

**Speaker 1:**
I’m not very confident. Why do you lack confidence? Are you worried about certain situations on the road?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I worry about handling unexpected situations, like merging traffic or coordinating my feet on the pedals. Are there any specific road conditions that concern you?

**Speaker 1:**
I get nervous when there are too many cars. I’m also hesitant to make sudden movements. Let's watch the driving footage and discuss it. I need to get the mouse first.

**Speaker 1:**
How was the car's acceleration?

**Speaker 1:**
There was a slight jolt during acceleration. How did you feel during the turns?

**Speaker 1:**
What did you think about the electric bike we just saw? Did anything stand out to you? How about the wrong-way cyclist? How did that make you feel?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't feel much. I usually look out the window and enjoy the scenery. But when I see cyclists or electric bikes coming too close to our car, I get a bit anxious.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you think the driver handled it?

**Speaker 2:**
I think the driver was calm and composed. Were you worried during the initial part of the drive on the side road?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, a bit.
**Speaker 1:** How do you think the driver handled the situation? Did you feel safe? It seemed like he was driving in a calm and serious manner. For instance, when we first started on that side road, you might have been a bit worried because there were people around. Did you have any particular feelings about that? The acceleration was smooth, and there weren't any other vehicles around. Did you find it comfortable?

**Speaker 2:** In situations like this, for example, when a delivery vehicle blocks the lane, we have to move into the oncoming lane to pass. Did you feel worried about oncoming traffic and the possibility of a collision? It mainly depends on the driver's judgment, right?

**Speaker 1:** Overall, did you find the driver's handling of the situation comfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, but there was a moment when the driver made a sharp turn. Did you feel that the turn was too abrupt?

**Speaker 1:** Do you think the turn was sharp enough to make you want to grab the handle? Or did you still feel safe?

**Speaker 2:** It looked fine to me.

**Speaker 1:** So, you didn't feel the need to grab the handle, but did the sharp turn make you feel unsafe at any point?

**Speaker 2:** No, I felt the driver was driving safely. The sharp turn didn't make me feel unsafe.

**Speaker 1:** So, you think the driver handled the situation well. When we were heading back, a bicycle suddenly appeared. Did you notice it? How did you feel at that moment? There was also a large vehicle next to us. Did you feel tense because the driver didn't seem to change lanes? Why didn't you feel nervous?

**Speaker 2:** I judged the situation based on the road conditions and felt it was manageable.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think the driver's actions were somewhat risky, like taking up too much road space?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it felt a bit dangerous.

**Speaker 1:** Excuse me, can you hear me clearly?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I can hear you. You can continue recording.
