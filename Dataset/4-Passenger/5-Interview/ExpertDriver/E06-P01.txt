**Speaker 1:**
You can't see my computer now, haha. Yes, yes, just look at this place. So, let's start with some general questions. Do you often travel by car?

**Speaker 2:**
Not often.

**Speaker 1:**
Is it usually short trips or longer ones?

**Speaker 2:**
Mostly short trips, within Beijing.

**Speaker 1:**
Okay, how long do these trips usually take?

**Speaker 2:**
More than half an hour, sometimes an hour.

**Speaker 1:**
If you had to choose, what type of car would you prefer for your trips?

**Speaker 2:**
SUVs, off-road vehicles, or electric cars.

**Speaker 1:**
Which one do you prefer the most?

**Speaker 2:**
I usually prefer electric cars because I don't get car sick in them.

**Speaker 1:**
How did you feel about the car you rode in this time?

**Speaker 2:**
It was pretty good, but the seatbelt felt a bit tight. I was in a hurry and didn't adjust it properly.

**Speaker 1:**
Okay, how do you feel about the driver's skills?

**Speaker 2:**
Pretty good, very steady.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you drive yourself?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I don't have a driver's license.

**Speaker 1:**
If you did drive, how do you think you would do?

**Speaker 2:**
I'm not very confident in my driving skills, which is why I haven't learned to drive. I'm a bit scared because when I was younger, a relative of mine had an accident on an electric scooter, and it made me fearful. Also, my eyesight isn't great, which adds to my hesitation.

**Speaker 1:**
I see. Now, let's watch this video. If you notice anything during the trip, like the handle you mentioned earlier, let me know. Also, feel free to share any other thoughts or feelings you have about the route.

**Speaker 2:**
Sure.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you feel about this turn?

**Speaker 2:**
After 150 meters, turn left to enter the main road.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you feel about this road?

**Speaker 2:**
It's quite sunny, haha.

**Speaker 1:**
After 300 meters, we will reach the next point.

**Speaker 2:**
Okay, I don't have any specific comments about this part. Everything seems fine.

**Speaker 1:**
We are about to reach the next point, and then we will make a U-turn at the traffic light.
**Speaker 1:** So, how do you feel about this place? Is there anything specific you want to mention?

**Speaker 2:** We are approaching the waypoint. After the traffic light, we will make a U-turn to get back on the main road.

**Speaker 1:** How do you feel about this route?

**Speaker 2:** In about 300 meters, we will reach the waypoint.

**Speaker 1:** When the car moves forward from behind, it feels great. Is this the end of the route?

**Speaker 2:** We are about to reach the waypoint. After that, we will turn right.

**Speaker 1:** Why do I hear these five sounds, and then nothing else? But I don't feel any discomfort.

**Speaker 2:** No, there shouldn't be any discomfort.

**Speaker 1:** When the driver accelerates on this straight section, what is happening? I feel a bit scared. Is it because of today's acceleration?

**Speaker 2:** We are approaching the waypoint.

**Speaker 1:** At the traffic light, please turn right and slow down. Why is that?

**Speaker 2:** I am not sure why we are approaching the waypoint so quickly.

**Speaker 1:** When we turn right at the traffic light, I know there won't be much space, but I feel a bit uneasy. It's not a safety issue, just a physiological reaction. I know it should be fine.

**Speaker 2:** After turning right, we will enter Zhongguancun North Second Bridge. In 400 meters, we will reach the waypoint.

**Speaker 1:** When you came over, were there any significant discounts?

**Speaker 2:** We are about to reach the waypoint. At the end of the road, we will turn left.

**Speaker 2:** We are approaching the waypoint. At the end of the road, we will turn left.

**Speaker 1:** How do you feel after eating? Is everything okay?

**Speaker 2:** We are approaching the waypoint. After that, we will turn left.

**Speaker 1:** That's fine. How do you feel when you eat something strange?

**Speaker 2:** In 400 meters, we will reach the waypoint. There is a traffic camera 100 meters ahead.

**Speaker 1:** Are there any sudden bicycle intrusions?

**Speaker 1:** Have you noticed any dangerous maneuvers by the driver?

**Speaker 1:** We are about to reach the waypoint. After that, we will turn right. How do you feel about this experiment?

**Speaker 2:** We will safely reach the waypoint. After that, we will turn right.

**Speaker 1:** Just speak your mind. Say whatever comes to you.

**Speaker 2:** Turn right into Zhongguancun North Second Street.

**Speaker 1:** Okay, in 150 meters, turn right at the traffic light. Be aware of any sudden intrusions. Please use the right lane.

**Speaker 2:** We are about to turn right at the traffic light. We will soon reach the waypoint.

**Speaker 1:** When you usually ride in someone else's car, how does the driver behave? Do they drive too fast or are they more considerate?

**Speaker 2:** In 300 meters, we will reach the waypoint.

**Speaker 1:** How do you define safety in this context?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, we are about to reach the waypoint. After that, we will turn right.

**Speaker 1:** No, I can't handle this way of driving.

**Speaker 2:** After reaching the waypoint, we will turn right.

**Speaker 1:** That's better. New technology is...
**Speaker 1:**
Right, we are about to reach the intersection, then turn right.

**Speaker 2:**
No, I can't. I don't think I can do it.

**Speaker 1:**
After reaching the intersection, turn right.

**Speaker 2:**
That's better. The new technology is quite good.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, we are about to reach the intersection, then turn right.

**Speaker 2:**
When we get there, I can explain more. We haven't arrived yet.

**Speaker 1:**
Near the intersection, then...

**Speaker 1:**
Turn right into Zhongguancun North Street. After 400 meters, there is a traffic camera 200 meters ahead.

**Speaker 2:**
What about the driver? Some operations make them feel uncomfortable. Actually, there is a difference in how families communicate. Anyway, I know it's safe. So, I just pressed it. How do you think driving can be more comfortable for you? After arriving, turn left.

**Speaker 1:**
Near the intersection, then turn left.

**Speaker 2:**
Like sudden braking and starting, or suddenly speeding up during the journey.

**Speaker 1:**
Successfully reached the intersection.

**Speaker 2:**
I know driving slowly is for safety. But if you don't come out, you brake. Sometimes the driver feels the time is about to...

**Speaker 1:**
Driving classic.

**Speaker 2:**
I haven't encountered it. There's also a short video, haha, because the video is quite short.

**Speaker 1:**
After reaching the intersection, go straight. After 150 meters, you will reach the scenic spot.

**Speaker 2:**
When you usually take a car, do other drivers make you feel uncomfortable? Generally, when I take a car, the driver will shake the car.

**Speaker 1:**
About to reach the intersection, turn right.

**Speaker 2:**
Sometimes when they are in a hurry, they drive too fast. I usually recommend telling them to be safe.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think makes a driver professional enough? Or at least, what should they understand? For example, this... Yes, yes. Speed up. Let me check this place, right? Yes, because there is no one ahead. You see, there is no one in front, so he can speed up. I think the speed is a bit fast, but I feel it's safe because there are no vehicles ahead, and the place is quite open. So, he sped up.

**Speaker 2:**
Let me note the time first.

**Speaker 1:**
Any other feelings? Just feeling fast, and a bit...

**Speaker 2:**
The far left side.

**Speaker 1:**
It's this kind of feeling. Green and white lights. Because it's very sudden, and there is no reason. Maybe there was no food ahead. Or he is very skilled, and you trust his judgment, right? Yes, so there are no safety concerns.

**Speaker 2:**
What is your definition of comfort? In terms of ride comfort. Not a car, but a soft seat. Do you feel there are other aspects? When taking a taxi, I usually get car sick. Why didn't you get car sick this time? I guess it was slower.
**Speaker 1:** Do you feel there are other aspects to consider? For example, when you take a taxi, do you often get car sick?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I usually get car sick when I take a taxi. But this time, I didn't feel sick. I think it was because the driver was going slower. I was expecting to get car sick, but then I realized I wasn't, and I started wondering why.

**Speaker 1:** So, you had a pretty good experience this time. Do you think the driver was experienced or a novice?

**Speaker 2:** I think he was experienced. I asked him, and he said he's been driving here for 14 years. That made me feel he was very steady. My brother has also been driving for over ten years, and he's very steady too. You can tell when someone is experienced; they know when to stop and go without hesitation.

**Speaker 1:** What do you think is the main difference between an experienced driver and a novice?

**Speaker 2:** I'm not entirely sure, but if you were driving, you might be more distracted and less confident, especially with unfamiliar car models. Experienced drivers are more composed and make smoother decisions.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think autonomous cars can match human drivers in terms of handling unexpected situations?

**Speaker 2:** Autonomous cars can't chat with you or handle sudden events as well as humans can. They follow programmed routes and rules, but they might not adapt as quickly to unexpected situations.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think the technology of autonomous driving is as good as human driving?

**Speaker 2:** I can't say for sure. If there's someone chatting in the car, it depends on my mood. Sometimes I like to chat, but other times I prefer silence, especially when I'm tired.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think our recent trip was driven by a human or an autonomous system?

**Speaker 2:** It's hard to tell. If it was autonomous, it would have been consistent. But if it was a human, there would be more variability in speed and reactions to the environment. An autonomous system might not respond to a passenger's urgency, while a human driver might speed up if needed.

**Speaker 1:** So, do you think our trip was driven by a human or an autonomous system?

**Speaker 2:** Based on the smoothness and the way the car responded to the surroundings, I think it was a human driver. An autonomous system would have been more rigid and less adaptive to sudden changes.
**Speaker 1:** Based on the passenger's needs, because if the passenger is on a heavy vacation trip, they might not know what decisions to make. So, do you think this time it's a person driving or an autonomous vehicle with someone sitting next to it? What do you think it should be? It's unforgettable. Hmm, I don't know if it's autonomous driving; I don't have the freedom. It's okay, just your first subjective feeling, what is it? What does your intuition say? The problem is the driver, a human driver. OK, is there any reason? Can you imagine any details that make you think it might be a person? Is it simply because there's a person in the car, so you think it's a human? First of all, there's definitely a person in the car. Hmm. Suddenly, it accelerated, and I think that definitely indicates a human because it wouldn't. So, you think autonomous driving would be more consistent in speed. Do you think autonomous driving would do something in a manual way? Does it feel good outside? I won't give it to him. I know Beijing seems to use autonomous driving quite often, but I have already driven.

**Speaker 2:** So, wouldn't you feel unsafe if you were in a fully autonomous vehicle? That's my concern, but humans aren't always safe either. Hmm, humans can get tired while driving, but autonomous driving might not. Right. So, what is your definition of intelligence in this context? In terms of the intelligence of autonomous driving.

**Speaker 1:** Intelligence is just based on fundamentals, without human emotions. Hmm, a driver might be influenced by their mood, emotions. Yes, and whether they are rested or not. I think it still matters. Hmm, it still does. So, if our car was autonomous driving with a safety officer, would your experience be different from previous rides? It might feel safer, a double layer of protection. Hahaha, both a person and autonomous driving, right? Very safe. So, you think autonomous driving is quite safe as long as there are no technical issues. Yes. Yes, I think that's the trend. Were there any moments during the ride when you felt it might not be a human driving? I couldn't tell; it felt like a human. Yes, first of all, I haven't ridden in a fully autonomous car, so I can't define it. Hmm, and I always have the feeling of taking a taxi.

**Speaker 2:** Let me ask you, as a pedestrian, when you are crossing an intersection without traffic lights, how do you judge the intentions of nearby motor vehicles and non-motor vehicles? Their paths, for example, whether they will continue forward or stop. Lights? Yes, if the light is on this side, I know they will turn this way, right? Yes, and if I am turning, I will look back to see if there is any vehicle. If I am... As a pedestrian. Yes, as a pedestrian, if I am turning, I will...
**Speaker 1:** When making a turn, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, and if I need to turn, I will look back to see if there are any pedestrians. As a pedestrian, I would check all directions before turning.

**Speaker 1:** How do you determine if the car will stop for you or just pass through?

**Speaker 2:** By observing the car's speed.

**Speaker 1:** Can you explain that in more detail?

**Speaker 2:** If the car is about to turn, it will likely slow down. If it stops, the speed will drop significantly, almost to a halt.

**Speaker 1:** So, do you usually decide to cross regardless of the car's movement, or do you wait until it completely passes, or do you observe and proceed cautiously?

**Speaker 2:** I usually stop completely.

**Speaker 1:** You stop completely?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I wait until the car has fully passed.

**Speaker 1:** Even if you are in a hurry, do you still follow this approach?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I do.

**Speaker 1:** Well, that concludes our interview for today. Do you have any other questions?

**Speaker 2:** I understand that this interview is for future use in automated driving systems, right?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, that's correct. We mainly want to understand your experience and feelings about it.
