**Speaker 1:**
We might record this interview, but rest assured, everything will be kept confidential. Here is a microphone; you can clip it to your collar.

**Speaker 1:**
First, can I ask you a few questions about your usual travel habits? Do you often travel by car?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, quite often, but I usually don't drive myself.

**Speaker 1:**
You often take the subway, so when you take a car, it's usually for longer trips?

**Speaker 2:**
Usually, it's for shorter trips.

**Speaker 1:**
How long do these trips typically last? About half an hour? How did you feel about the ride in our vehicle today?

**Speaker 2:**
It felt great. The driver was very steady.

**Speaker 1:**
Steady, right. If you could choose, what type of car would you prefer for your travels?

**Speaker 2:**
If I could choose...

**Speaker 1:**
You can consider both the type of vehicle and the fuel it uses, like an SUV or a gasoline car, or an electric car.

**Speaker 2:**
A gasoline car.

**Speaker 1:**
Why do you prefer gasoline cars?

**Speaker 2:**
Because I...

**Speaker 1:**
You have a gasoline car in your daily life and haven't had much experience with electric cars, right? Do you drive yourself?

**Speaker 2:**
I'm still learning. I haven't gotten my license yet.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, now I'll play the video from our recent drive. You can watch it on the big screen.

**Speaker 1:**
During the video, if you notice any moments where your experience changes, please let me know. I might also pause occasionally to ask about your feelings at certain points. Can you see clearly?

**Speaker 2:**
It's a bit bright.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think the driver accelerated quickly?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really.

**Speaker 1:**
How about when the driver made those turns?

**Speaker 2:**
Very steady.

**Speaker 1:**
Is it a bit hard to see?

**Speaker 1:**
Hold on, I'll close the curtains. Is that better?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's better.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, let's continue. How did you feel on this side road? It seems a bit congested ahead.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was a bit congested, and when the driver stopped, it felt sudden. But overall, it felt very safe.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you think the driver handled the nearby vehicles, like that tricycle going the wrong way?

**Speaker 2:**
I didn't pay much attention to the other vehicles, but the driver kept a safe distance.

**Speaker 1:**
Which areas do you usually focus on? The left side? The right side?

**Speaker 2:**
I usually focus on...
Speaker 1: Do you generally keep a safe distance while driving?

Speaker 2: Yes, I always maintain a safe distance.

Speaker 1: Which areas do you usually focus on? The left side? The right side?

Speaker 2: I usually focus on the front.

Speaker 1: So, you don't turn your head to look around?

Speaker 2: I do look around, but when I turn my head, it's often to look at the scenery or buildings, not necessarily the cars beside me.

Speaker 1: You enjoy the scenery. Right.

Speaker 2: Yes, I do.

Speaker 1: Did you notice the driver accelerating in this area?

Speaker 2: In this section? Yes, I did notice it, especially when we got to the bridge.

Speaker 1: Did you feel the acceleration was smooth?

Speaker 2: Yes, it was quite smooth.

Speaker 1: Now, we're waiting to make a U-turn. What stage are you at with your driving license?

Speaker 2: I've completed the second stage.

Speaker 1: Are you practicing for the third stage now? Do you think driving on the road will be more challenging?

Speaker 2: I think it will be a bit more difficult.

Speaker 1: How did you feel about the U-turn?

Speaker 2: Well, I thought the driver would just turn directly, but he let other cars pass first.

Speaker 1: Did you feel unsafe when he had to reverse a bit to make the turn?

Speaker 2: No, I didn't feel unsafe.

Speaker 1: How did you feel about this section of the drive?

Speaker 2: It felt like we were moving at a constant speed.

Speaker 1: Did you ever find your attention wandering during the drive?

Speaker 2: Not much. I was mostly focused on the surroundings.

Speaker 1: Did you observe the driver at all?

Speaker 2: Not really, but occasionally I glanced at him. He seemed very experienced and familiar with the route, which made him appear relaxed.

Speaker 1: From the camera footage, does the speed seem faster than it felt inside the car?

Speaker 2: Yes, it does seem faster on camera.

Speaker 1: Did you notice any unsafe driving maneuvers?

Speaker 2: No, I didn't notice any.

Speaker 1: Have you ever felt unsafe while riding in someone else's car?

Speaker 2: Yes, sometimes. For example, when a car suddenly appears in front and the driver has to brake abruptly.
**Speaker 1:** Have you ever felt unsafe while driving?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, there have been times. For example, when a car suddenly appears in front of you, and the driver might not have noticed it before. They have to brake suddenly.

**Speaker 1:** So, you worry about collisions, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:** What do you think makes driving safer?

**Speaker 2:** Definitely following traffic rules and not speeding.

**Speaker 1:** So, obeying traffic rules and not speeding.

**Speaker 2:** Especially on roads where you need to be observant of both sides.

**Speaker 1:** Do you feel that today's driver is paying attention to these things?

**Speaker 2:** I think he is quite attentive. There was a situation where a bicycle suddenly appeared.

**Speaker 1:** A bicycle suddenly appeared, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it happened when we were making a U-turn. The cyclist came from the front, and the driver had to yield to six people. He was very courteous.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think being courteous is important while driving?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it's very important.

**Speaker 1:** Were you worried when the driver changed lanes, especially when another car was approaching?

**Speaker 2:** No, I wasn't worried. I didn't even check the side mirrors or the rearview mirror.

**Speaker 1:** So, you didn't check the mirrors at all?

**Speaker 2:** No, I didn't. I trusted the driver completely.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel comfortable with the driver's skills today?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, very comfortable.

**Speaker 1:** In what ways?

**Speaker 2:** Firstly, he maintained a good speed. Even when he accelerated, it wasn't too fast. It was appropriate.

**Speaker 1:** Was the acceleration smooth? Did it push you forward?

**Speaker 2:** No, not at all. It was very smooth.

**Speaker 1:** How about the braking?

**Speaker 2:** The braking was also smooth. It didn't cause any sudden jolts.

**Speaker 1:** So, the car stopped naturally?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, very naturally. He anticipated stops well in advance.

**Speaker 1:** Do you feel that the driver was considerate of your comfort?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, he maintained a very steady speed throughout.

**Speaker 1:** Have you ever felt uncomfortable in other people's cars?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, definitely. Sometimes they drive too fast.

**Speaker 1:** Too fast, and?

**Speaker 2:** And they don't pay attention to the surroundings.
**Speaker 1:**
Were there any moments that made you feel uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, definitely. It was when the car was going very fast.

**Speaker 1:**
Very fast, and then?

**Speaker 2:**
What was it? Was it you turning left and right? It was when the car was swaying and stopping, and then moving forward again.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel nervous at that time?

**Speaker 2:**
I felt extremely nervous. By the way, how did you drive?

**Speaker 1:**
I encountered this kind of situation when taking a taxi.

**Speaker 2:**
It rarely happens in a taxi, more often in a friend's or family member's car.

**Speaker 1:**
Would you point it out directly?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I would.

**Speaker 1:**
So, do you think driving slowly is better than driving fast?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I think so. For me, at least.

**Speaker 1:**
Would you worry about not reaching the destination on time?

**Speaker 2:**
In such cases, it really depends on the situation. If it's urgent, then maybe driving faster is necessary.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you hope to drive faster in urgent situations, but generally, you prefer driving slowly. Right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, not extremely slow, just at a normal pace. Today, for example, was just right.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you feel about the distance he keeps from other cars?

**Speaker 2:**
He maintains a good distance. He always keeps a safe distance and slows down when necessary. He constantly observes the car in front and doesn't get too close. It's very appropriate.

**Speaker 1:**
How does he handle cyclists?

**Speaker 2:**
His awareness is about the same.

**Speaker 1:**
About the same. How far do you think is a safe distance? Do you have a rough estimate?

**Speaker 2:**
From the passenger seat, it looks like about two to three meters.

**Speaker 1:**
Around two meters or a bit more.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, a bit over two meters.

**Speaker 1:**
There might be a bit more to this. What do you think makes a good driver?

**Speaker 2:**
First, the driver's skill and proficiency. They should be familiar with the rules and the environment. They need to follow the rules, like yielding to turning vehicles. They should drive consistently and not just however they want. Complaints should be avoided.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
They should pay attention to pedestrians and be ready to react to them at any time. Also, it's best not to smoke in the car, as it can make the experience unpleasant.

**Speaker 1:**
If you were driving, how would you handle it?

**Speaker 2:**
If I were driving...
**Speaker 1:**
Do you think if you were driving, how would you handle it?

**Speaker 2:**
If I were driving, I would definitely include those few things we mentioned earlier. Also, I might play some music because it's too quiet, haha.

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, today we couldn't play music because of the experiment, but if you were driving yourself in the future...

**Speaker 2:**
I would definitely play some music to make the drive more enjoyable.

**Speaker 1:**
Did you feel any bumps during the drive? For example, when going over a manhole cover or something like that.

**Speaker 2:**
Not particularly.

**Speaker 1:**
That's normal. So, have you heard about autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:**
Autonomous driving?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, it's when the car drives itself.

**Speaker 2:**
Oh, how do you know about it?

**Speaker 1:**
I haven't really looked into it. What aspects do you think autonomous cars can't do as well as humans, based on what you know?

**Speaker 2:**
Probably the speed control.

**Speaker 1:**
Speed control?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, machines might have a fixed speed, but humans can adjust it more flexibly.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
Not really.

**Speaker 1:**
So, do you think the recent drive was done by a human or a machine?

**Speaker 2:**
I think it was a human.

**Speaker 1:**
Why do you think so?

**Speaker 2:**
Because there was a person sitting next to me.

**Speaker 1:**
But what if that person was just a safety officer pretending to drive? How would that change your experience compared to your usual driving experience?

**Speaker 2:**
Wow, that would be incredibly comfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
Haha, so you think it was better than your usual experience? What details made you think it might have been a machine driving?

**Speaker 2:**
It felt like a machine when it was reversing and then moving forward again. The way it switched gears felt automated.

**Speaker 1:**
Besides those actions, did the speed, distance between cars, and smoothness make you think it was a machine?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because from my experience learning to drive, starting and stopping usually have some bumps, but this was completely smooth.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you think the starting and stopping were too smooth to be normal?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was so smooth that it felt unnatural.

**Speaker 1:**
Anything else?

**Speaker 2:**
I can't think of anything else.

**Speaker 1:**
That's okay. One more question: as a pedestrian, when you cross an intersection without traffic lights, how do you judge the drivers' intentions?
**Speaker 1:** There's another question. When you're a pedestrian and you're crossing an intersection without traffic lights, how do you judge the drivers' intentions?

**Speaker 2:** I look to see if there are no lights.

**Speaker 1:** Right, no traffic lights.

**Speaker 2:** Some cars, you can tell they have no intention of slowing down, so you feel like they might just drive through. But with some cars, you can see their headlights, and you can tell they might slow down or stop. And if they have their turn signals on, you know they might be turning.

**Speaker 1:** In such situations, how do you decide to cross?

**Speaker 2:** If it's a car that's speeding up, I definitely won't cross. I'll wait. If I see a few cars preparing to stop, then I'll cross.

**Speaker 1:** In this traffic flow, do you wait until all the cars have passed, or do you move slowly across?

**Speaker 2:** In my case, I usually move slowly across.

**Speaker 1:** Okay, that's all our questions. Thank you very much for participating in our experiment today.

**Speaker 2:** Sure, thank you.
