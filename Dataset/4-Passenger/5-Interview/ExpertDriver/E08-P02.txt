**Speaker 1:**
Alright, shall we start now? Are you ready? Great. Do you often travel by car?

**Speaker 2:**
Not much recently.

**Speaker 1:**
Not much recently. When you do travel, is it usually long-distance or short-distance?

**Speaker 2:**
Mostly short-distance.

**Speaker 1:**
How long are these short trips usually?

**Speaker 2:**
About an hour or half an hour.

**Speaker 1:**
Around an hour and a half. What kind of vehicles do you usually take?

**Speaker 2:**
Buses or ride-hailing services.

**Speaker 1:**
How do you feel about the vehicle you took this time?

**Speaker 2:**
It feels alright, haha.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, can you be more specific about what you liked and didn't like?

**Speaker 2:**
It feels solid and stable. The seats are quite soft and comfortable, and the car is pretty quiet inside.

**Speaker 1:**
And what do you think about the driver's skills?

**Speaker 2:**
The driver is okay, but there was a moment when he seemed a bit distracted, haha.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you describe when he was distracted?

**Speaker 2:**
There was a moment when we were near the roadside, and he seemed to be distracted by the navigation. He almost drove into a tree on the roadside but managed to stop just in time.

**Speaker 1:**
So there was some sudden braking?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it was quite sudden. He realized it immediately and braked quickly.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you remember where this happened? Could you identify the location if you saw a video?

**Speaker 2:**
I might be able to with a video, but I'm not good with locations, so I can't remember exactly where it was.

**Speaker 1:**
Did this incident make you feel uncomfortable or unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**
No, it didn't. I think it's just a normal part of driving; sometimes small mistakes happen.

**Speaker 1:**
If you had to choose, what type of car do you prefer for traveling? For example, an SUV, a gasoline car, an electric car, or a sedan?

**Speaker 2:**
In terms of comfort, I prefer a sedan.

**Speaker 1:**
Why do you find sedans more comfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
They have better insulation, which makes me feel more private and secure.
**Speaker 1:** How do you feel about the car's privacy?

**Speaker 2:** The car has good insulation, which means people outside can't see me. Overall, the space makes me feel private.

**Speaker 1:** You must value your privacy a lot.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I don't like being seen clearly by others all the time.

**Speaker 1:** Are there any other aspects that make this car comfortable for you?

**Speaker 2:** Overall, the car's interior features, including the seats, sound system, and air conditioning, are quite comfortable.

**Speaker 1:** Besides these features, is there anything else? Do you drive yourself?

**Speaker 2:** No, I don't drive.

**Speaker 1:** Have you ever learned to drive?

**Speaker 2:** No, I haven't.

**Speaker 1:** If you did learn to drive, how do you think your driving skills would be?

**Speaker 2:** I think if I learned, I could drive, but I might make some mistakes, like getting distracted and almost hitting something.

**Speaker 1:** Can you give an example of such a mistake?

**Speaker 2:** Like today, the driver got distracted and almost hit something. I might do something similar.

**Speaker 1:** Now, we will play a video of a recent drive. If you notice anything or have any feelings about it, please let me know. I will also ask you some questions. Let's continue. After the U-turn, turn left, then immediately right. How did you feel about that turn?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't notice much about that turn.

**Speaker 1:** What about the right turn at the end of the road?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't feel anything special about that either.

**Speaker 1:** When we reached the destination, how did you feel about the cars around?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't really notice the other cars.

**Speaker 1:** What about when small cars suddenly appeared from behind?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't pay much attention to that either.

**Speaker 1:** What do you usually focus on when you're in the car?

**Speaker 2:** I usually listen to the driver's navigation and watch them drive. I find the navigation system strange because it often says we're near a place without mentioning the road names, which confuses me.

**Speaker 1:** So, you didn't notice the car itself much, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, that's correct.
**Speaker 1:** So, you couldn't recognize the name of the street, right? What did you think the navigation was talking about?

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, I didn't really notice the car either. When I watched the video, I felt a bit overwhelmed. Sitting in the car, I didn't feel anything, but watching the video, I suddenly felt like everything on the road was so close to us. Haha.

**Speaker 1:** When you're in the car, you might not notice these things, especially since you were sitting in the back seat. Your view of the road ahead wasn't as clear.

**Speaker 2:** At that time, I was really focused on listening to the navigation. I kept guessing what place it was talking about. "Turn left at the north intersection to enter the main road."

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel when you had to make a U-turn at that place?

**Speaker 2:** It felt like a similar place, but it wasn't exactly the same. It was the second time we went there.

**Speaker 1:** This is actually the second video.

**Speaker 2:** Really? Maybe it was this place then. It was a similar spot where we almost drove up and nearly crashed.

**Speaker 1:** "Approaching the destination, then turn right."

**Speaker 1:** Was this during steady driving or accelerating straight?

**Speaker 2:** It seemed like it was during steady driving.

**Speaker 1:** Did the steady driving give you any particular feeling?

**Speaker 2:** Not really, it felt just like normal driving.

**Speaker 1:** Oh, something fell. Did you see it?

**Speaker 2:** No, I didn't see it.

**Speaker 1:** "Approaching the destination, then at the traffic light..."

**Speaker 2:** My view might have been obstructed. "Approaching the destination, then at the traffic light..."

**Speaker 1:** Turn right. How did you feel about the turn?

**Speaker 2:** It was a series of turns, quite a few of them.

**Speaker 1:** Yes, there were indeed many turns.

**Speaker 2:** We almost made a full circle.

**Speaker 1:** There were a lot of turns.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, almost a full circle, then we got back on the main road.

**Speaker 1:** Did you notice the pedestrians when you were turning?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I did.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel about the turn?

**Speaker 2:** It felt like there were many turns in that area.

**Speaker 1:** Wasn't it a straight road?

**Speaker 2:** No, it was in a residential area with many turns. After all the turns, we finally got back on the main road.

**Speaker 1:** "400 meters to the destination."

**Speaker 2:** "100 meters to the destination."
**Speaker 1:** After several turns, we finally got onto Chengfu Road, and then I saw we were driving straight.

**Speaker 2:** After 400 meters, we reached the store.

**Speaker 1:** At 100 meters, there was a violation. Hmm, were we still inside or had we come out?

**Speaker 2:** Hmm, yes, we hadn't reached the main road yet.

**Speaker 1:** Were you accelerating at this point?

**Speaker 2:** No, no, there was no acceleration.

**Speaker 1:** He didn't accelerate at all during the entire trip.

**Speaker 2:** He was just driving quite slowly.

**Speaker 1:** Quite steadily. Hmm, so there was no acceleration, right? Hmm, did you feel anything unusual near the scenic spot? Then you turned right. How did you feel about the pedestrians nearby?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't really notice the pedestrians at that time.

**Speaker 1:** OK. Did you notice the motorcycles? Please stay in the right lane. In 150 meters, turn right at the traffic light. Please stay in the right lane, turn right at the traffic light, and then you will immediately reach the store. How did you feel when passing through this intersection?

**Speaker 2:** This intersection?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, you see, the traffic conditions were quite complex, with many pedestrians crossing the road. How did you feel?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't feel particularly nervous. I just felt like we were driving further and further away.

**Speaker 1:** So, physically, you didn't feel any discomfort or anything?

**Speaker 2:** No discomfort, but I did feel that the route for the second trip was different from the first one.

**Speaker 1:** Isn't that so?

**Speaker 2:** I was thinking about something else.

**Speaker 1:** It's all the same.

**Speaker 2:** Really? Why did it feel different on the second trip, especially when turning right?

**Speaker 1:** The sense of the road is really something, haha. Turn right. In 150 meters, you will reach the destination.

**Speaker 2:** Classic. The first time, we were about to reach the destination, and the second time, I suddenly felt like I discovered a new route, then made a U-turn, and then...

**Speaker 1:** Came back. Hmm, near the destination, then turn right. How did you feel when the small car passed by? Nothing special? Turn right at the entrance to Zhongguancun North Street. In 400 meters, you will reach the store. At 100 meters, there was a violation captured by the camera.

**Speaker 1:** Did you notice the speed bumps?

**Speaker 2:** We were still inside the park we just left.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel when you went out?

**Speaker 2:** It just felt like a bump, something we encounter often.

**Speaker 1:** Did it make you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Not excessively, just a slight bump.

**Speaker 1:** But it still felt a bit uncomfortable, right?

**Speaker 2:** A little bit. Not very serious.

**Speaker 1:** But you didn't mind it, right? It felt normal.

**Speaker 2:** Yes. In 100 meters, you will reach the store. You are about to reach the destination. Pass through the current traffic light. In 150 meters, you will reach the destination. You are about to reach the destination, then turn right at the end of the road.
**Speaker 1:** We are approaching the waypoint, and soon we will reach the destination. We are near the waypoint. Proceed through the current traffic light. In 150 meters, we will reach the destination. After that, turn right at the end of the road to reach the nearby point. In 100 meters, turn right at the end of the road to enter the main road. Keep driving on the main road, and then make a U-turn in 400 meters. Your friend is on the phone, so please use the leftmost lane. In 250 meters, make a U-turn at the traffic light. Use the leftmost lane and make a U-turn at the traffic light. How did you feel when passing this entrance?

**Speaker 2:** At this entrance, I felt a bit anxious, especially during rush hour. I was a bit concerned about traffic safety, but not too worried since everyone was following the rules. It felt a bit more tense than in less crowded areas.

**Speaker 1:** What did the driver do in this situation? How did it make you feel?

**Speaker 2:** The driver was just waiting at the red light. Nothing special, really. I felt he was driving quite normally.

**Speaker 1:** Haha, he follows traffic rules well, right? Do pedestrians follow traffic rules too?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, pedestrians also follow traffic rules quite well.

**Speaker 1:** So, you trust the driver.

**Speaker 1:** In 200 meters, turn right. Did you notice any dangerous maneuvers by the driver during this process?

**Speaker 2:** The only dangerous thing might be when he seemed distracted.

**Speaker 1:** Was he really distracted, or did you just feel that way?

**Speaker 2:** I think he was distracted because normally he wouldn't suddenly get so tense and rush forward, then have to brake suddenly.

**Speaker 1:** How do you think driving can be made safer?

**Speaker 2:** To drive more safely, one must stay focused.

**Speaker 1:** Is that so?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, staying focused is crucial.

**Speaker 1:** Besides staying focused, are there other aspects?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, if there are more reminders. If the driver seems distracted, passengers should notice and remind him. Sometimes drivers get tired or suddenly think of something and lose focus. On the road, this can be dangerous, so it's important to remind them.

**Speaker 1:** Besides staying focused, are there other aspects?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, managing road conditions better, especially during peak traffic times, can help. Strengthening traffic management and guidance can reduce chaos.

**Speaker 1:** So, regarding the driver?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, regarding the driver, I think this particular driver follows traffic rules quite well.

**Speaker 1:** What about other drivers you usually ride with? How do you think they can drive more safely?
**Speaker 1:**
It seems that this driver is relatively good at following traffic rules.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, that's right.

**Speaker 1:**
If it wasn't this driver, but other drivers you usually ride with, how do you think they could drive more safely?

**Speaker 2:**
Some drivers drive quite recklessly. For instance, as soon as they reach areas without much surveillance, they start speeding and even driving against traffic. I am strongly against driving against traffic, especially on side roads. They should be driving on the right side, but some choose to drive on the left, which is very unsafe.

**Speaker 1:**
So, they don't follow the traffic rules. Do you feel there are any other unsafe aspects related to speed?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, especially at night. If you drive too fast, it can be very dangerous.

**Speaker 1:**
Can you think of any other aspects?

**Speaker 2:**
I think driving skills are also important. In emergency situations, a new driver might not know how to respond correctly, whereas an experienced driver might be able to avoid an accident with a quick turn of the steering wheel.

**Speaker 1:**
An experienced driver, right? Do you think today's driver is experienced or a new driver?

**Speaker 2:**
I think he is an experienced driver.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think is the biggest difference between a new driver and an experienced driver?

**Speaker 2:**
It's hard to say, but I imagine the way they handle unexpected situations is different. An experienced driver might be more composed and handle things more appropriately, while a new driver might panic, stop when they should accelerate, or move erratically, leading to accidents.

**Speaker 1:**
I see.

**Speaker 2:**
Another aspect is courage. Generally, new drivers are more cautious.

**Speaker 1:**
What situations can arise from being overly cautious?

**Speaker 2:**
Being overly cautious means new drivers tend to follow traffic rules more strictly and drive slower. However, sometimes they drive too slowly when they should be speeding up.

**Speaker 1:**
I understand.

**Speaker 2:**
They are indecisive, always hesitating.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you mean by indecisive? In what situations are they indecisive?

**Speaker 2:**
For example, when there are many cars and people, there might be a gap they can go through. An experienced driver would quickly accelerate and steer through, but a new driver might hesitate and miss the opportunity.

**Speaker 1:**
So, when passing through intersections, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly. They might not be able to judge the situation correctly and hesitate.
**Speaker 1:** So, right, right, right? Yes, it seems like he might be unsure about how to navigate the situation, and he himself is also uncertain.

**Speaker 2:** Exactly, he lacks confidence in himself and possibly in the road conditions as well. So, he hesitates to move unless the road is completely clear of cars and people, and there are no apparent dangers. In situations where a tricycle suddenly cuts in or a vehicle abruptly swerves, he might not react quickly enough, making a collision more likely.

**Speaker 1:** His emergency response skills are still lacking, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, his emergency response skills are quite poor.

**Speaker 1:** When you ride in someone else's car, are there any behaviors from the driver that make you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Uncomfortable? Well, I find it unpleasant when drivers smoke. Other than that, it's generally okay.

**Speaker 1:** Are there any behaviors that make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:** Feeling unsafe? Speeding, especially at night when there are fewer cars and less surveillance in our area. Without surveillance, some drivers speed excessively. Even if it doesn't necessarily lead to an accident, it feels unsafe psychologically.

**Speaker 1:** How do you define safety? What makes you feel safe?

**Speaker 2:** Safety, right? I think it means an environment with minimal risk factors. Also, it’s about feeling that the driver’s behavior is something you can mentally handle and accept.

**Speaker 1:** So, it’s about your trust in the driver?

**Speaker 2:** Not exactly trust. It’s more about the driver following normal driving practices. If they drive normally, I feel relatively confident that nothing unexpected will happen. However, if they drive too fast, break rules, or weave through traffic recklessly, it feels unsafe. Some drivers like to show off their skills or engage in road rage, which is very unsafe.

**Speaker 1:** How do you define comfort in a car?

**Speaker 2:** Comfort? It’s about the overall feeling of being in the car.

**Speaker 1:** Specifically, what aspects contribute to that feeling?

**Speaker 2:** The seat environment, the interaction with the driver, and the external environment.

**Speaker 1:** Do you prefer interacting with the driver or not?

**Speaker 2:** Well...
**Speaker 1:**
Can you tell me about your interaction with the truck driver and the environment outside the vehicle?

**Speaker 2:**
The driver doesn't engage in excessive interaction. Some drivers love to chat while driving, and it feels like their focus isn't on the road.

**Speaker 1:**
That makes you feel unsafe, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it feels unsafe. When the driver isn't fully focused, the safety level decreases.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you mean by the environment outside the vehicle?

**Speaker 2:**
I mean the road conditions. If the road is chaotic or stressful, it affects my comfort and can be a bit overwhelming.

**Speaker 1:**
It can have a physiological impact. Did the driver do anything today that made you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:**
No, except for one moment when we almost had a collision. That was a bit unsettling, but otherwise, no.

**Speaker 1:**
How can driving be made more comfortable for you?

**Speaker 2:**
Overall, if the driver maintains a smooth and steady pace, avoids sudden acceleration or braking, and handles the car well, it feels more comfortable. No unexpected incidents make the ride better.

**Speaker 1:**
No unexpected incidents, meaning no traffic accidents, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, no traffic accidents. Sometimes, like when we watched that video, a car suddenly coming towards you can be alarming.

**Speaker 1:**
A car coming towards you?

**Speaker 2:**
Or narrowly passing by. If I'm in the back seat, I might not notice, but if I'm in the front passenger seat and it happens often, it can be stressful.

**Speaker 1:**
So, being too close to other objects at high speed is stressful?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, especially at high speeds, narrowly missing other vehicles can be very stressful.

**Speaker 1:**
What qualities make a driver professional? What should they at least be able to do?

**Speaker 2:**
They should have good driving skills and a strong sense of following rules. The driver's mental state is also important; they shouldn't be overly nervous or easily agitated. They should avoid arguments and maintain a stable mood. It's best if they stay focused and don't get distracted while driving.

**Speaker 1:**
If a driver's emotional state is poor, does it affect your sense of safety during the ride?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, if a driver is visibly agitated, I worry they might engage in road rage or aggressive driving.

**Speaker 1:**
That would make you uncomfortable, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it would.
**Speaker 1:** If a driver is visibly very emotional, I would be worried that they might suddenly engage in road rage or aggressive driving.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, that would make me feel uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:** Does it create psychological pressure for you?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it does create some psychological pressure.

**Speaker 1:** So, it makes you feel somewhat anxious?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I feel a bit worried.

**Speaker 1:** But more importantly, it's a concern for safety, right?

**Speaker 2:** Exactly, it's mainly a safety concern. What do you mean by "technical proficiency"?

**Speaker 1:** It means the driver is very familiar with and knowledgeable about the car.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, they should be very familiar with the car and know how to handle it well.

**Speaker 1:** So, they should be very familiar with the car's condition and how to drive it.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, including how to operate it smoothly and efficiently. They should be able to handle the car like an expert, without any hesitation or awkwardness.

**Speaker 1:** They should be very skilled and comfortable with driving.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, their driving skills should be excellent, allowing them to control the vehicle very well.

**Speaker 1:** I understand. If the driver is not familiar with the car, would that make you concerned about safety or comfort?

**Speaker 2:** I would worry that in case of an emergency, they might not react appropriately or handle the situation well.

**Speaker 1:** So, it's about their reaction and handling of unexpected situations?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, their reaction time and the way they handle unexpected situations.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think the car was being driven manually or was it on autopilot today?

**Speaker 2:** I think it was driven manually. Why? Because overall, I can't really describe what autopilot feels like, but it generally felt like an experienced driver was behind the wheel.

**Speaker 1:** Except for that one collision.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, except for that collision.

**Speaker 1:** In what ways did it feel like an experienced driver was driving?

**Speaker 2:** For example, when approaching speed bumps, the driver slowed down smoothly instead of speeding over them, which made the ride more comfortable.

**Speaker 1:** So, you think autopilot can't achieve that level of smoothness?

**Speaker 2:** In my imagination, it can't. Haha.

**Speaker 1:** So, you feel that autopilot might not handle unexpected situations as well as a human driver?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I think in unexpected situations, like if a tricycle suddenly appears, autopilot might not handle it as well as a human driver.
**Speaker 1:** Have you encountered any unexpected situations while driving, like when a tricycle suddenly appears? How do you handle that? Sometimes, with autonomous driving, it might not react as quickly as a human would. For instance, if you take a wrong turn, autonomous driving relies heavily on navigation, following the set route. But humans can recognize the roads and might choose a more reasonable and flexible path they are familiar with.

**Speaker 2:** Are there any other aspects?

**Speaker 1:** No, that's it.

**Speaker 2:** So, if you were riding in a car with autonomous driving and the driver was just a safety officer, how was this experience different from your previous rides?

**Speaker 1:** I think autonomous driving has become very advanced. Honestly, it's beyond my imagination. I had never experienced autonomous driving before, and it feels almost like a human is driving the car.

**Speaker 2:** So, you still think that human drivers are much better than autonomous driving?

**Speaker 1:** Yes, I believe so. The road conditions are highly variable. In some situations, autonomous driving might seem a bit immature. I think humans, especially experienced drivers who follow the rules, handle unexpected situations more reasonably.

**Speaker 1:** Were there any moments during your ride when you felt that it wasn't a human driving but an autonomous system? Did you have such moments?

**Speaker 2:** No, not at all. There were no such moments.

**Speaker 1:** As a pedestrian, when you approach an intersection without traffic signals, how do you judge the intentions of the vehicles around you?

**Speaker 2:** I observe the cars. If they slow down, I think they are waiting for me. If they don't slow down and keep moving forward, I assume they won't wait, so I wait for them to pass.

**Speaker 1:** In such situations, do you wait for all the vehicles to pass before crossing, or do you just go ahead regardless of their actions?

**Speaker 2:** I usually wait for them to pass before I cross.
**Speaker 1:** In such a situation, would you choose to wait until all the cars have passed before you proceed, or would you just go ahead regardless of the cars, or would you take it step by step, observing the situation as you go?

**Speaker 2:** I would definitely observe first. If I see that the driver has already slowed down or stopped, then I would cross. If the driver doesn't slow down and ignores me, I would wait until they pass.

**Speaker 1:** So, you would choose to keep approaching gradually. What I mean is, if there are cars, would you choose to go ahead regardless, or would you keep getting closer and look for an opportunity to cross?

**Speaker 2:** I would stay by the roadside.

**Speaker 1:** You would wait until all the cars have passed before you proceed, right? You would wait until there are no cars.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I would wait to clearly see the situation. Sometimes drivers are very polite and stop, so I would go. If the driver doesn't stop and just goes, I would wait until they pass and then cross when there are no cars.

**Speaker 1:** So, you would look for an opportunity to cross, right? You would observe the driver, and if they stop completely, you would go.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:** What is your definition of intelligence in terms of autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:** Intelligence, right? I think it should be more like human capabilities.

**Speaker 1:** The ability to think.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it's not just mechanical. I feel like my understanding of artificial intelligence might be a bit outdated now.

**Speaker 1:** Not at all.

**Speaker 2:** My previous understanding was that it could handle routine and repetitive tasks smoothly and quickly if programmed like a human. But if I were to define intelligence, it should also be able to learn and handle unconventional situations based on human experience.

**Speaker 2:** It might not handle everything perfectly, but it should at least come up with one or two solutions and solve most problems without causing major issues or new problems. For example, in driving, it should at least avoid causing accidents. If it can do that, I would consider it quite intelligent.

**Speaker 1:** So, you think it should be able to handle situations flexibly.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, it should be able to do some things.

**Speaker 1:** It can mimic human behavior to some extent.

**Speaker 2:** Yes, if it can learn from human experience.
**Speaker 1:**
I think he should be able to handle some situations.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, he can mimic human behavior to some extent.

**Speaker 1:**
Exactly, if you teach him human experiences, he should be able to handle similar situations. But real-life scenarios can be very complex, and he might not always know how to react. For example, in very complicated road conditions, he might just stop and not know what to do, haha.

**Speaker 2:**
Ah, I see. So your understanding has changed now?

**Speaker 1:**
Yes, it has.

**Speaker 2:**
I believe if you teach him certain things, he should be able to learn and manage them.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright. That’s about it for today’s questions. Do you have any other questions or suggestions?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I don’t have any.

**Speaker 1:**
Okay, then we’ll end the recording here for today.
