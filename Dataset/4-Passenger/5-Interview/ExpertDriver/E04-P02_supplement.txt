**Speaker 1:**
Alright, let me start by asking you a question about your daily life. Do you often travel by car?

**Speaker 2:**
Not often. When I do, it's usually for longer trips rather than short ones.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you mean you mostly take long trips?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, when I say car, I mean a small sedan. For short trips, I usually take a taxi.

**Speaker 1:**
How long do these taxi rides usually last?

**Speaker 2:**
About 20 minutes, typically to the airport.

**Speaker 1:**
And for long trips, how long do they usually take?

**Speaker 2:**
For example, last weekend I went to the mountains. I drove 50 kilometers one way.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it. How did you feel about your experience with our vehicle this time?

**Speaker 2:**
I felt very comfortable.

**Speaker 1:**
Was the ride smooth?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, very smooth. The driverâ€™s skills were excellent.

**Speaker 1:**
In what ways?

**Speaker 2:**
The driver was calm and didn't rush. He drove slowly and steadily, which made the ride very smooth.

**Speaker 1:**
If you had to choose, what type of car do you prefer for your travels? For example, an SUV or an electric car?

**Speaker 2:**
I prefer new energy vehicles.

**Speaker 1:**
Why is that?

**Speaker 2:**
Because I like the sound they make. It's a soft electric hum, which I find quite peaceful.

**Speaker 1:**
Any other reasons?

**Speaker 2:**
They have a high-tech feel and are very clean.

**Speaker 1:**
Environmentally friendly, right? What aspects give you that high-tech feeling?

**Speaker 2:**
The unique sound they make.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it's mainly about the sound?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it feels very futuristic.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it. You mentioned you don't drive. If you did, how do you think your driving skills would be?

**Speaker 2:**
I think I would be a good driver.

**Speaker 1:**
Now, let's watch this video. If anything stands out to you or makes you uncomfortable, feel free to let me know.

**Speaker 2:**
Sure, I'll let you know.
**Speaker 1:** During the drive, if there are any moments that stand out to you or make you feel uncomfortable, please let me know at any time. I will also be asking you some questions throughout the process. How did you feel when making that turn?

**Speaker 2:** I didn't feel much during that turn.

**Speaker 1:** Did you feel anything at other times?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I did feel something.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel when entering this road?

**Speaker 2:** I felt a bit uneasy.

**Speaker 1:** Why do you think that is?

**Speaker 2:** It might be because of the unfamiliar environment. The road seemed a bit narrow, which made me feel uncomfortable. 

**Speaker 1:** So, it's more about the surrounding space and the narrow road rather than the environment itself?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, that's right.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel when the electric vehicle came from behind?

**Speaker 2:** It felt a bit cramped and made me uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:** Did it make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, but not too much.

**Speaker 1:** Do you think this is a normal phenomenon?

**Speaker 2:** It's normal, but it still makes me feel a bit uneasy.

**Speaker 1:** Was this section of the road driven at a steady speed or was there acceleration?

**Speaker 2:** I think it was a mix of both.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel during the steady speed driving?

**Speaker 2:** I wished it could go a bit faster. If this were my usual route to school, I would feel a bit anxious and want to speed up to avoid being late.

**Speaker 1:** Was that a U-turn just now? The driver reversed and then turned. How did you feel about that?

**Speaker 2:** I was worried that a car from behind might crash into us while we were stuck there.

**Speaker 1:** So, you were concerned about safety?

**Speaker 2:** Yes.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel when the driver accelerated in a straight line?

**Speaker 2:** It felt good. It gave me a bit of a thrill, which I enjoyed because my life feels monotonous, and I seek some excitement to feel happy.

**Speaker 1:** So, when the driver accelerates, you should feel happy rather than uncomfortable, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, but it depends on the situation and my mood at the time.

**Speaker 1:** How did you feel when passing through that intersection?

**Speaker 2:** As the vehicle turned and transitioned from one scene to another, I felt a shift in my emotions, like moving from a high point to a low point or vice versa.

**Speaker 1:** Did this affect your sense of safety or comfort during the drive?

**Speaker 2:** It didn't affect my comfort much.
**Speaker 1:** Does driving on this road change your sense of safety or comfort?

**Speaker 2:** I don't feel any difference in comfort. The angle of the sunlight has changed, so now it shines directly on me, making it feel hotter.

**Speaker 2:** I was driving on a road and suddenly turned onto a very narrow, tree-lined path. It felt like I was entering an adventure or a challenging situation.

**Speaker 1:** Did it make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:** No, I found it quite mysterious and intriguing.

**Speaker 1:** Are you a humanities student?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I am. This road is my favorite. On the left, there's a very European-style building, and there are steps filled with shrubs. It reminds me of the square at my school. I find it very beautiful, although the road is a bit bumpy.

**Speaker 1:** You mean the bump we just hit, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, exactly. I was admiring the scenery when we hit that bump. It startled me a bit.

**Speaker 1:** If you frequently encounter such bumps and aren't paying much attention to the surroundings, how do you feel?

**Speaker 1:** Are there any buses or large vehicles that suddenly pass by on this road?

**Speaker 2:** This is another road I really like. It's wide, with blue skies and white clouds, and the buildings are new. Although there's no river, the flow of traffic feels like a river to me.

**Speaker 1:** When driving by the river, do you notice the scenery more than the other vehicles?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, I focus more on the scenery because it's more open.

**Speaker 1:** How do you feel about the driver's actions when pedestrians cross the road?

**Speaker 2:** I feel quite confident in the driver. He drives slowly and seems skilled.

**Speaker 2:** We're back on my favorite road, with the same buildings and steps. It makes me daydream about what could have been if I had gone to a different school. This road sparks a lot of imagination, which is why I like it so much.

**Speaker 1:** How do you feel when pedestrians cross the road?

**Speaker 2:** It feels like I'm being chased by a swarm of mosquitoes.

**Speaker 1:** What do pedestrians have to do with mosquitoes?

**Speaker 2:** They remind me of insects swarming around.
**Speaker 1:**  
How did you feel during the drive?

**Speaker 2:**  
I felt like I was being chased by a swarm of mosquitoes.

**Speaker 1:**  
What do you mean by that? How are pedestrians related to mosquitoes?

**Speaker 2:**  
I felt like they were buzzing around like insects, everywhere.

**Speaker 1:**  
So, how did this affect your experience as a passenger?

**Speaker 2:**  
It made me feel a bit unsafe.

**Speaker 1:**  
Why did you feel unsafe specifically?

**Speaker 2:**  
I was worried that if we weren't careful, our car might accidentally hit someone.

**Speaker 2:**  
However, driving on this road was quite pleasant because the buildings on both sides were painted a beautiful red color.

**Speaker 1:**  
Are most of the buildings around here that color? It seems like a common theme.

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, but driving on Chengguo Road always puts me in a bad mood. The traffic there is quite complicated.

**Speaker 1:**  
What else did you notice? Did you feel any pressure from the buses?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, especially on Route 7. You have to wait a long time at the red lights before you can turn, which is very frustrating.

**Speaker 1:**  
Did you notice any dangerous behavior from the driver during this experiment?

**Speaker 2:**  
Yes, he was using his phone sometimes.

**Speaker 1:**  
Was he looking at the route on his phone or something else?

**Speaker 2:**  
I think he was just checking something briefly.

**Speaker 1:**  
In your opinion, what would make driving safer? Any suggestions based on this experiment or your usual experiences?

**Speaker 2:**  
Generally, the driver seemed reliable, but it took a long time to make turns, and there were so many cars.

**Speaker 1:**  
How did the heavy traffic make you feel?

**Speaker 2:**  
Unsafe.

**Speaker 1:**  
Can you explain why you felt unsafe?

**Speaker 2:**  
It felt chaotic and unpredictable, like danger could come at any moment. The road is supposed to be for non-motorized vehicles, but I often see motor vehicles speeding by. The lane is very narrow, and it feels unsafe because non-motorized vehicles are pushed to the left, into the path of motor vehicles, and vice versa. It feels like being squeezed from both sides.

**Speaker 2:**  
Sometimes, an electric scooter would suddenly appear from the right, and it would startle me.
**Speaker 1:** Sometimes, it feels like you're being pushed from side to side, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, and sometimes an electric bike suddenly appears on the right, and you instinctively swerve to the left. But then, there might be a large vehicle coming from behind.

**Speaker 1:** That can be very dangerous, right?

**Speaker 2:** Exactly.

**Speaker 1:** I understand. So, when you're a passenger in someone else's car, what behaviors from the driver make you feel unsafe?

**Speaker 2:** Mainly, it's when they look at their phone.

**Speaker 1:** Oh, so other drivers also look at their phones, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yes.

**Speaker 1:** How do you define safety in driving?

**Speaker 2:** Safety in driving means not speeding, not crashing, and not being crashed into. Following the rules is important, even if the ride is bumpy. Speeding is a bigger concern.

**Speaker 1:** So, bumps in the road make you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** Actually, I don't mind small bumps. I kind of like the feeling.

**Speaker 1:** What about large bumps?

**Speaker 2:** Large bumps are different. I don't like those as much.

**Speaker 1:** Did the driver today do anything that made you uncomfortable?

**Speaker 2:** No, everything was okay.

**Speaker 1:** When you're a passenger, what behaviors from others make you uncomfortable? This could be the driver, other passengers, or even pedestrians.

**Speaker 2:** Mainly, it's things inside the car. If the driver smokes, the smell bothers me. Or if they talk too much, I wish they would be quiet. Also, if the car is too crowded, it feels uncomfortable.

**Speaker 1:** So, you don't like it when the car is too cramped?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, if there are too many passengers, it's uncomfortable. Also, if the driver plays loud music, it's very noisy. I prefer a quiet environment.

**Speaker 1:** You like a quieter setting in the car?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, if everyone is talking, the noise gets amplified in the confined space of the car, making it even louder and more annoying.

**Speaker 1:** I see. How do you define comfort in a car?

**Speaker 2:** Comfort for me is having a good headrest. Some car headrests are uncomfortable, especially with the car's movement. My head keeps moving back and forth, making it hard to sleep. If the headrest supports my head well, I can fall asleep quickly because the car's motion feels like a cradle.

**Speaker 1:** So, you prefer an environment where you can easily fall asleep?

**Speaker 2:** Yes, because it gives me a cradle-like feeling.
**Speaker 1:**
So, you prefer an environment where you can easily fall asleep, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, because it gives me a cradle-like feeling. But if it makes my head bob back and forth, then I can't sleep.

**Speaker 1:**
Ah, I see. Besides comfort, do you have any other criteria for defining a good driving experience?

**Speaker 2:**
Mainly the seatback. If the seatback can't be adjusted backward, I have to sit upright, which makes it hard to sleep. Also, if the legroom is narrow and my legs are long, it can be quite troublesome. Additionally, I prefer a quiet environment without smoking. That's about it.

**Speaker 1:**
What do you think makes a driver professional? What qualities or actions make you feel that a driver is good and professional?

**Speaker 2:**
A driver doesn't need to be overly enthusiastic. They should follow the rules, not smoke, keep quiet, and avoid playing loud music. Driving smoothly and at a reasonable speed is also important.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it. What do you think is the biggest difference between a novice driver and an experienced driver?

**Speaker 2:**
The biggest difference is their attention to rules. Experienced drivers might become overconfident and neglect the rules, which can easily lead to accidents.

**Speaker 1:**
Do you think today's driver is a novice or an experienced driver?

**Speaker 2:**
I think today's driver is an experienced one who understands the rules well.

**Speaker 1:**
In your opinion, what aspects of driving can autonomous cars never replicate, no matter how advanced they become?

**Speaker 2:**
There are some choices that autonomous cars might never make like humans do. For example, on the same road, I might prefer to drive slightly to the right, but the autonomous car might choose to drive in the middle or to the left. This flexibility in decision-making is something autonomous cars struggle with.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you think autonomous driving lacks the flexibility that human drivers have in choosing their path?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, humans can drive based on their preferences, but autonomous cars might make random choices.

**Speaker 1:**
You mean autonomous cars make random choices when selecting roads, right? Are there any other aspects?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, and there are also some...
**Speaker 1:**
So, you think that the autonomous driving system randomly selects roads, right? Are there any other aspects you are concerned about?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, there are also issues with how it judges the current traffic conditions on the road. We need to understand how well it can recognize these situations.

**Speaker 1:**
Are you saying it might fail to recognize certain things?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, there have been instances where it misidentified objects.

**Speaker 1:**
Like causing an accident? I remember hearing about an incident where it mistook a barrier for a road. Oh, right, that's alarming. So, do you think today's drive was done by an autonomous system or a human driver?

**Speaker 2:**
I think it was a human driver today.

**Speaker 1:**
Why do you think it was a human driver?

**Speaker 2:**
Because the driver was actively steering the wheel.

**Speaker 1:**
Are you sure it wasn't just the driver simulating the driving while the car was in autonomous mode? If today's car was actually in autonomous mode with a safety driver present, how would that affect your experience compared to previous rides?

**Speaker 2:**
I would feel uneasy. I don't trust autonomous driving.

**Speaker 1:**
Why not?

**Speaker 2:**
I just don't believe it's accurate. There are many situations where even humans struggle to make the right judgment, so I doubt a machine could do better.

**Speaker 1:**
Were there any moments today that made you feel like the car wasn't being driven by a human?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I felt like a real person was driving the car.

**Speaker 1:**
What is your definition of intelligence in the context of autonomous driving?

**Speaker 2:**
Intelligence means it can recognize traffic lights, distinguish between roads and barriers, automatically determine your location using GPS, control the car's position, slow down when approaching a red light, detect potholes and reduce speed, identify nearby electric bikes and avoid them, sense large trucks approaching from behind and take evasive action, and even adjust the window shades if the sunlight is too strong.

**Speaker 1:**
Or change the window tint, right? It should also automatically adjust the air conditioning if it's too hot and modify the seat position based on your body type.

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, exactly.

**Speaker 1:**
So, as a pedestrian, how do you feel about crossing the street when an autonomous car is approaching?
**Speaker 1:**
Based on your body type or the conditions here, how do you usually adjust your seat?

**Speaker 2:**
Adjust the seat? Yes, that's right.

**Speaker 1:**
When you're a pedestrian at an intersection without traffic lights, how do you identify the intentions of nearby vehicles or non-motorized vehicles? For example, whether they intend to stop, go straight, or turn?

**Speaker 2:**
I feel like I can't predict their intentions. I just don't try to interpret them.

**Speaker 1:**
So, do you wait for all the vehicles to pass before you cross? 

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I wait until they make their decision before I make mine.

**Speaker 1:**
So, you observe and proceed step by step, right? You don't wait for all the cars to pass completely before crossing; you choose to observe and move accordingly, correct? Or do you have another approach?

**Speaker 2:**
I usually wait for about 80% of the cars to pass. When I am sure the remaining ones won't pose a danger to me, I proceed. I judge based on my feeling whether they pose a threat. If they don't, I might even cross against a red light if it's safe.

**Speaker 1:**
Got it.

**Speaker 1:**
That about wraps up our questions for today. Do you have any questions or suggestions for us?

**Speaker 2:**
No, I don't.

**Speaker 1:**
Alright, I'll stop the recording then. Are you planning to head back now?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, I am. I found our conversation interesting, but many parts weren't directly related to our questions, so I didn't continue. If we weren't recording, I'd love to chat more, especially about cityscapes and such. Unfortunately, time is limited.

**Speaker 2:**
Our institute has many VR setups where you can walk through virtual streets and describe your experience.

**Speaker 1:**
So, it's purely about psychological states, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, it might be about studying pure visual perception.

**Speaker 1:**
We're mainly interested in the experience of being in a vehicle and how the road conditions affect that.

**Speaker 2:**
Honestly, I feel pretty good about it. I adapt well to the hardware.

**Speaker 1:**
That's good to hear.

**Speaker 2:**
The external environment also has a significant impact.

**Speaker 1:**
So, in your research, do you consider the surrounding buildings and such?

**Speaker 2:**
Yes, we do. Any building can have a significant psychological impact. Even a single tree can make a difference.
Speaker 1:
Are those buildings and things like that affecting you?

Speaker 2:
Yes, I do notice them. Any building placed here can have a significant impact on my mood. For example, if there's a tree planted here, my mood changes immediately. Or if there's a car parked by the roadside, whether it's parked or not can affect my mood.

Speaker 1:
That's completely different. You're so sensitive, haha.

Speaker 2:
Yes, and this happens at different times of the day. My mood keeps changing based on what I see.

Speaker 1:
It feels like you have a very artistic temperament, very eloquent, haha. Your emotions are so delicate and rich.
